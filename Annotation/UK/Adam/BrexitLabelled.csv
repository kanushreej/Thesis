> From what I understand being an LGBTQI is acceptable and the tabloids wouldn't probe into their private life. 

Generally speaking, and only relatively recently. It wasn't so long ago that ""outing"" homosexuals was a tabloid sport. Now homosexuality etc is (generally speaking) culturally acceptable, it isn't taboo, there is no prurience or other interest in someone being LGBTQI (not in the mass media). Unless for example if someone publicly critical or against LGBTQI is found themself to be LGBTQI, that would be a story.

Relatively ""normal"" things can still be taboo. It's about cultural opinion isn't it?

[edit]

Two examples of interest in private life that spring to mind:

A British actor, well known from starring in a very popular TV period drama, who was the subject of an injunction that prohibited the media from naming him as being involved in BDSM with prostitutes. (I won't say his name here as I do not know if the injunction is still in effect.)

Fred Goodwin, who still AFAIK has an injunction prohibiting the media from naming a senior colleague with whom he was alleged to have had an extra-marital affair for several years. It wouldn't be an interesting story except that the affair was linked (in a gossipy sense) with the near-collapse of the Royal Bank of Scotland and the wider financial crisis.",2018-01-06T13:12:04+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes. Especially to places like the south of Spain.

Convenience is a big thing. But it's also often cheap. By booking it all as a package they give you good rates on things. And it often includes things like airport pick up and other things that you then don't have to organise yourself. A package holiday just takes so much off your plate in terms of organising. Some people are very busy and/or simply don't want to spend time researching and booking things individually.

>3) Are their penalties if you do things that are not included in the package? 

No.

AskUK,comment,european,jsrdocc,jeffcarpthefisheater,,"Hi, I'm an English guy who's lived in Italy for nearly 15 years. And I'm not going back to the UK ever because of the lifestyle here.

What is important to note is that some things, you can't just copy. We have long warm summers here, it's nice to just be out and about at 11pm on a Tuesday for an ice cream- not really a 5 in April or October in the UK! And the drinking culture is very different, one or two drinks in an evening max, the idea is to be with friends, not get drunk. And Italians tend to eat and go to bed later in the day- these things are very cultural in context with others doing the same, so carbon copying won't work.

I can say that, as others suggested here, really separating work from personal time- especially at weekends. Italians are very much the type to leave the workplace at the time they are contracted. This is also linked to how low wages are over here, though.

Try to keep your weekends as free as possible. Italians really value their free time to be with family and friends, go the lakes, mountains, beach (refer back to my point about the weather), enjoy a nice long lunch, spend an evening making good food at home- hardly ever do you see them  fretting about going to the tip, complaining about the garden centre queues, only ever going tonthe supermarket on a Saturday morning.

My last insight is a mindset change. Brits are in a rush to get stuff done, in a panic that they must enjoy something, feel they're entitled to have certain experiences more than others. You can't change other's ways of thinking about life, but on Saturday me and my wife just decided, that morning, to go for lunch in beautiful town nearby. We got the train there, walked around the town and asked a few restaurants before we found one that could fit us in. We went home after and made pasta, from scratch, for dinner with a bottle of wine. Because we had kept the weekend free, it was easy and because we didn't need to book anything in advance, it was stress free.",2023-07-20T18:08:45+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

AskUK,comment,passport,kfywjgl,Appropriate-Bench619,,"This is a rather long story but hopefully worth the read for those who want to hear a real life idiot abroad. I had a massive blunder a few years ago, although I feel the need to stress that this was rather uncharacteristic of me - I've never missed a flight/being late etc.

I was in Nicaragua, and decided to book a last minute flight to see my friend in NY from Costa Rica with a stopover in El Salvador (anything to save a few quid whilst backpacking...). Managed all of the logistics of getting to San Jose, and onto my flight, it was only when we arrived in El Salvador that we got booted off the plane and asked to reboard that I realised that I didn't have an ESTA and they wouldn't let me board. Cue me frantically trying to fill in the form prior to reboarding, hoping in vain it would be approved prior to take off, but asking for my bag to be taken out of the hold. Lo and behold, everyone boarded, and I was left watching my connection start to pull out of the gate as I got an email confirming the approval of my ESTA.

Thought that would be the end of it; I had managed to find a connecting flight later that day, a couple hundred quid out of pocket, a funny story to share and a rather embarrassing message to send with my friend explaining that I wouldn't be seeing him that evening. When I arrived in NY, I was going through security, and was asked how long I was staying for. ""I'm not sure, probably Wednesday or Thursday, still looking for a flight to São Paulo tbh"" wasn't the answer they were looking for, and got penned in with immigration. 

This was an insight as to itself, for anyone who's passed through immigration in the US, you'll know they're not the friendliest of bunches, and this is even worse for Latin American flights. That each person in turn is cross examined in front of everyone is mortifying enough, with border security seemingly unaware of the fact that if someone doesn't speak English, that shouting at them increasingly loudly won't help them to understand what's being asked. The highlight was probably an El Salvadorian mother and her daughter being asked ""WHAT IS YOUR NAME"", who responded rather proudly after the fifth ask with ""Estados Unidos"" and a big smile.

After a couple of hours, I was summoned up, and having observed the past couple of hours I decided the best course of action was to play the idiot (rightly so) and plead complete ignorance with a Hugh Grant-esque persona. This involved me relating the reason why I had arrived on another flight to the one I was due to arrive on, with a suspicious stop over in El Salvador, was due to the fact I needed an ESTA, all of which could be verified. It essentially came down to ""awfully sorry gentlemen, don't want to make excuses but it's one of those things that slopped through the cracks. I've crossed two borders, had loads of paperwork to do, and generally I'm a bit aloof"", and stating that I was happy to book an onward flight on the spot. The two officers were openly discussing my idiocy in front of me, with one saying ""I just refuse to believe someone could be that stupid"", and the other deciding to give me 30 days simply to do away with me.

All in all a very humbling and stressful experience, which is actually one of my more cherished memories now. It was also a massive lesson into the privilege we enjoy as British citizens, not a chance I would have had that outcome were it not the case.

TLDR: Get your documents done in advance, and try not to stress about situations, so long as you're not in harm you'll see the funny side one day.",2024-01-02T12:33:00+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

AskUK,comment,reforms,jubzhxs,Biggidybo,,"My wife is a Dentist.

The government are making it difficult for the dentist's to make money so many are going private (gov's intention? who knows).

The gov. gives the NHS contract to a Provider, who in turn has a contract with a dentist.
So if the Provider is paid £30 per UDA a dentist could be paid £20, with the provider taking the margin.

With many foreign dentists coming in, who are not British trained and complaints/legal action increasing, the cost of insurance has increased.

Also to note, it is not cheap to train a Dentist, they have to have many materials and equipment at hand.

This is the jist of it, I hear from my wife.

My advice would be to marry a dentist, but you are still not gaureenteed to be seen, as her boss is an ahole who doesnt allow family members in :/

AskUK,comment,uk,l5j773u,EtTuBrotus,,"What became of the chav, you ask?

That’s a good question. 

Once a noble and proud race that could be found almost everywhere in Britain, the Chav people seem to have disappeared.

Some have matured into their adult state, raising young chav children. The burden of parenthood means these chavs have moved on from their youth of drinking and smoking in supermarket car parks. Now they spend their days dressing their children in baby gucci and posting about it incessantly on facebook.

Others have adapted to a new niche, that of the Roadman. Once chavs discovered the invention of the balaclava, a new religious order emerged in which they glorify knife crime and worship e-bikes.

Yet still you may find the odd staunch traditionalist on our streets. The old chav, left behind by his tribe for refusing to abandon The Old Ways. This noble savage still partakes in the daily ritual of drinking a six pack of carling outside of an off license at 10am on a Wednesday. Like a Native American Chief, he carries wisdom and reverence for the old ways.

If you’re lucky, you may find yourself one day on your local council estate and encounter a Chav, and you will know that here at least, the old ways are still alive",2024-05-24T21:59:50+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can right now look at the stats for the average temp in your city last year vs 15 years ago and I imagine for most it increased at least 0.5 degF. In Florida it went up 1.1 degF over 11 years. 0.5 degF, big deal. I believe it was stated that a global rise of 4.0 degF would result in a runaway planet, where it would forever get hotter, even if we no longer existed. ([good song about that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8skBtGbi6U)).

You can help to make it personal by looking at the weather. there's been more hurricanes. more tornadoes. more fires. and i believe even more earthquakes. [https://www.overshootday.org/](https://www.overshootday.org/)",2022-07-02T05:33:12+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,
Climatechange,comment,conservatives,ijisuyq,Giovoni_x,,"Looking at ocean pH data, I was stunned to find how much it has degraded in the last 25 years, but the rise in ocean temps means that oceans have less capacity to carry O2, which maybe more significant to ocean health, and as measured by the growth in ""dead zones"" .

Conservative,comment,conservatives,l0vtkop,ITrCool,,"This is why I'm not party affiliated. Haven't been for a few years now.

Too many people out there on both sides of the political spectrum voting ""party line"" and not voting on the issues themselves and being informed and educated. Instead, we teach our children that voting is ""pick a color/party and vote that all the way down the line. DO NOT choose anything else!"". i.e. - red vs blue voting.

That's not real voting at all.

Real voting is:

* Taking the time at least a month ahead to research each candidate. Yes, it will take time and work and study. What does each person stand for, putting party entirely aside? Who do you best-align with? Some may not be Republicans or Democrats. some may just be independent tickets. If they're incumbent running again, how good of a job did they do? What do they have to show for it over their last term?
* Going into the polling center and carefully looking at your options. Maybe taking a sheet in with you to reference who you felt like you'd like to vote for. Even if that means it takes you 30 minutes to fill out your ballot, then fine.
* Accepting that not all of your choices will be GOP or DEM or whatever party you align with. My last ballot was all over the place in the 2020 election. I even voted locally for a Dem who was a lot more level-headed and moderate (not an extremist left nutjob like most of them are) and had actually done a very good job in their role with the city I lived in at the time (I think they were more centrist and just running under the Dem ticket to help with gaining votes).

Voting strictly party line and not bothering to research is one of the blindest, waste-of-time ways to vote. You vote based on faith that every person in the party believes as you do and aligns with you, and thus you have no idea who you're actually voting to give power to (including voting in RINOs).",2024-04-23T13:03:33+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

Democrats,post,europe,9clohl,ihatejoemcCarthy,Trump's leeches in the Republican Party tried to put up a front at Senator McCain's funeral. They tried to show us that they'd follow his wishes. But as soon as they left the church they're back into using Trump's Russian friends to hack in to the Dem members' computers to win their midterms.,"In today's OP-ED ""They Sat in Hypocrisy"" in NYT David Leonhardt gave a clear picture of what those Republican honchos are, the ones attended John McCain's funeral sitting near the front  in Washington National Cathedral  : They're hypocrites. 
 
David was also right when he told us this in his piece ""Congressional Republicans made a show of honoring John McCain even as they continue to reject his principles.""

To David's lines I also like to add that if hypocrisy was the only word in the dictionary to describe what the congressional Republicans are, then maybe we could give them a pass.

But there are some real ugly words written in the dictionary that could be used here to describe a bunch of 'compromats'.

From being strong Russia foes, the current Republican Party is Russia  lovers now.

They forgot that their ideal president in the eighties Ronald Reagan hated Soviet Union then. He was the president who said famously on June 12,1987,""General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate ! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this Wall."" 

No wonder then General Secretary of Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev got scared and tore down the Berlin Wall separating West Germany and it's eastern communist counterpart. Russians then, unlike now under their current President Putin, didn't hesitate to do what an American president wanted them to do because of a 3 : 1 advantage in nuclear arsenals that our United States had over Soviet Union throughout the eighties.

Even Democratic President Kennedy before that caught the First Secretary of the communist Party of the Soviet Union Nikita Khruschev's bluff in 1962 and forced him to withdraw all the nuclear missiles from Cuba after our American president made them to sign an agreement on November 20,'62. This humiliating experience for a Soviet leader happened after a harrowing and very frightful 13 days, known as Cuban missile crisis that started on October 16th and lasted till October 28th, in 1962.

But what are the current honchos in the G.O.P. are doing right now?

They're giving in to their current president Trump's demands that America should be subservient to the current Russian premier Putin, no matter what.

No wonder the big shots of the Republican party are now doing just that . 

Although this bunch of Republicans looked so quiet and respectful looking at the coffin of Mr. McCain at the Capitol rotunda but that was just a front, nothing else . 

What we didn't notice on our tv screens was that although the big names from the Republican party stood in silence and looked mournful at their Senator John McCain's funeral but we know for sure that they'd not do what their friend and ex-colleague wanted them to do.

These Republican leeches have no desire to show any true respect to the ""Maverick""'s real desire before he succumbed to the brain cancer : to stop Russia from meddling in our elections.

Why ?

Because Mr. McCain's Senate and House leaders know only one thing, ""Country be damned if we can't keep the congress in our control.""

Despite some autocratic hiccups like Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua most of Latin America is liberal, democratic and progressive.

There is a lot of American influence in the culture, even if they don't like to accept it. In Argentina, maybe because of their history and their geographic position, the European influence is way stronger than the US, but the US still has a influence nevertheless.

The level and type of intervention and/or involvement that the American public will support is not static, it's very much dynamic and will depend on the circumstances of the moment.  I think part of the reason why you've seen public support for Ukraine's fight change in polls such as Gallup is because the 2023 counter-offensive was greatly overhyped by too many people.

Military spending is up there, but it's definitely not the highest federal expenditure.  The United States, even under a second Trump presidency, isn't going to leave NATO for many different reasons.  Whatever you may personally care about, whether it be healthcare, military or whatnot the greatest risk to United States stability is the federal deficit spending and current debt load.  The level of incompetence and corruption that has been occurring at the federal level is not sustainable, it is a far greater risk than Russia and China combined.

Geopolitics,comment,freedom movement,du9xmwr,annadpk,,"The most anti-Japanese sentiment I heard from an Indonesian was the sixty year old man I met in 1980s who was made to do slave labor by the Japanese during WW2. Those sentiments were very common in Indonesia up until the 1980s, despite all the Japanese aid the country was getting.  But by the 1990s, when most of survivors were starting to pass away, there is a marked decline.

As for Korea, its perpetuated by their school text books, propaganda and politics. Park Chung Hee, the Korean dictator, was an officer in the Imperial Japanese Army in Manchuria. Many of South Korea's generals during the Korean War once served under elite Japanese unit responsible for war crimes in Manchuria. 
With the Koreans its less about what the Japanese did to them during the occupation prior to the War.  Only a couple thousand Koreans died fighting the Japanese from 1910-1941. There is a large degree of self-hate particularly toward the Korean elite that collaborated with the Japanese, many of them who belong to the establishment in South Korea.

http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_editorial/731291.html

Anti-Japanese feeling in South Korea is more internal politics than what the Japanese did in Korea.  The left uses it to bash the right in South Korea, and that includes Park Chung Hee and his daughter.Unlike in China, anti-Japanese sentiment doesn't really unite the country, in fact it makes the country more divided. That is why I think its very unhealthy for South Korea. to constantly fixated with Japan.

If activated, patient's are required to obtain approval from a judge if they want to discharge or the judge can have the state become responsible for their care until they are better enough to understand and make rational decisions.

If someone is depressed or psychotic, refusing treatment, and wants to discharge so they can kill themselves, it is unsafe to discharge them bc their condition is so severe that they cannot maintain safety and they do not show appropriate understanding of their illness. 

If you hit your head and have a life-threatening brain bleed, and you want to discharge bc you think it's just a headache and you don't really need surgery, they can assess you for medical decision making capacity (aka do you understand the decision).

Like it or not, socialism is an authoritarian system, you can't abolish private property by just hoping the bourgeoisie decide to give it up voluntarily, and bourgeois democracy will forever be under the control of capital, name a Socialist country that had the same parliamentary system as the EU or UK


>Not really, it's a lot easier to build an internation community of social democratic states, and slowly move towards democratic socialism, than to turn one country socialist and then sit there and wait for other countries to join you via spontaneous global revolution, nationalist socialism has already been tried, it did not go well.

Sure, but democratic socialism ≠ socialism, and democratic socialists have never been reliable allies of socialists either, besides that, somebody needs to be the first and to support socialist uprisings in other nations, imagine Vietnam without the backing of the soviet union for example, would have been obliterated, a Socialist uk is extremely unlikely as I said, but the entire EU becoming socialist is much more unlikely, and would have to include the UK becoming Socialist anyway

>Nothing is impossible within a democratic organisation, nor was the EU the biggest stumbling block in Labour's plans, the EU was a huge asset in Labours plans, because we live in an age of multi-national corporations and opposing them is only effective if you control a large chunk of global power.

Sure, because Labour weren't elected, if they were they'd face huge pushback

> It was? Nothing in the 2019 manifesto was against EU regulations.

Just because it wasn't in the manifesto doesn't mean it doesn't exist, look at the state aid control act or the fourth railway package, EU law designed specifically to block or reverse Nationalisation

>Even if you were right, which I don't think you are, the time to quit is when the UK is hitting the problems, not because hypothetically we might have problems moving towards socialism at some point in the future, but currently the EU, despite it's neo-liberal origins, is the only thing fighting multi-national corporate greed.

Sure, I agree with you on this, under the Tories I'd rather be in than out, I was just talking about why it would be a problem down the road if we were to become socialist, but that doesn't matter now because we are already leaving


>Well given that European immigrants were a net positive per person, it's a zero-sum game. Having a stronger economy allows us to take in more immigrants (from anywhere), having a week economy and an expensive and complex immigration system does not. The alternatives to EU membership for immigration are much worse:

Sure, but what makes them better than non European immigrants?  For what reasons should Europeans and non Europeans not be treated equally?


>* Work visas - e.g give capital leverage over workers, I'm sure that will work great

These already exist, it's just that they're only for non EU citizens, which makes them far stricter and more exploitative

>* Points based system - e.g reducing somebodies human value to their current account balance

We literally already do that, my wife and daughter coming to this country literally relies on meeting a certain salary, EU or not

I'm not saying either of these should exist, I'm just saying exempting Europeans from these while enforcing them for everyone else makes them stricter as they can afford to keep more non Europeans out when Europeans are filling the majority of our immigration needs, again why should non Europeans be treated worse than Europeans simply for not being born in Europe?",2020-03-06T12:52:02+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

Labour,comment,johnson,htbzvpw,GibbNotGibbs,,">He started from ""quite"" a low base though didn't he?! And which policies got us that low base?

You've completely ignored my point. In 2019, Corbyn won Batley with 43% of the vote. In 2021, Starmer won Batley with 35%. So Labour started their campaign in Batley from a place that was relatively higher, not lower.

&#x200B;

>What did you make of that?

Nice attempt at dodging the fact that Starmer's a shit leader. Whataboutcorbyn isn't an argument in favour of Starmer. What I think about Corbyn is completely irrelevant to the question of whether Starmer is a good leader. The by-election stuff isn't even an opinion: it's factually incorrect to say that Starmer is more electable than Corbyn. The statistics simply do not support that hypothesis.

&#x200B;

>The country still votes in a centrist manner doesnt it?

What do you mean by centrism?

&#x200B;

>so far left that it scares away crucial votes?

Nationalising public services is overwhelmingly popular. Public ownership of defence, aerospace, rail, gas, electricity and water all have the support of two-thirds or more of the British public.

And I suspect you think the crucial voters are the Tory voters. They are not. The people worth pursuing are infrequent and non-voters. If Brexit taught us anything, it was that targetting a half million non-voters in a blitz of digital ads is how you swing an election in your favour.",2022-01-19T16:13:46+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

Or are you asking yet more unreasonable nonsense of innocent Gazans?

If I may be frank, in a parallel universe somewhere, Israel is being infinitely more clever in its reaction to Oct 7th, and rather than bombing Gaza to hell is pulling every covert string it and its allies can to bring Hamas down from the inside, thus actually allowing a new negotiator party to emerge. I might be completely wrong on the feasibility of this, but it strikes me as a far better plan than what is currently being done, which i fear will bring more terror and misery down the road, not just now.

""I'm not racist"" is prob the #1 reason ppl vote Biden. ""I don't like traitors and rapists"" follows closely.

President Biden fought for and signed the American Rescue Plan which protected workers’ pensions, provided funding to communities and businesses devastated by COVID-19, lowered or eliminated insurance premiums for millions of lower- and middle-income families, provided funds for affordable housing, provided money for public safety and crime reduction, provided support to small business, expanded food assistance programs in homes and schools, expanded child care programs, invested in mental health and health care centers, added $40 billion for investing in American workers, provided funding to the economies of tribal nations, and supported families with children. Child poverty has already been cut in half as a result of his efforts.

He signed a $1 trillion infrastructure bill to repair our roads, waterways, bridges and railroads, and bring high-speed internet to rural communities. Also included is money for public transit and airports, electric vehicles and low emission public transportation, power infrastructure, and clean water.

Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. This law provides incentives for states to pass red flag laws, expands the law that prevents people convicted of domestic abuse from gun ownership, expands background checks on young people between 18 and 21 who want to buy a gun, and allocates funds for the mental health of young people.

He instituted an executive order raising standards for law enforcement agencies, with particular emphasis on use-of-force policies, availability of body cameras, and recruitment and retention of officers.

He brought the unemployment rate down to a low of 3.5%, matching the lowest rate before the pandemic. It has now climbed a bit to 3.8%, but this compares very favorably to the rates of other countries throughout the world. Biden’s administration has added 13.2 million jobs since he came into office, replacing all of the jobs that were lost at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. Today there are more people in America working today than ever before!

He signed a bill to help veterans who have long been suffering from the effects of burn pits.

Biden ended the war in Afghanistan, the longest war in U.S. history. Over 120,000 people were safely evacuated, double the number calculated by the most optimistic experts.

He has steadfastly supported Ukraine after this democratic country was unjustly invaded by Putin and Russia, and has successfully led the free world by lobbying NATO and other allies to add their financial and military support.

He signed the Inflation Reduction Act, making health insurance plans more affordable, lowering drug costs, preventing millions of Americans from losing their Affordable Care Act insurance, and requiring Medicare to negotiate the cost of 10 high-cost prescription drugs.

Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act, providing funding to produce semiconductor chips for automobiles, cellphones, laptops, gaming consoles, washing machines, etc. here in the Unites States rather than continuing to rely on China.

His administration has provided over $369 million to reduce greenhouse emissions by 40% in the next seven years and promote clean energy technologies, moving our country to greater self-sufficiency in energy production.

He signed the Postal Service Reform Act to modernize and stabilize the U.S. Post Office and also to help it continue to deliver mail six days every week, focusing on on-time delivery.

Other accomplishments include the reestablishment of respect among our allies on the world stage, the Violence Against Women Act, the Respect for Marriage Act, pardoning those convicted of simple marijuana possession, appointing Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson (the first Black woman on the Supreme Court), forgiving certain student loans, and electoral reforms to ensure that election results are not undermined.",2024-01-31T14:30:52+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

How so? If you question power it’s at least implied that you’re demanding something different, and activism makes demands. Maybe Bloom et al just didn’t like what was being questioned *and* demanded, which is what Chom was saying. 

>I don't think we've seen any major or sustained society on earth that exists independent of traditions and hierarchy.

That’s pretty broad; he didn’t even refer to traditions as a concept, much less say they were undesirable. And he’s not even against hierarchy/leadership either, he’s just saying that they shouldn’t be entrenched. Have you done a deep dive into more horizontally-organized societies throughout human history? 

> Compared to what alternative?

Social democratic reforms that curb the influence of the financially powerful over those who are not. For example, if the US implemented Medicare for All, the *market* would indeed be affected, but as it stands now Americans have the “freedom” to choose between many usually overpriced and often inadequate options for insurance, whose corporate practices they have little to no influence over. M4A would need a large-enough group of ordinary people supporting it to work, and grassroots activism of that kind is fuelling the resurgence of that idea as we speak. Kaiser Permanente isn’t exactly a mom-and-pop operation that the town needs to band together and save with a bake sale.

But that convenience comes at the cost of a ton of pollution, traffic jams (which exacerbate it), accidents, efficiency (buses and subways carry lots of people at once), and the price of gas and maintenance that not everyone can pay. And there’s evidence that sufficient public transit [makes people happier and healthier](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11095120/Getting-the-bus-or-train-to-work-makes-us-happier-than-driving-study-finds.html) and it’s a factor in how “livable” a city is said to be, along with walkability and bikability. 

>This is also an insufficient argument to support your position.

Well, what *would* be a valid argument in your eyes? For me, the fact that not everyone can drive—or even get around on their own at all—is reason enough to have good public transit. It sounds as though you just don’t care about other people’s problems, which strikes me as pretty un-Christlike for someone with a Bible verse in their flair (which is basically the Hannibal Buress “why are you booing me? I’m right!” meme).",2019-11-25T06:22:56+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

>Why spend 70 years building up American dominance only to dismantle it once Russia bares its fangs? What was the point of establishing the spheres of influence?

You also do not need to dismantle US dominance in order to ask a friendly superpower to carry its own weight.  I don't lose anything by telling my friends they should be able to defend themselves.  I want friends and allies, not slaves entirely dependent on me for security.  A European should want the ability to defend himself and not be entirely relying on the whims of the US while an aggressive superpower is invading the country on his border.

You very much seem to think there are only two gears here, maximum force interventionism or total isolationist neutrality.  We can find a happy place between these where NATO remains strong and we keep a strong military without constantly meddling and being expected to pay for and provide everything needed for security.

Libertarian,comment,single market,g9bdrgt,DrugsForRobots,,"First, as Jeff Diest said, it's honestly more helpful and accurate to talk about **libertarian values**, instead of saying ""I am a libertarian"", precisely because of these gatekeeper types, and because the term is being adopted, coopted, and misused by a variety of people.

2nd, libertarian values are about personal liberty and private property, drawing on the theory of natural rights. It is from these that we get the NAP.

The people you're describing may have mostly libertarian values, though they seem confused about certain things. Libertarianism is opposed to the State (the people running the government) because such goverments are predicated on the use of violence and coercion to violate the rights of others. However, violence and coercion is legitimate in the defense of persons and property. I will come back to this.

It is possible to be in favor of the legalization of certain things (like drugs or prostitution, to use two common extremes by most people's standards, as examples) and be opposed to the widespread adoption and acceptance of those things. In other words, saying you're in favor of legalizing drugs and prostitution *is not the same thing as being an advocate of drugs or prostitution*. Another way of saying it: just because you oppose the use of violence and coercion by the State in these affairs (since they are the private choices of consenting individuals) **does not mean you want your society to be filled with drug users and prostitutes.**

That is probably their confusion. They want a socially conservative society, but have libertarian values when it comes to other things (like taxes and trade). There can be overlap between the two - social conservativism and economic liberalism are not mutually exclusive.

So you must ask your people if they are ultimately willing to use violence and coercion to exclude such people from society. If they are, they aren't libertarian. 

However, I will add, it is perfectly in alignment with libertarian values to exclude people or groups from private property. Hence, if you didnt want communists preaching on your property, you would be justified in removing them, as they were violating your property rights.",2020-10-19T12:09:02+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a high profile opposition leader organising protest, FSB was actively watching Nemtsov and knew about the goons, they likely shared the info of his movement.

It says the veto “gives tools to irresponsible politicians to destroy the union from within”.

>Its proposal has been criticised by the right-wing opposition, which says removing the veto would further reduce Poland’s sovereignty and empower Brussels to impose policies on the country.

>

>The Left announced the policy ahead of next month’s elections to the European Parliament, in which it will be standing separately from its coalition partners, the centrist Civic Coalition (KO) and centre-right Third Way (Trzecia Droga).

>It did so on 3 May, when Poland holds a public holiday to celebrate the anniversary of the adoption of the country’s constitution in 1791.

>That document – which is regarded as Europe’s first modern constitution and the world’s second, after the US constitution – removed the right of single nobles to veto laws.

Neoliberal,comment,imf,gr2g0v0,No-Serve-7580,,"Thanks for your reply. Just about the two points you raised there.

1. Why do I think we should put in the extra effort? Because I think workers and communities should be able to decide what's done with the wealth they create, and as you said these cooperatives could be viable with enough support. It's not gonna happen over night as you correctly pointed out, but when it does workers, communities and society as a whole will be better off.

2. The structural unemployment problem is an issue that market socialists have discussed before. There's two solutions for this problem. The first is a universal jobs program. The public sector in a market socialist society would probably be fairly large, since public sector work is fairly labour intensive this would require a significant amount of workers. As a result, this state would be able to guarantee anyone who wants a job a job. The other solution is universal basic income. I personally like Yanis Varoufakis' idea for a UBI. This would involve the Government owning a couple shares in all of the cooperatives and using these shares to provide a dividend to everyone in society. 

For the record I'm not against things like ESOP or codetermination, I think these are good steps in the right direction.",2021-03-15T23:44:41+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

This part focuses on TDE’s telling of the rise of the Bretton Woods system, the set of post-WW2 agreements and institutions that governed international finance.

As a structural matter, previous posts simply followed along with Dollar Endgame line by line, correcting each fact as we go. Instead, for this post, I’m going to try to briefly outline what the Bretton Woods system was and how it worked and then look at what The Dollar Endgame gets wrong. This is simply for reasons of clarity as I found the alternative structure difficult to follow.

**IV. The Rise of Bretton Woods**

Bretton Woods, at its simplest, was the replacement for the gold standard.

Why was the gold standard replaced? The Dollar Endgame argues that it was concern over the physical safety of gold. As we have seen in previous posts, this doesn’t make a great deal of sense.

Reductively, I think the actual cause can be made out to be three things.

First, the Gold Standard in the period between World War I and II performed atrociously. For a variety of reasons, governmental commitment to the gold standard after World War I was not perceived as credible and so capital flight and speculation generated tremendous instability.¹ ² A return to the gold standard was not in particularly high demand given recent historical experience with how frustrating it could be.

Second, economic technology and demands had shifted. A gold standard, by constraining the money creation abilities of a central bank (you need gold inflows to expand the money supply), necessarily constrains the central bank's capability to intervene in the domestic economy.³ Demonstrating why this is true, much to my deep regret, requires a brief discursion into macroeconomics.

There exists a fundamental trilemma where an economy can only select two of Pegged Exchange Rates, Free Flow of Capital, and Control of Domestic Monetary Policy (intermediate outcomes are also possible).

Why is this the case?

Consider a central bank that wants to raise a country's interest rates to tame inflation. If capital is allowed to move freely, it will flow into the country with higher interest rates. This increases demand for the country’s currency and thereby puts upward pressure on exchange rates. When you combine this with a currency peg, where relative values of currencies are not allowed to move, this becomes untenable, the government will quickly exhaust its ability to defend the currency peg. Thus, one of the three must be given up.

The gold standard selects pegged exchange rates and free flow of capital off the menu, sacrificing control of domestic monetary policy. This was no longer desirable in the postwar period for a couple of reasons. First, significant development in macroeconomic thought (i.e. the existence of John Maynard Keynes) shifted how important monetary policy was understood to be.

Additionally, at this time there had been significant expansion in the franchise and organization of labor that generated political demand for economic intervention and employment policy. This was not without historical precedent.⁴ Consider William Jennings Bryan’s objection that policymakers in the U.S. were “crucify\[ing\] mankind on a cross of gold” and that, specifically, “the gold standard has slain its tens of thousands”.⁵ Bryan specifically was in an earlier period and his movement was ultimately unsuccessful, but as institutions became more inclusive over the course of the 1900s, this latent pressure for control of monetary policy and these sorts of demands became harder to ignore.

Finally, as some countries shifted away from the gold standard, the incentive increased for additional countries to move away.⁶ A great deal of the benefits of the gold standard were because of its function as a coordination mechanism; the more countries using it, the higher the returns to being on it.⁷ A shift away by one or two implies key players implies an unraveling. Indeed, Sterlings depegging from gold in the interwar period could be understood to play basically this role.

Thus, the gold standard was out in favor of a new agreement. What was landed on (following the negotiations described in part 2) was Bretton Woods⁸. The main points, in brief, were:

1. The US would peg the dollar to gold
2. Every other country would peg their currency to the dollar
3. Dollars could be converted by certain actors into gold at the fixed rate
4. The IMF was created to provide liquidity if a country experienced a temporary balance of payments issue.
5. Countries were permitted to institute controls on the flow of capital.
6. This system selects for pegged exchange rates and control of domestic monetary policy, giving up on the free flow of capital.

So how does The Dollar Endgame describe Bretton Woods? It, I think, gets what it says mostly right, but doesn’t say nearly enough:

*At Bretton Woods, the consortium of nations assented to an agreement whereby the Dollar would become the WRC and the participating nations would synchronize monetary policy to avoid competitive devaluation. In summary, they could still redeem dollars for Gold at a fixed rate of $35 an oz, a hard redemption peg which the U.S would defend.*

*Thus they entered into a quasi- Gold standard, where citizens and private corporations could NOT redeem dollars for Gold (due to the Gold Reserve Act , c. 1934), but sovereign governments (Central banks) could still redeem dollars for gold. Since their currencies (like the Franc and Pound) were pegged to the Dollar, and the Dollar pegged to gold, all countries remained connected indirectly to a gold standard, stabilizing their currency conversion rate to each other and limiting local governments’ ability to print and spend recklessly.*

This largely covers what I described above, but I would point out, isn’t a complete description. Of course, this can somewhat be forgiven as a space constraint. After all, my description doesn’t describe every detail of the agreement either. But, I think it really is material to Bretton Woods to understand that there was more going than just currency pegging. The peg, as we will discuss below, presented serious issues and the creators of the agreement anticipated a large amount of these and made an effort to prevent them with a bevy of international institutions, many of which persist to this day. When you describe Bretton Woods without including the creation of adjustment mechanism and allowances for capital controls, it very much makes it seem like the later problems weren’t anticipated. They very much were and attempts were made to prevent them.

Another critique I would make is that “Agreement where the Dollar would become the \[World Reserve Currency\]” doesn’t seem quite right. The dollars status as a source of international reserves and as the denominator of trade was:

1. Downstream of US economic dominance and Bretton Woods, but not legally entailed by the agreement.
2. Functionally already the case from the 20s.⁹

https://preview.redd.it/he5z3hf0m0tb1.png?width=336&format=png&auto=webp&s=44da56705345ed1a5e34e8bb559d84ae7a650789

Also, I find the last line of this pitch, that Bretton Woods limited “governments’ ability to print” confusing. The premise of Bretton Woods was that it would allow more domestic intervention in the money supply, not less! We just went over how it shifted the trilemma away from flow of capital and towards control of the domestic money supply. Of course, there were limits on how the system could interact with inflation, but in general the US Federal Reserve was able to intervene in monetary policy without paying too much attention to international concerns.¹⁰

Lastly, without taking too much of a cheapshot, the citations here border on nonsensical. The first link is to a corporate training company’s clickfarm article incorrectly describing Bretton Woods. The second link, regarding nations synchronizing monetary policy, links to a 70’s paper arguing that the US, Japan, and Germany ought to collaborate on a new international money standard based on their 3 currencies. The third link, which is supposed to be evidence the US defending the gold peg is a discussion of the history of the US and gold that only discuses Bretton Woods on one singular line (which to be fair, does mention pegging gold prices) and is far too general and loose in its description.

From here, we get a brief paragraph about the decade and a bit that Bretton Woods was in successful operation:

*For a few decades, this system worked well enough. US economic growth spurred European rebuilding, and world trade continued to increase. Cracks started to appear during the Guns and Butter era of the 1960’s, when Vietnam War spending and Johnson’s Great Society programs spurred a new era of fiscal profligacy. The US started borrowing massively, and dollars in the form of Treasuries started stacking up in foreign Central Banks reserve accounts.*

Once again, I have several issues here. First, the idea that US economic growth spurred European rebuilding is very much incomplete.

Pause and really disentangle that idea. What, analytically, would have been different for a European economy with a very low stock of capital if the US had maintained the exact same GDP per capita across the 1950’s? That is, if the US economy had remained stagnant with no growth.

https://preview.redd.it/02do30pwl0tb1.png?width=2638&format=png&auto=webp&s=83989f9ef0d8ed75540fb9f38580e7791f71af56

Presumably imports from the US would have been a bit more expensive - and imports from the US absolutely were important - but what seems to be the important driver here is not the US’s growth rate, but the level of overall difference with Europe. That is, the main contribution of the US was not that it was growing, but that it already existed and was massive.

Another critique I might make of the above is that it actively undersells the US’s assistance to Europe. We were not just passive observers incidentally aiding through free market trade, but deliberately involved ourself in rebuilding.

Immediately after World War II, several things were true:

1. European countries were rapidly incurring debt denominated in US dollars to finance rebuilding.
2. European suppliers of goods and services has decreased, furthering US dependence and the dollar deficit
3. Servicing dollar denominated debts requires acquiring US dollars

The function of the above was to create a very high demand for dollars in Europe while at the same time the US willingness to supply dollars had shifted downwards (as high tariffs + few european import goods lowered demand for European currency).¹¹ This in itself isn’t particularly problematic, in a free market the value of the dollar with shift to equilibriate demand with supply. However, the premise of Bretton Woods is to fix the price of currencies against one another. Thus, as you might expect when you have demand and supply shifts as well as an effective price ceiling, a shortage arose.

European nations experienced an acute shortage of dollars until about 1952.

Policymakers did three things to relieve this.

First, and perhaps most importantly, the Marshall plan. The United States transferred about 12 billion in funds, a majority of it grants, to Europe. This, for one, helped relieve the dollar shortage, but also, obviously, helped Europe rebuild. Thus, the US went above and beyond just indirectly helping Europe by growing its economy, it really did just transfer resources over.

Second, several European countries devalued their currency against the dollar, raising the price ceiling.

Third, European countries reduced the demand for dollars by engaging in a series of intra-european trade agreements to reduce reliance on U.S. exports. Interestingly, U.S. policymakers largely tolerated asymmetrically high European tariffs, presumably in recognition of the dollar shortage issue (though I don’t know that for certain).

This, in sum, was a very deliberate government managed effort to ensure that US economic power was available to European countries. The channel was much more complex than Growth -> Rebuilding.

Let us now move to the claims that *“Cracks started to appear during the Guns and Butter era of the 1960’s, …The US started borrowing massively, and dollars in the form of Treasuries started stacking up in foreign Central Banks reserve accounts.”*

The federal debt did increase during the LBJ presidency, but a few things are worth caveating. First, it's unclear that this is a meaningful inflection point. U.S. total external dollar liabilities first exceeded U.S. gold stocks in the 50’s. U.S. obligations to foreign central banks, specifically, first exceeded gold stocks before 1965 and that’s without counting eurodollar deposits. If you include those, obligations to central banks exceeded gold stocks by 1963.¹²

https://preview.redd.it/l2hk2k96m0tb1.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5f85d0c709dd8b6457fea8a28a8bb7b3194811b

A eurodollar, by the way, is essentially a US dollar denominated deposit held at a non-US Bank. There will be more discussion on this in future parts, but one other thing worth mentioning, is, per the graph above, these sorts of holdings actually constituted a larger fraction of central bank claims on dollars than treasuries did, contra their implied importance in the claim that *“The US started borrowing massively, and dollars in the form of* ***Treasuries*** *started stacking up in foreign Central Banks reserve accounts.”*

So where does this leave us? Bretton Woods was a historical response to gold standard and evolving political demands that created a variety of institutions designed to stabilize monetary policy while facilitating an international exchange rate. It experienced a variety of growing pains (the dollar shortage listed here as well as non discussed currency convertibility issues). As these issues resolved, the liabilities of the US, theoretically exchangeable for gold, began to exceed actual gold supplies. Functionally, this begins to resemble the sort of arrangement vulnerable to bank runs and indeed would somewhat experience one in the 70s, which we will discuss next time.

Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) voted no. Merkley had voted with Democrats to advance the bill on earlier procedural votes. 

Democratic and Republican senators who voted to advance the measure hope strong bipartisan support will give it enough political momentum to spur Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) to bring it to the House floor. Johnson, however, fired a warning shot on Monday just minutes before the Senate kicked off its first vote, slamming the bill for its lack of border provisions.

“[I]n the absence of having received any single border policy change from the Senate, the House will have to continue to work its own will on these important matters,” Johnson wrote. “America deserves better than the Senate’s status quo.”

Many Republican senators who voted against advancing money for Ukraine and Israel said they wanted a chance to amendment package with stronger border security reforms.

A small group of senators offered more than 80 amendments to the bill, prompting some of their colleagues to accuse them of trying to use the amendment process to derail it.

After haggling on Friday and over the weekend, senators failed to reach an agreement on voting on amendments.

The Senate is expected to vote on final passage of the legislation either Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on whether conservatives insist on using all 30 hours of debate at their disposal.",2024-02-13T03:20:27+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

Members of the transition council sent their plan to the regional Caribbean body CARICOM late Sunday.

The accord establishes a nine-member council — seven voting members and two observers — representing political parties, the private sector and civil society, that will pave the way for presidential elections by early 2026.

Its mandate ""will end on February 7, 2026,"" according to the agreement seen Monday by AFP.

A final step awaits: the formal approval and acceptance of the deal by Haiti's outgoing government.

The council's first task will be to elect a prime minister who, in collaboration with the nine-member team, will form a government charged with leading the country until ""democratic, free and credible elections"" can be held, the agreement states.

No members of the council or the soon-to-be-formed government will be allowed to run in the elections.

The transitional body establishes priorities or ""security, constitutional and institutional reforms, and elections.""

Neoliberal,comment,rejoin eu,jsfmwte,ldn6,,"> More than half of Britons would vote to rejoin the European Union for the first time since the nation opted to leave the bloc seven years ago, YouGov polling showed. Some 51% of Britons told the polling company that they would vote for the UK to become an EU member again, while 32% said they’d stay out, according to the survey conducted last week. The proportion in favor of rejoining has risen 11 points since January 2021, when Brexit formally took place.

> The findings reflect growing disillusionment among British voters about Brexit, which triggered years of divisive debate in Parliament before the UK finally left the bloc. Britons are yet to see the promised fruits of departure from the EU, with UK holidaymakers facing longer queues at European airports and shoppers facing higher food prices fueled by both Brexit curbs on migrant workers and its effect on supply chains. A trade deal with the US, meanwhile, held as one of the great prizes of Brexit, doesn’t look likely to materialize anytime soon.

> Seven years on from the referendum, the UK remains in a cost-of-living crisis with inflation outstripping price rises elsewhere in Europe. Meanwhile, many regions which voted for Brexit are more likely to face a widening wealth and opportunity gap relative to richer parts of the UK, according to Bloomberg analysis earlier this year. Some 57% of Britons told YouGov the UK was wrong to vote for Brexit in 2016, the highest figure the polling firm has recorded. One in five Britons who voted to leave the EU in 2016 now say it was the wrong decision.

> Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has repeatedly said he believes in Brexit and the opportunities it presents, but his government is nevertheless seeking to renegotiate parts of the UK’s exit deal that it fears will cause disruption and added costs to businesses and consumers. UK officials are currently in talks with their EU counterparts to delay upcoming tariffs on electric vehicles shipped between the UK and the EU and the government is also weighing options to limit the cost of post-Brexit border checks on European food imports due to start in the next six months. In April, Bloomberg reported that Sunak also hopes to reach an agreement to let Britons use EU e-gates for passport checks, another friction point for tourists and business travelers since Brexit.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,european,ggyp1yv,Nootherids,,"Well put. It is often so hard for anybody to point out the generational disadvantage that black Americans have because the moment you say anything that could come off as disparaging you get called a racist. But I think this position in the hierarchy of generational evolution is probably one of the most important aspects to focus on to better the conditions of minority communities. If we keep placing blame externally then it is only exacerbating the lack of generational knowledge. 

Every single community in existence has had to develop their own strengths and overcome adversities to achieve their own level of progress. Never have any of these communities bern elevated as a whole by outsiders. As you stated, most communities have hundreds or even thousands of years achieving this. But black Americans have an extremely shallow history. And so much has changed in such a short time. Coincidentally though, it is debatable that in the early years of their freedom to thrive on their own merit against overwhelming adversity they progressed exponentially. Yet once this progress started being influenced by externalities, namely government programs, this progress by most statistically quantifiable measures has regrettably regressed to unacceptable levels.

Everything I just said would typically just be brushed away as purely racist. But this is coming from the perspective of a Hispanic whose people are still relatively oppressed by codified federal law, yet instead of dwelling on the limits or benefits presented to us we just figure out what we can do for ourselves given our situations. My people are faaaaaar from being a fully self-sufficient highly successful people. Our history is also limited. But we do not focus on externalities to create progress for us and we do not try as hard as we can to rush the process.

Generational progress takes....generations. And this need to achieve massive changes in a matter of a single presidential term might actually be a bigger source for detriment than for repeatable progress.",2020-12-25T04:42:16+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,
PoliticalDiscussion,comment,european,gr3hcyw,nannerooni,,"I think that the distinction between legal and illegal immigration is just a distraction from what all these conversations are really about. Legality changes constantly, especially with immigration. Of course, everyone wants people to do things legally. But when that can change when a migrant is en-route and they can be denied, what are we really talking about here? Legal immigration is also barely even an option sometimes, and going through the system perfectly is absolutely no guarantee that you will succeed, especially when ICE has to follow laws specifically designed to make legit success difficult.

When people say they support legal immigration, they wouldn’t necessarily support legally open borders. Everyone has a set of values so that if the law didn’t match up to them, they would be mad.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,european,i26sca5,Sure-Sea2982,,"It is not for Russia to make demands of anyone. Dombass is Ukrainian, as is Crimea. Putin may bitch and whine to Russian people about NATO but he knows it is a defensive alliance that poses no threat to Russia or anyone else for that matter. The current bloodshed is all on him and his insatiable greed for oil and gas belonging to a neighbouring country, nothing else. Such a shame that a country like Russia with such abundant natural resources has been pillaged by years of corrupt and incompetent leadership. You could and should be living in paradise rather than a brutalist authoritarian state where life is cheap and your future so uncertain. 

  
In terms of Putin spitting out his dummy on NATO membership for Ukraine, what shocking arrogance. His impotent ramblings speak more to his own insecurities than any sense of reality. Frankly Putin has no say in what any free country decides to do on this regard. Any country wishing to join NATO can do so with or without Putin’s blessing. It is enshrined in the founding articles of the NATO treaty which has not changed since 1949. 

  
Please remember that Putin himself wanted Russia to join NATO. He was very clear that the security that membership provided would make Russia rich and prosperous. He was right, that is exactly what it would have done for Russia. Back in 2000 he stated publicly that he ‘cannot imagine my own country in isolation from Europe and what we often call the civilised world’ Sadly corruption, impatience and his growing inferiority complex got the better of him and your country is the mess it is today.

  
There is no hiding from the needless slaughter this war has caused on both sides. There is no hiding from the corruption that is endemic in the Russian military machine. There is no hiding from the war crimes being committed in Putin’s name. This tragic folly of his has undone years of scheming and machinations, strengthened the resolve of NATO and undermined future oil and gas sales from Russia. 

  
It is difficult to overstate just how badly Putin miscalculated his war on Ukraine and the long term damage that he has caused to his county’s prosperity and credibility on the world stage.",2022-03-26T13:07:27+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

M5S isn't too well-known outside of Italy.

In general M5S hasn't attracted much broader attention, maybe because it doesn't fit in with the strong anti-immigrant populist trend seen with Le Pen, Wilders, AfD, etc. Or maybe it is because Italian politics are a bit of a mystery to us non-Italians due to the unusually high number of political parties.",2016-12-06T06:07:10+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,single market,cgmehtz,ASniffInTheWind,,"> The federal government largely depends on income taxes. State governments largely depend on sales taxes 

This is incorrect. The largest revenue source for state governments is transfers from the federal government, next is property tax and finally is sales tax (with income tax a very close fourth). This varies wildly though, states like New Hampshire have no income or sales tax components while states like New York income is their largest revenue source.

> And why is it that so many local projects depend on taxes paid to the federal government and then doled back out as grants?

Its a way of the federal government accomplishing tasks they would otherwise be constitutionally restricted from doing. If you want to make sure all states have seat belt laws, mandatory auto insurance and consistent speed limits then you tie these things to highway funding.

Other programs its down to scaling. Medicaid simply wouldn't work if it wasn't a state administered program, its already a problem in larger states due to the size & scope of the program and if it was federally administered then it simply wouldn't function at all.

For other programs its also about regional differences in need & demand. Vermont & New Hampshire have extremely low poverty rates and as such simply don't need the same level of public services provided as California & New Mexico. A federal one size fits all approach would reduce the quality of services provided everywhere as it would be a national solution to regional problems with a great degree of variance. For a good example of this take a look at how different states handle TANF, everything from qualification requirements to lifetime maximums changes fairly radically between states as they have tailored their state program for their population.

This federal oversight with state administration is something that we should see more of and even bills like ACA transform a federally run system in to a state run system with federal oversight & funding.

> and the richest (supposedly highest taxed) continued making big gains.

In terms of loss of income recessions always hurt those with larger incomes to a much greater degree, when a large portion of your income is from investment sources and those investments have large negative yields then you take extremely significant losses on AGI as a result.

The correct way to consider this is that low-income individuals entered a period of static income with an increase in unemployment, unemployment declines with income fairly linearly while loss of income increases exponentially with income.

> but a lot of consumption is inelastic

Consumption is not inelastic, where did you get this absurd notion from? If consumption was inelastic then we wouldn't have a business cycle at all.

> Property prices in a large number of markets, on the other hand, tanked epically. Huge percentages of the taxable values of housing stocks were wiped out, and an epidemic of foreclosures and vacant properties also ensued.

The market readjusted to its non-artificial price point. Home-ownership rates in the US are far higher then they should be and as an asset class housing is hugely inflated, both of these are down to federal housing policy. The relative volatility in the US housing market is a beast of our own creation.

> So I ask myself (and Reddit): is there a good reason why local, state, and federal budgets should face different conditions as the economy changes or faces a crisis? 

It would be an impossibility to do so. How could you justify taxing someone in NH the same as someone in NM when the person in NH has fewer services available to them? How would you deal with regional variances in performance? The recession was very much a regional issue; New England and the Dakotas recovered extremely quickly and in many cases had fairly limited problems in the first place while other states had vast problems.

In addition the issue was less about municipalities struggling and more about them acting fiscally irresponsibly before the recession. The correct spending mechanism across the business cycle is to take on debt during a dip to sustain government services in the absence of revenue while running a surplus during a boom such that over a cycle the municipal budget is balanced. Municipalities who did this really didn't suffer recessionary problems as they had access to credit sources to sustain them during a cyclic revenue glut, states that ran huge deficits during the boom entered the recession unable to source sufficient credit to sustain spending through it.

The solution is to force municipalities to behave responsibly not to penalize those who do.

> Was there something about the Credit Crunch / Great Recession crisis that meant that it should have placed more pressure on school budgets than on our national parks? 

National Parks have relatively fixed budgets and don't crow faster then inflation. Education budgets do.

All spending should be subject to a critical eye, making a value statement regarding education vs national parks sounds good but ignores that one budget is relatively healthy while one has spiraling costs unrelated to performance.

> When there's a housing bubble, is there a reason that should a (temporary) windfall for fixing potholes but not for fixing Aegis destroyers?

Fixing potholes has a much higher multiplier then fixing destroyers.

> Yes, amending constitutions and charters is hard. But from a practical standpoint, what would be wrong with doing it this way? 

It ignores evidence from the rest of the world in regards to centralization vs regionalization, higher performance systems are always those with smallest possible population base.

Scandinavian countries are a good example of this. Central government doesn't generally run any services, they have a relatively small revenue base they use for services that need to be centralized (defense etc) and for administration but otherwise they simply mandate what regional governments must offer in terms of services and leave it up to them to provision those services and collect revenue to support them. The central governments role here is to ensure the regional programs are running correctly and transfer capital from wealthy regions to poorer regions so those poorer regions can afford to maintain minimum standards of service.

Other countries (see Singapore) take it even further with a system population base of 1, systems are individualized such that individuals source what they need directly with a subsidy applied to consumption to deal with the wealth transfer.

We should be going in precisely the opposite direction to what you are advocating for, the federal government should be mandating what states offer but leaving it to them to source most of the revenue for these programs.

Ukraine didn't need to be pressured to walk away from anything given they've been fighting Russia's annexation for eight years, and if there's one thing Putin's demonstrated it's that he *pathologically* acts in bad faith; assuming any negotiation would be honored is quite literally ""Fool me once"".

Russia already physically controlled controlled Crimea; why, after Russia's unprovoked invasion and *endless* litany of war crimes, when Ukraine is *on the offensive,* should they accede to the *status quo ante*? You should also educate yourself a little before parroting the aggressor's talking points; Azov was already ""deNazified"" when they were officially folded into Ukraine's military.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,uk,jyrlq6w,PresidentPineSol,,"That whole argument is entirely circular.    
     
Biden's not for something because he doesn't have a mandate to do it.   
He doesn't have a mandate to do it because he literally campaigned against doing it.    
He campaigned against doing it because he wasn't for it to begin with.   
     
All of these pragmatic and process concerns seem to be side-stepping the issue of Biden's actual stated position. He's in favor of the for-profit insurance and healthcare system, which is a dysfunctional disaster that is not serving Americans well.     
      
The idea that a for-profit healthcare industry will ever leave more money in patients' pockets is as ludicrous as the idea that more guns will reduce gun violence. It's reality-denying insanity that makes it sound like Joe Biden doesn't even grasp the problem much less give a shit about fixing it.  
     
The GOP doesn't push tax cuts for the rich because it appeals to voters in Ohio, they actively convince those voters that tax cuts for the rich are good. Democrats need to spend more time selling progressive policies, and less time trying to convince their own voters that progressive policies are un-passable. 
    
I would love to see a Democrat go out, look John Q. West Virginia Voter in the eye and say ""Yes, I support Medicare for All. Because if you pay a $600 insurance premium every month, you shouldn't have to pay a $10,000 deductible, and you shouldn't have the care you need denied, and you shouldn't be taken advantage of for profit when you're sick. It's wrong. And it happens every day in this country, and only in this country. And even if you are happy with the healthcare you get, too many Americans' lives are ruined by this system. It's wrong, and I'm gonna fight to change it, because every American deserves healthcare without risk of bankruptcy.""    
   
John Q. might not agree, but I think he and a lot of voters would respect a frank acknowledgement of a problem and will to do something about it. That's what Joe Biden is missing, in my assessment. And he seems all the less serious when he instead says disingenuous and dismissive things like ""people *love* their private health insurance!"" or ""it'll cost twice the entire federal budget!""",2023-09-02T04:24:59+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,ukip,d8be8q0,pimanac,,"> It's quite simple really. As the final result is 51.89% to 48.11% all you have to do is declare that this is NOT nearly a statement of consensus strong enough to bind so momentous a choice to.

That sets very dangerous precedents.  You're literally saying ""Even though we set up this referendum to pass with a simple majority (50% + 1),  51.89% clearly isn't a statement of consensus"".

There are close votes all the time and just because this one has evoked a lot of emotions and passion on both sides doesn't mean that it's ""tyranny of the majority"".  The referendum was set up in such a way that it would be decided by a simple majority.  I'm not overly familiar with British referendum law but could they not have required the referendum need a much higher percentage of support?  

I know it's technically a ""non-binding"" referendum but the average voter doesn't give a shit about that.  When you've got the entire country all up in arms over this vote vote on both sides for months and MPs are talking about it like its the best thing/end of the word and the news is doing expose and analysis 24/7...people the average voter isn't really gonna care about ""non-binding"" part.  

They're going to care that they went to the polls and cast a vote on what the politicians are telling them is one of the biggest issues facing Britain in a generation.  If this had gone the other way - I truly believe that the Remain camp would not be making the argument that 51.89% wan't consensus.  The whole thing stinks like sore loser on behalf of the Remain side to me.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,ukip,ihjhi29,illegalmorality,,"Economic inequality caused by globalization. Sure, globalization created a global drop in prices all around, but it also caused a reduction in quality of work by shutting down manufacturing jobs domestically. And while most of those Americans could move on to other industries to find work, much of the work wasn't as high quality as before, and that alongside the government's failures to enact social programs to serve as a safety net for those who needed it, lead to contempt in the current system. 

The ""going back to the way things were before"", whether these conservatives realize it or not, comes from a place where globalized shifting markets has failed them (particularly rural areas that relied heavily on these industries). In which case; the solution should be to create social programs such as UBI, or tariff tax returns so that citizens can *feel* the benefits of globalization, instead of being told its good without actually feeling the benefits to it.",2022-07-25T04:59:00+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

And not just scams in that sense either, but the exponential flooding of misinformation that will be “backed up” by videos that appear to the untrained eye as completely real will be just enough to further sew hate and anger much like we’re experiencing right now. I dont have any faith that people will be diligent in seeking out the truth, especially if they see something fake that looks real enough that aligns to their ideology and opinions. I dont think there can be a healthy amount of skepticism when people are so quick to weaponize false information and refuse to accept that it’s fake. 

And with Tik tok being banned, this article about the senate going after deep fakes can’t be a coincidence. Tik tok would have been a powerful powerful tool to spread propaganda at all levels using Deep fakes because the rate that the average person scrolls through the videos, there’s a higher chance they won’t look for details to see if it’s fake or not. They’ll just remember vaguely seeing a face and whatever is said and keep scrolling along. And then it’ll be paraphrased over and over again until enough people will think that the fake video was true which would probably be enough to sway the younger generation of voters in some way. I really wish educating people on being informed on what’s true and what’s not was enough but sadly I’ve seen no evidence of people around my age and younger’s ability to not be morons, myself included, so I think Pandora’s box is open and the only thing we can do is work diligently to keep advancing software to combat scams and misinformation that keeps up with the growth of ai cause if not then we’re fucked for real. 
And just “banning deep fakes” would do absolutely nothing to stop it now. It wouldn’t even stop people in the US from torrenting jt easily and it sure as hell wouldn’t stop a non us company from developing and improving upon it for the foreseeable future. The cats out of the bag on this one unfortunately and it will used for much worse things than fake celebrity pornos lol. 

Sorry for ranting and I am not completely against AI because of the potential to do great things with the help of AI but this is one of the consequences it’s going to bring along with it unfortunately. I really hope that I’m wrong and we can all mark my comment down as a paranoid rambling but we should be teaching this in schools more diligently than when I was taught about email scams in school.

In theory, American dominance here is balanced by European dominance in the IMF, whose head is traditionally (always) European.

This doesn't remove the asylum process, it just puts some requirements: they need to show up at a real port, not just cross the border *wherever*, and they need to undergo a quick interview at the border to ask *why* they're crossing - potentially disqualifying them from asylum if its not for a reason that is legally allowed (economic asylum, for instance).  It also tries to reduce the wait time before an asylum seeker has their immigrations trial, but provides funds for whatever municipality they end up in so that some random city isn't left holding the bill for their room and board.

>A report in May 2008 by the Congressional Research Service found ""strong indication"" that illegal border-crossers had simply found new routes.[16] New York Times op-ed writer Lawrence Downes wrote in 2013: ""A climber with a rope can hop it in less than half a minute. ... Smugglers with jackhammers tunnel under it. They throw drugs and rocks over it. The fence is breached not just by sunlight and shadows, but also the hooded gaze of drug-cartel lookouts, and by bullets. Border agents describe their job as an unending battle of wits, a cat-mouse game with the constant threat of violence.""[12][17]

>As of 2016, fence was routinely climbed or otherwise circumvented.[12] A 2017 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, citing U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data, found that from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2015, the U.S.-Mexico border fence had been breached 9,287 times, at an average cost of $784 per breach to repair.[18] The GAO reported in 2017 that both pedestrian and vehicle barriers have been defeated by various methods, including using ramps to drive vehicles ""up and over"" vehicle fencing in the sector; scaling, jumping over, or breaching pedestrian fencing; burrowing or tunneling underground; and even using small aircraft.[20]

and this part was funny:

>A 2019 National Bureau of Economic Research paper by Dartmouth College and Stanford University economists found that the ""total impact of the border wall expansion including all general equilibrium adjustments was to reduce the (long-run) number of Mexican workers residing in the United States by about 50,000, a decline of approximately 0.4%.""[21]",2024-02-27T18:35:28+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

[ZelefantPlaysMC](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZelefantPlaysMC/)  [pigpaydirt](https://www.reddit.com/user/pigpaydirt/)   I think another issue at hand is that Trump was discussing the idea of being able to identify regions of the country and segments of the population are most at risk and devising ways to keep them sufficiently isolated without having as nation of 300 million people on lockdown.  Trump knows that having 300 million people barred from going out in any meaningful sense simply doesn't count as a long term strategy.  It's a temporary way to get time to find actual methods to stop it from growing too quickly.  Being able to use available info at hand to determine which sections of the country can reopen and which demographics can get back to work is fundamentally different from saying that by Easter it will have become a mildly bad cold.",2020-03-28T08:45:42+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

http://www.wsj.com/articles/tenor-of-campaign-takes-a-toll-poll-finds-1457499603

Granted the source is a thing, but it boils down to a difference of opinion on who would win the general vs primary.  Granted you have to win the primary first, so that is a factor but the more things happen, the more I see this getting pushed to a brokered convention.  And while everyone would rather avoid that it does seem to be a path. So...

> You're obligated to keep trying to do the best you can every day

Therefore, I will keep supporting him as long as he chooses to stay in.  He's a pragmatist and an excellent political tactician, so I trust him to decide when its time to withdraw. But to be frank I've tired of ""holding my nose"" nearly as much as conservatives have and just want someone honest who will work with the legislative branch instead of against it.  (no one will deny Cruz's relationship with congress is.... strained? is that the best word?

Additionally, from my interaction with them (no polls to back this up just experience), its more likely that Kasich supporter will either jump ship towards trump or the dems than towards Cruz.  They're not fans of his religious rhetoric (their words), his view of gay marriage, his slash and burn plan for the ACA (they want a real replacement), or his willingness to use executive powers to the degree he is suggesting. Just read the comments of that [screed I posted a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/KasichForPresident/comments/3nl8uj/someone_asked_me_why_i_support_kasich_heres_my/) if you doubt this.  I am not overstating, that many on Kasich's side of the fence don't even list Cruz as their fifth pick.  For instance mine starting out was Kasich>Paul>Christie>Bush>Rubio.  My list has obviously updated (Kasich>Cruz = Rubio>write in Paul, huntsman in protest) but that is the kind of supporter we are talking about.  So it may in fact, be a good thing he stays in to steal votes from trump more so than Cruz.

Only recently, I have come to the conclusion that a Kasich/Cruz ticket would work out best as it would not only unite the republican party (conservatives and moderates) but it would garner a far larger pool than Kasich/Rubio ticket on a national level.  It would have to be a Kasich Cruz in that order in order to steal the number of votes needed from the dems though.  As a Cruz first ticket would solidify the liberal base.

Unfortunately, just as you are certain that Kasich needs to drop out and likely wont until its too late ""for the good of the party"", I am certain Cruz would never consider being Kasich's VP for the same reasons.",2016-03-11T14:53:53+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

Republican,post,uk,vm2f4p,yellowswan8,"The left often compares abortion bans to the handmaid's tale yet they actually advocate for something far closer, comercial surrogacy","The left often compares abortion bans to the handmaid's tale. A show where women are forced to have babies for elite families. This is a completely stupid argument as a women should know and has consented to the risk of pregnancy when she has had sex. However the left actually advocates something far closer to the handmaid's tale than this; commercial surrogacy. Take a look at the picture attached and also found in this article[https://www.newsweek.com/maternity-shoot-surrogate-mother-compared-handmaids-tale-1719352](https://www.newsweek.com/maternity-shoot-surrogate-mother-compared-handmaids-tale-1719352). The mother of the baby is being forced to stand a long way back and forced to hide her face because she's not important, just the ""parents."" She even has the red dress, all she needs is the bonnet.

You might say but she has chosen to do this. Yes, to an extent. But why has she chosen to do it? Because she is desparate and struggling financially. It is just exploitation. But do the men in this photo care, no. This is exacerbating class just like the handmaid's tale. Also imagine this situation; an 18 year old from a poor family being pressured by her parents into becomming a surrogate as they need money when she wants to go to college. Can you really say this girl has made a choice? I don't think this is hard to imagine, in fact I'd be willing to bet cases like this actually happen. And do you think those men in the pic care why the women is doing this? No of course they don't. They just want to use her and to have their baby. They use eggs from another women to prevent the risk of bonding and to make sure she won't change her mind. This is what is treating women like objects and cattle. Yet somehow ""feminists"" are supportive of this and angry about a ban on murdering babies? Which of these is closer to the handmaid's tale

Also, think about the situation before with the 18 year old. This is so similar to an 18 year old who is already pregnant being pressured to kill her baby. Which pro choicers do all the time.

I've read a lot of articles about surrogacy and rarely have i seen the parents actually caring about the surrogate. Sometimes they don't even mention her. To see the extent they view women as objects and care so little look at this article about surrogacy in Ukraine from the uk titled ""Ukraine: Impossible choices for surrogate mothers and parents"" [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60824936](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60824936). Here is an extract

""If the baby is born in a third country there are even more legal complications. And that's left Svetlana, Emma and Alex with a dilemma.

Surrogacy is not permitted in Moldova. If the baby is born there, Svetlana will be its legal guardian. She could place it for adoption but then it could be years before Emma and Alex are allowed to take their child home.

So together they have come up with a plan for Svetlana to deliver the baby in a city close to the border.

Svetlana has mixed feelings about going back to Ukraine. ""There's shooting everywhere, homes are being reduced to rubble and the Russians are shelling maternity hospitals, kindergartens and schools,"" she says.""

To summarize the parents are asking ""Do I coerce a vulnerable pregnant woman into returning to a warzone to sort a legal issue?"" Hmm, impossible questions eh?

Yet feminists are somehow okay with vulnerable women being exploited and treated like objects, but not okay with a ban on women murdering their children? It's so crazy and hypocritical

If a government had no debt, it wouldn't issue currency.  This would be an ideal situation. Most economists say that currency is a commodity and I am inclined to agree with them.  

Ideally, private businesses and individuals would issue their own currency that would compete on the free market.  This already happens to an extent in the form of gold and silver bullion, crypto currency etc.  

If we took away the ability of government to have a monopoly on currency then they would never have been able to bail out the banks, or print money destroying the purchasing power of our savings.  

We could then choose which commodities or currencies we invested our capital into without the government having any control over it.

However her attitude, her threatening to resign if her preferred candidate was not selected to stand at the next election - despite him failing vetting has completely put me off her, she has lost integrity in my eyes.

With that plus other broader issues with the SNP  I genuinely for the first time feel at a loss and don’t know who to vote for. I’m getting more aligned with that old adage “they’re all arseholes”. Obviously, obviously, I won’t be voting Tory, but apart from that I don’t know. I’ll probably need to look at local candidates and their policies and make a decision based on local levels I guess.",2024-02-08T04:18:02+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

The post-2014 vote was a very different beast. Many people who had backed them in 2011 and even before did not follow them into the new coalition (many of those ending up instead powering the Ruth Davidson-led Tory revival), while many who had never voted SNP before became their new bedrock of support.

Why not have confidence that if you explained it properly, with full numbers and a detailed plan, that you could convince people that the pain was worth it?

Aye, the SNP are bog standard politicians, but it's a bigger problem for your political party if they can't even compete with that. The bullshit they've attempted with fumbling funds, they'll be held accountable for.

No one thinks the light shines out of the SNP's arse unless they're extreme and no one really take people like that seriously; but they're still a hell of a lot better than whatever their competition can muster.

The SNP, as serving the people of Scotland, have done more than labour have; baby boxes, child payments, prescriptions, protecting us against the bedroom tax, protecting us from other things that have come up from Westminster to harm the most vulnerable in society.

What have labour done this last decade that hasn't been u-turned on or not delivered?

How's that vow from labour and the other tories turned out? A promise of more devolved powers (permanent and extensive, I believe they said), Scotland would lead the UK, no rise in energy prices, pensions safe, etc. 

Since that promise the supreme court has highlighted that English politicians can veto even devolved issues, following indy they outright attempted to ignore Scottish politicians, the prices in Scotland raised higher and faster than in England, they couldn't pay pensions because they had no money and yet could afford to decorate several literal palaces.

The SNP are clearly better than labour; labour can't even stay on their own promises and we've caught them in bed with the tories far too often.

It fills my heart with joy at the prospect of the right finally splintering into pieces and being out of power for decades.

I do hope the Tories face the worst nightmare scenario possible and end up with just a handful of seats.

Of course what replaces them will be several extreme parties similar to Trump's MAGA GOP in the US. We will have real bonkers nut jobs appealing to the crazy fascists -a MEGA cult ""Make ENGLAND Great Again"" will rise.

Scotland,comment,referendum,jl560u2,Audioboxer87,,"Yeah, as I alluded to above, even the 2014 result wouldn't have been enforceable from Scotland's POV. Westminster is soverign, even with the transfer of powers to hold a referendum, it was not legally binding and ultimately a YES vote in said referendum still required Westminster to pass legislation to grant Scotland soverignty.

Now, don't get me wrong, even if the result was 51% YES (what the Vow crew last minute shat the bed over), you'd still have expected the pig fucker to follow through (or more his government as he'd likely have resigned had we been sensible enough to vote YES). But that doesn't mitigate the fact the result was not *enforceable*, termination of this ""relationship"" due to the way the act of Union 1707 was setup and how flawed devolution is requires Westminster to act of its own choosing. We cannot walk when we want to walk, hence all the jokes about an abused partner locked in a house.

So all the bed wetting over parties running on a defacto referendum here are rather pointless. Unionists/Unionism owns Scotland, no matter how we vote we only get permission to leave when English MPs say so. But unless you want to go full Braveheart all the people here have to express their views *is* democracy, and a defacto referendum is a perfectly suitable way to challenge anti-democratic Unionism.

Wales,post,uk,12mbgf2,Curious-Bass3673,"""Who's paying for Skyline?"" Swansea Council Allocates £8.4M","""Swansea Council Allocates £8.4M to Skyline Luge Project in February 2023.""

In a meeting held on February 16, 2023, Swansea Council decided to allocate £8.4 million to the Skyline Luge project, despite earlier declarations by Rob Stewart, December 2022, head of Swansea Council, that no public money would be given to the project.

Link to evidence: [https://democracy.swansea.gov.uk/documents/s90090/11%20-%20Appendix%20C.pdf?LLL=0](https://democracy.swansea.gov.uk/documents/s90090/11%20-%20Appendix%20C.pdf?LLL=0)

Swansea Council's funding for the Skyline project is allocated as follows:

2022/23: £430,000

2023/24: £3,870,000

2024/25: £2,600,000

2025/26: £1,500,000

The decision to allocate funds to the Skyline Luge project has raised concerns about the council's priorities, particularly given the financial challenges many in the community face. With kids, nurses, and teachers relying on food banks and bills skyrocketing, questions are being asked about the wisdom of investing £8.4 million in a New Zealand company's project. The Skyline venture could potentially destroy the last quiet woodland on the east side of Swansea city. This decision comes in the context of Skyline Enterprises, the project's parent company, reporting Revenue of £171 million in the previous financial year.

>*British people will still be able to go and work in the EU; to live; to travel; to study; to buy homes and to settle down. There will continue to be free trade, and access to the single market. Britain is and always will be a great European power, offering top-table opinions and giving leadership on everything from foreign policy to defence to counter-terrorism and intelligence-sharing – all the things we need to do together to make our world safer.*

Wow, I did not know about this. I am not British but an EU citizen living in the UK. This is a horrible, incredible lie. I simply can't believe that he said that. Now I understand why so many so called Remainers claim that the Brexit referendum was won based on lies. 

An this lie was so well hidden behind a sophism.

*sophism:*

*an argument that seems true but is really false and is used to deceive people*

Boris appears to be right when he says:  *British people will still be able to go and work in the EU; to live; to travel; to study; to buy homes and to settle down.* but in reality the conditions in which the British people would be able to achieve those things are much harder. In fact some British people would not be able to move to EU countries at all under the current conditions. I am convinced that many people that voted to leave though that noting would change for the worse. If all people had known the truth probably Remain would have won. 

But despite all these what I said is still right. I was not talking about the lies of the politicians which I was not aware of. All I said is that if the UK Government had asked the EU to remain in the Single Market after Brexit (which they didn't) then I think that the EU would have accepted this. The UK Government did not ask for this probably because they wanted to terminate free movement and get rid of the rulings of the ECJ.  

In addition Keir Starmer also said that the UK would not join the SM under his Government. However If he does win and changes his mind then I think that he would find openness in the EU so the UK could join the SM. I think it would be harder now than it would have been if this had been requested during the Brexit negotiations but I think it is still possible.",2023-11-12T11:33:34+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

brexit,comment,brexit benefit,g4c1gj9,ewankenobi,,"I think there were lots of reasons why people voted for Brexit. I don't think it helped that the Prime Minister David Cameron wasn't very popular at the time of the referendum and he said he would resign if remain lost. Some people short shortsightedly voted to get rid of Cameron, without really caring either way about the EU. We had been going through years of austerity as a result of a banking crisis at this point. There were lots of people who voted leave as a protest vote as it seemed the ""elite"" were in favour of remain.

Leave had 2 campaign groups. One of them was aimed at picking up the racist vote and blaming everything that was wrong with Britain on immigration and asylum seekers we had to accept due to being in the EU. Whilst the official campaign was most remembered for a bus which said ""We send £350 million to the EU each week, lets spend that money on the NHS instead"". This was a really effective campaign for a couple of reasons. The British population absolutely love the National Health Service and take great pride in it. Plus the figure of £350 million was a complete lie, but leave kept repeating it and the remain side kept arguing the figure was wrong. This became one of the main focuses of the debate and at the end of it all that was left in peoples minds was we send a lot of money to the EU.

I think British people don't have much respect for bureaucracy and the right wing press had always mocked the EU for ridiculous rules, often stretching the truth, but those stories stuck in peoples memories. Whilst the extreme left was going through a renaissance at the time in Britain. Corbyn was the leader and he officially backed remain, but didn't actually do any campaigning with people thinking he really wanted to leave. The left wanted to nationalise everything and felt the EU's state aid would prevent this.

The leave side also did a very good job of online targeted advertising which basically found everyones hot topics and somehow blamed the EU for them. These ads were ridiculous, but I think they were effective sadly:

How does the UK benefit from Brexit (if at all) depends heavily on how you define and value a 'benefit' and what it lost in the Brexit. Which is easier said than done.

For example being able to make trading agreements independently. Sounds great in theory but the UK alone simply doesn't have as much 'muscle' as what the whole of the EU does. Especially since the size of the market matters a lot. In practice the 'great Brexit deals' have so far been rollovers of the earlier EU negotiated deals. How much of value is it really?

The European Commission has just announced an agreement whereby English will be the official language of the European Union rather than German, which was the other possibility. 

As part of the negotiations, the British Government conceded that English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a 5- year phase-in plan that would become known as ""Euro-English"". 

In the first year, ""s"" will replace the soft ""c"". Sertainly, this will make the sivil servants jump with joy. The hard ""c"" will be dropped in favour of ""k"". This should klear up konfusion, and keyboards kan have one less letter.

There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year when the troublesome ""ph"" will be replaced with ""f"". This will make words like fotograf 20% shorter. 

In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. 

Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. 

Also, al wil agre that the horibl mes of the silent ""e"" in the languag is disgrasful and it should go away.

You still seem to be overlooking that *someone* needs to be there temporarily, whether it's a person from a British city, or from Romania.

You seem to be contradicting your own points. People can be mobile, you seem fine with that concept. So why do you keep making out it's very hard for people to be mobile temporarily in the UK?

The amount of time someone can take off has nothing to do with how mobile they are. It has to do with how good the pay is. You seem to be saying that being mobile somehow means the pay is good - I see no connection there.

Subsumed within the Conservative party is a faction who are ideologically opposed to the concept of regulation because they essentially think that the wealthy and powerful should be able to do anything they want in the pursuit of more power and wealth. It's built on an extreme form of the just world fallacy.

On the other hand this is an authoritarian power grab by the executive, whose members will be able to decide which laws to keep and which to discard without any democratic control or oversight. Note that this bill would be unconstitutional in most countries because it breaks separation of powers. Lucky for the UK government, the UK has neither a proper constitution, nor meaningful separation of powers.

What unites both these views is that the people supporting and enacting this are acting in opposition to democracy. They do not care about the effects of this ""bonfire of regulations"" because they don't care about the public good. They are not stupid, but malicious and self-interested.

They are rich and powerful or employed by the rich and powerful, acting to demolish both the constraints that bind them as well as the systems that maintain these constraints.

It does propose copying the New Zealand/Australia/South Africa models which have lead to a decent revival and increase in productivity for farmers there, while attempting to mitigate the environmental impact such removal brings.

Subsidies would instead be mostly diverted into maintenance of environment while selling off some land for development which would be environmentally harmful to constantly farm (i.e it requires more fertilizer to grow crops there) As well as splitting the proceeds with the farmer as agricultural acreage goes for about £7,500 per acre, but with development approval it goes for up to £500,000.

Its proposals on directly subsidising farmers (rather than landowners) is definitely welcome and doing so directly would simplify the system. It's also offering to one-off-payment farmers should they choose to go down the phasing out of subsidies which can be used either to retire, or to invest in new equipment.

It calls on DEFRA to set up a rolling scientific board to study the latest developments and reports to make food safety science based rather than the over precaution system used by the EU at present.

It also would see tariffs removed pretty much in their totality from agricultural products, but would crucially keep british food standards, as this policy has been proven completely workable within the Australian Beef industry. Where they have the option of using growth hormones to make a quick buck, or to not do so to sell their beef to the EU, which has banned this practise and thus commands a higher price.

brexit,post,sovereignty,iqwwh1,mecpaw,[2019] UKSC 41: The Progation Case,"> [41] Two fundamental principles of our constitutional law are relevant to the present case. The first is the principle of Parliamentary sovereignty: that **laws enacted by the Crown in Parliament are the supreme form of law** in our legal system, with which everyone, including the Government, must comply. However, the effect which the courts have given to Parliamentary sovereignty is not confined to recognising the status of the legislation enacted by the Crown in Parliament as our highest form of law. Time and again, in a series of cases since the 17th century, the courts have protected Parliamentary sovereignty from t hreats posed to it by the use of prerogative powers, and in doing so have demonstrated that prerogative powers are limited by the principle of Parliamentary sovereignty. To give only a few examples, in the Case of Proclamations the court protected Parliame ntary sovereignty directly, by holding that prerogative powers could not be used to alter the law of the land. Three centuries later, in the case of Attorney General v De Keyser’s Royal Hotel Ltd [1920] AC 508, the court prevented the Government of the day from seeking by indirect means to bypass Parliament, in circumventing a statute through the use of the prerogative. More recently, in the Fire Brigades Union case, the court again prevented the Government from rendering a statute nugatory through recourse to the prerogative, and was not deflected by the fact that the Government had failed to bring the statute into effect. As Lord Browne - Wilkinson observed in that case at p 552, “the constitutional history of this country is the history of the prerogative powers of the Crown being made subject to the overriding powers of the democratically elected legislature as the sovereign body”.

you know that actually endulging in stereotypes like that makes people really not give even the slightest fuck about whatever else you are ranting right. Especially as the very german you reply to wrote in servicable english.

Germany has about 200 Leo 2s in working order. Leo 2 A7+ are not going to be exported ever. which leaves about 160 Leo2s. To put it franky we are not going to hand over all our tanks. There would have to be an international effort between all countries having leo 2 to partly gift theirs. But seeing as that is a nonstarter as not one country is actually proposing that. I simply dont see where these magic tanks are going to come from.

As for the stupid marders. Rheinmetall is a for profit company. Of course they said they had 100 Marder but it turned out after Scholz gave the order to make them ready that even after Months of work only 6 have so far been restored.

President of France is elected to a 5-year term in a two-round election. If no candidate secures an absolute majority in the 1st round (which happened **always**), a 2nd round is held two weeks later (which would, and probably will, be April 24th), between two candidates who received the most votes. 

**Turnout** in last (2017) elections was 77.8 (1st round) and 74.6% (2nd).

Twelve candidates taking part in the elections are:

It's widely expected that final fight will be decided in 2nd round, held between incumbent president Emmanuel Macron, and ~~Russian fifth column~~ right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen.

Polls close at 20:00 (8 PM) CEST ([link to timezone converter](https://dateful.com/time-zone-converter)), and exit polls should be published soon after.

You know the last army intervention to government? The 28th of February decleration from the army. In 1997 I think. 

And by the military's threat, all the mafia types in the government, pretty much all extremely nationalistic murderous bunch either forced out of official titles, or just went to prison 

He began with releasing all those extreme types from lockdowns. 

The army was never democratic that's for certain, and their interventions always ended up badly. 

But its not like it was ever really out of place. In 1980, politicans were clearly failing to get a hold of the violence and people were killing eachother by the score over left-right wing feuds. 

In 1960, Adnan Menderes, who became prime minister because Atatürk's CHP party, willingly decided to allow democracy to take place and let another party a go against them, was trying to close CHP down when he was losing the public favour and trying to recreate a party-state all over again and the constitution the army dictated was more democratic than the current one even. 

I know it's popular to accuse army interventions constantly, but the only intervention they really fucked up was at 1980, and even then, not their pretext, but their methods to bring peace were the problem. 

Turkish army had always stepped down from power, willingly in a couple of years and always tried to give civil politicians to do something. It's not like the state was ever run by some military general who decided everything for a long time",2022-03-19T18:59:38+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our neighbors don't have Romanian as an option in most schools either. We may communicate in english just as well. Why would we need to learn their language to understand them? It needs to be a **two way effort**, which has more chances of succeeding with English.

Customs union hurts Turkey greatly as Turkey is not considered a part of it when it comes to Turkey exporting. Japan has an agreement with EU so they can sell stuff tax free and EU members can sell their stuff to them tax free. However Turkey has to accept Japanese products tax free due to this (Japan just sets up a company in EU), but we can't sell them anything tax free.

Billions of developmental aid means nothing when you also force us to take care of millions of refugees and send your trash here. EU accession is nothing more than a colonization and enslavement process, that progressed during dictator Erdogan's reign when he was on your side.

Not to mention that anti-EU people would decry it as ""a blatant EU propaganda campaign infrining on our sovereignty"", the more boorish of them comparing it with nazi or communist propaganda.

>People are not interested in abstract, distant, delayed European Union legislation.

That's a problem of the people then, because they certainly are affected by abstract, distant, delayed legislation, by the EU or other legal institutions. I'm not interested in cleaning the toilet either, but it's going to be a stinky mess if I don't, so I get on with it. You don't have a choice to deal only with the interesting problems of politics.

>As a result, the media cannot succesfully and wholly report on the European Union's legislative processes. Not because the media is incompetent or lacking, 

Now I'm taking offense. The media has been sorely neglectful in reporting on EU matters, and in fact specialize in spreading sensational falsehoods in some cases, as in for example the British tabloid press.

>but because the hypothetical demos on which this notion of information is founded does not exist.

You simply refuse to accept another explanation, so you tag that assertion at then end of every comment, nonsequitur or not. Fact of the matter is that the existing media empires are focused on national publics, and retooling for a European public is risky and expensive. So it's safer to stay in the existing channels and ignore what doesn't fit in it. But the first entrepreneurs creating European-wide media are likely to get themselves established as a major player in the whole of Europe for decades to come, so they will, sooner or later. I predict that newspapers will have a general European section, and then a national section named after a previous newspaper taken over by the European holding.",2016-07-07T09:51:58+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

europe,comment,eurosceptics,h2g58sh,Idontknowmuch,,"> Out of the 2 million 593 thousand and 572 eligible voters of Armenia 1 million 281 thousand and 174 citizens, or **49.4%**, participated in the early parliamentary elections, ARMENPRESS reports Chairman of the Central Electoral Commission Tigran Mukuchyan said. https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1056013.html

That's a tiny bit (0.8% to be exact) higher than the 2018 December which is considered a successful election. So it can perhaps be said that relatively speaking the turnout has been good. A recent poll conducted by IRI suggested that about 26% of people who didn't vote in the last elections was because they were not in Armenia at the time.

An exit poll conducted by a civil society organisation *which could be biased towards My Step* released the following exit poll:

50.2% - My Step (Pashinyan)

15.7% - Armenia Alliance (Kocharyan/ARF)

8.4% - I Have Honor (Vanetsyan/HHK/Serzh)

6.4% - Prosperous Armenia (Dodi Gago)

Source: https://civic.am/politics/8847-exit-poll-exit-poll-502-157.html

europe,comment,immigration,i083k1x,shitfit_,,"As a laymen I wondered about the following thing:

Right now Nazi-Russia is losing troops and especially trucks so fast they cant sustain that very long, no? 

If my math is correct they lost already about 9% of their logistics capacity in Ukraine (source: Oryx, for lost trucks; Globalsecurity for number of trucks (around 30) per BTG, around 120BTG are commited to Ukraine).

120BTG á 30 trucks equals 3600 trucks

Trucks, Vehicles and Jeeps lost: 310

&#x200B;

\* The losses of Oryx are those visually confirmed, losses by attrition(e.g. mechanical Breakdown, accidents etc. behind the frontline) or lost without photo/video evidence are not included.

  
Allegedly yesterday Kamaz ran out of parts so they can not produce more (or just a few?). I suppose other companies will run out shortly too. What remains are civilian trucks, which are even harder to maintain in war or cannibalizing the other 40BTGs (40\*30). Also we have seen russia is using Dumptrucks or so as transporters.

&#x200B;

So my question to people knowledgeable on the logistics side of war: How much do hurt these losses of logistic capability the russians? With the economic decline of Nazi-Russia due to the sanctions in place how will that affect the military operation? Will their military now slowly ""starve""?

They're not the largest one and i already explained why they were displaced by Russia. Same reason why the Ottomans displaced  troubling muslim population groups. Not because of religion for the same fate was shared by Christians.

> If the first link, the forceful expulsion of Muslims from the Balkans is just ""reverse imperialism""

If the forceful settling of muslims into the Balkans can be intepreted as colonial imperialism(see the Turkish invasion of Cyprus) then certainly the reverse is the undoing of imperialism. Anyhow, those ""forceful expulsions"" were all mutual, hundreds of thousands of Balkan Christians were killed and expelled and naturally a retaliation was imminent. Even so, it's hardly anything comparable to Turkish practices for aside for a portion of the Turks in Bulgaria, the rest have remained in their place while the much larger autochonous Christian population of Turkey has been genocided and cleansed during both war and peace time.

> what's your view on white farmers being killed and having their land confiscated in some South African countries?

You mean during apartheid? I always supported anti-imperialism movements, it doesn't have to do with religion, i support Palaistine.

I'm not really sure what your first sentence means.  

Well Ireland gained independence over a *century* ago, and took many long decades to reach the GDP it has today. In fact its growth has been rather unique and largely driven by companies headquartering there for tax purposes. It's unlikely Wales can emulate that.  

Furthermore it's questionable how much such economic growth really benefits the country's actual population. The chart below demonstrates this:

This sentence explains in a significant degree the change of the government in Poland in the last elections. Our politicians, celebrities and kind of middle class (this is by the way a strange, somewhat virtual concept in Poland - everyone would like to belong to it and everyone defines it differently and almost no one knows someone who definitely belongs to it) with some participation of normal people - living in few big cities - were benefiting from the transformation while ""lower classes"", people living in ""worse"" voivodeships (e.g. [West Pomeranian Voivodeship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Pomeranian_Voivodeship) or [Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warmian-Masurian_Voivodeship)), smaller cities and in the country didn't gain very much.

Additionally, their problems were addressed with unusual arrogance by politicians (example for these of my Polish compatriots who would like to argue: [Zmień pracę Komorowski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHk_Si27BJo) - you don't even have to click that, right?).

All these PO and leftist politicians supported and praised so much in the Western countries are the main reason for the PiS rule in Poland.

By the way, I was reading your discussion with /u/SlyScorpion and you actually convinced me. The change of government was necessary to show the politicians that (moral) corruption will be punished. The new government does pretty much PR related harm (much too often in the foreign relations area, what especially hurts me) but it also has a will to address problems of economical inequity and it does it pretty effectively.

>It is heavily regulated. The FDA spends hundreds of millions of dollars on food safety research. There's no consensus that GMO's are harmful to eat.

It makes no sense to judge them as a whole. Every GMO is different, and they all have to be evaluated separately. Fact is that GM is a science in its infancy, and we don't really know all that well what DNA does. It's highly experimental, and relying on highly experimental stuff for staple crops isn't a very good idea. It's a matter of risk management, nothing more.

>It's so precise. Crops take years of development and testing before they ever reach the market.

Yes, and in general GMO activists want to keep it that way, and want labels on food so we can detect other, long-term, epidemiological effects we missed in the trials.

While it's clear that a lot of the stuff won't be in it as the negotiations are still ongoing, but you can see the direction the people that wrote the intial draft of the TTIP treaty want to push us in.

I suspect that even if they don't achieve all their demands in TTIP, they'll propose more and more treaties and with more and more lobbying they'll eventually get us to sign everything they initially wanted to achieve with TTIP.

europe,post,unionist,3xgc3u,joavim,Spain votes tomorrow to elect a new parliament and Prime Minister. I wrote a small summary of the parties and possible coalitions.,"Two parties (PP and PSOE) have dominated Spanish politics since the early 1980s and have alternated in government. That seems likely to change tomorrow, with the rise of two newly-formed parties: Podemos and Ciudadanos. 

First of all, ~~here's the latest poll~~ (published in Andorra as opinion polls are not allowed to be published in Spain during the week leading up to the election):

[Poll](http://sondeos.elperiodic.ad/quart-estimacio.jpg)

EDIT: Here's the latest poll (1pm): http://sondeos.elperiodic.ad/quinto-sondeo.html

THE PARTIES

**Partido Popular** (*People's Party*): conservative, centre-right to right-wing. 

The party in government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will likely be again the most voted party in tomorrow's election, but is expected to suffer huge losses (from 44% of the vote in 2011 to between 25% and 30% this year according to the polls).

___________________________________

**PSOE - Partido Socialista Obrero Español** (*Socialist Workers' Party of Spain*): social-democratic, centre-left. 

Pedro Sánchez is the new leader of the Socialists, who fight to stay relevant and avoid being overtaken by Podemos from the left and Ciudadanos from the right.

Will his aggressive stance in the debate with Rajoy work out?

___________________________________

**Podemos** (*We Can*): democratic-socialist, left-wing.

Political Science Professor Pablo Iglesias has moderated his tone and his proposals in an attempt to win votes from the moderate left and have a chance of becoming Prime Minister. 

Their calls for social reform and their opposition to austerity measures have resonated with the struggling working-class, but the other parties have warned of a Syriza style catastrophe.

Podemos is the only major party in Spain that supports a referendum on Catalan sovereignty. 

___________________________________

**Ciudadanos** (*Citizens*): liberal, centre.

Can a 36-year-old called Albert, rather than Alberto, become the next Prime Minister of Spain? Barcelona-born Albert Rivera's poor showings in the debates, coupled with Pablo Iglesias' strong performances, have meant Ciudadanos has plummetted in the polls and is now a distant fourth. 

A liberal party in the European sense with a strong unionist stance, Ciudadanos appeals to the urban middle-class but struggles to set a foothold in decisive rural areas.

Rivera stated on Friday he would abstain if his party is not the most voted party. Many people have interpreted this as meaning they would tacitly support a Rajoy re-appointment as Prime Minister. 

___________________________________

Other parties:

**Izquierda Unida** (*United Left*): democratic-socialist, left-wing to far-left.

The historical party of the democratic-socialist left stems from the Communist Party of Spain, and has seen its very existence threatened by the rise of Podemos. While their leader Alberto Garzón is charismatic and popular, they're unlikely to get more than 4-7 seats.

___________________________________

**Democràcia i Llibertat** (*Democracy and Freedom*, in Catalan): Conservative Catalan nationalists.

After the Catalan elections in September, Catalan President Artus Mas is fighting to get the votes he needs from the far-left pro-independence party CUP to get re-elected as President, and thus to push forward his plan to create an independent Catalan Republic. Meanwhile, his party, with the seats it gets from the four Catalan provinces, could be decisive in the formation of a new Spanish government.

___________________________________

**Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya** (*Republican Left of Catalonia*, in Catalan): Left-wing Catalan nationalists.

ERC united forces with Mas to push for Catalan independence. They could also be decisive.

___________________________________

**Partido Nacionalista Vasco** (*Basque Nationalist Party*): Conservative Basque nationalists.

Unlike their Catalan counterparts, the PNV is not overtly pro-independence. Like them, however, their few seats could prove crucial.

___________________________________

Other regional nationalist parties: Amaiur (Basque left-wing nationalists), BNG (Galician nationalists), CC (Canarian regionalists-nationalists).

POSSIBLE OUTCOMES

- If PP and Ciudadanos achieve an absolute majority (boring option): 

*Scenario 1*: Rajoy will be Prime Minister with the votes of PP and abstention of Ciudadanos. EDIT: I should have made this clearer: this pressuposes of course that PP garners more MPs than the rest of the parties minus Ciudadanos and other parties that might abstain (PNV? CC?).

- If PP and Ciudadanos do not achieve an absolute majority (interesting option): 

The non-Ciudadanos opposition will vote unanimously against Rajoy and he will not be able to get enough votes to be appointed Prime Minister only with his party's votes.

So what next?

*Scenario 2*: PSOE and Podemos reach an absolute majority combined, either Sánchez or Iglesias is appointed Prime Minister in a coalition government or a minority government with parliament support.

*Scenario 3*: PSOE and Podemos fail to reach an absolute majority, but manage to get Sánchez or Iglesias appointed as Prime Minister with the votes in favour or (more likely) the abstention of minor nationalist parties.

*Scenario 4*: PP and PSOE form a grand coalition German style, Rajoy is appointed Prime Minister. Unlikely judging by the statements both parties have offered these days.

*Scenario 5*: Huge mess. Talks fail and no government is formed. The King calls for new elections.

/u/joavim's bet: Scenario 2.

I'm not immune to that sort of bias either; as I said, the push for unity is an important point to me. 

However, I think it's just as important to note what parties are offering outside of that whole argument. Isn't that how we move away from the inherent distrust and naysaying? I like the fact that Sinn Féin support other social causes I believe in, such as opposition to Israeli apartheid and support of green energy initiatives, equal rights and affordable housing, etc. That's north and south.

northernireland,post,brexit,1atrznf,BuggerMyElbow,REVEALED | Overwhelming majority of NI voters back rejoining EU,"### Two-thirds support returning to bloc in new LucidTalk poll

Almost two-thirds of people in Northern Ireland would vote to rejoin the European Union if another referendum were held today, according to a poll.
It shows an increase on the pro-EU vote since the 2016 referendum on the UK’s membership.

The findings emerged after a survey by LucidTalk for Sunday Life and the Belfast Telegraph.

Just over 3,200 people were asked for their view on rejoining.

Some 62 per cent said they would vote to go back in, while 35 per cent would chose to stay out, with 3 per cent unsure or offering no opinion.

In the 2016 referendum, the remain vote in Northern Ireland was 56 per cent, with leave on 44.

Pro-EU feeling was more likely among women in the survey, with 70 per cent saying they would vote to rejoin, compared to 53 per cent of men.

While the pro-EU position was dominant in all age groups, it was more common among 25 to 34-year-olds and 35 to 44-year-olds, with 74 per cent and 70 per cent choosing to rejoin respectively.

This was followed by the 65-plus age group, of which 61 per cent were in favour of rejoining, with 18 to 24-year-olds next on 59 per cent, 45 to 54-year-olds at 56 per cent and 55 to 64-year-olds on 50 per cent.

Analysed by political allegiance, the rejoin option was most popular among SDLP voters, with 99 per cent in support. This was followed by Sinn Fein on 95 per cent and Alliance at 92 per cent, with only 4 per cent and 7 per cent of their voters respectively choosing to stay out.

All but one of the unionist parties’ voters would opt to stay out, with TUV supporters the most staunchly anti-EU at 85 per cent. Eleven per cent would rejoin and 4 per cent were undecided.

They were followed by DUP supporters, with 81 per cent in favour of staying out, 15 per cent wanting to go back into the EU and 4 per cent not sure.

Only 44 per cent of UUP voters said they would vote to stay out, with 48 per cent saying they would vote to rejoin and 8 per cent not sure.

The survey also asked which way each person voted in the 2016 referendum, if they voted at all.

Of those who voted to leave, only 20 per cent would chose to rejoin, with 75 per cent sticking with their original decision and 5 per cent undecided.

Remain voters were the least moveable on the issue, with 92 per cent backing rejoining, 6 per cent supporting leaving and 2 per cent unsure.

When it came to non-voters in the 2016 poll, 74 per cent would now opt to rejoin, 24 per cent would stay out and 2 per cent were undecided.

The research was carried out between February 9 and 12 and the sample was weighted to reflect the population.

The survey also canvassed reaction to the DUP’s Stormont return, showing Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s party has been hit with a drop in support.

The so-called Donaldson deal, which Sir Jeffrey says will bring about significant changes in the post-Brexit trading arrangements between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, was backed by more than two-thirds of unionist voters.

When asked who they would vote for first in an Assembly election, the responses saw DUP support slide four points to 24 per cent, with Sinn Fein still the largest party on 31 per cent.

It was kind of a soft gerrymander because it meant unionist seats were protected with some very slim victory margins.

So SF aren't the largest in Belfast, slipping to second. SDLP have further losses, UUP are down.

northernireland,comment,labour,jlusr99,IrishBogBunny,,"The DUP could enter a coalition with Labour if the next election delivers a hung parliament, former leader Dame Arlene Foster has suggested.  
Opinion polls suggest Sir Keir Starmer’s party is on course for victory next year - but may fall short of an overall majority.  
  
That could open the door for an alliance with other parties.  
  
In 2017, the DUP signed a ‘confidence and supply agreement’ with the Conservatives to prop up Theresa May’s minority government.  
  
Labour has usually aligned with the SDLP at Westminster, making it politically harder for the DUP to follow suit.  
  
But asked on GB News if it was “fanciful to even think that there could ever be any sort of agreement with the Labour Party and the DUP”, she said: “No, I don't think so. I don't think so at all.  
  
  
“I think there are quite good relationships with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Kyle, and indeed with Sir Keir as well.”  
  
The DUP were contacted for a response.  
  
A Labour spokesperson said: “We’re campaigning for a majority Labour government and we’re confident we can achieve that.”  
  
The latest YouGov polling puts Labour on 43%, the Conservatives on 25% and the Liberal Democrats on 12%.  
  
Experts say Labour’s support may not be enough to win an overall majority at the next election, expected in October 2024, resulting in a hung Parliament.  
  
The party with the most seats is usually asked to form a government but, for a majority, will need support from other parties - either through a formal coalition, such as the Conservatives’ 2010 pact with the Lib Dems, or a looser alliance like the Tories’ 2017 deal with the DUP.  
  
Dame Arlene added: “I’m looking with interest at the polls at the moment and the possibility of a hung parliament coming again. And at that time (2017), we took a decision not to go into formal coalition but to go into a confidence and supply agreement where we would support on particular issues, particularly around Brexit at that time and to bring benefit for the people of Northern Ireland, which we did through the arrangements.  
  
“I think if it happens at the next general election again the party leader will have to decide whether to go into coalition, whether to go into a confidence and supply agreement, and whether it's good for the people of Northern Ireland and whether it's good for the nation as a whole, which is one of the reasons why we did it.  
  
""We felt we were allowing the nation to honour the Brexit vote which had taken place. So there's a whole load of imponderables, but I'll watch very carefully with interest if it happens the next time around.”  
  
Her comments came in a far-reaching interview in which she also opened up about her life growing up in Northern Ireland.

And no one is a colonist or a settler here either.

The terms in which you put things seem designed to anger or provoke, and they conflate the worst elements of organised Unionism-Loyalism with anyone who might happen to vote for a Unionist party. That’s either disingenuous or naive… or trolling.

As to your claim about racism… that’s a complicated situation. People are just as racist on either ‘side’ but loyalist paramilitaries encourage it and are a ready-made means through which racism can be channeled.

Also, the empty houses are in loyalist areas – the demand is much higher in nationalist areas for Executive housing but this demand is not met because of sectarian one-for-you-one-for-me politics. NIHE temporarily houses asylum seekers in loyalist areas because that’s what’s available.

Yes, political Unionism-Loyalism’s ideological makeup is largely exceptionalism, national chauvinism and and an unreconstructed imperialism that would excuse sectarianism past and present (and the ‘patriotism’ and right-wing bent make a good fit for racism). But you are so vociferously poisonous and reductive that you tar all with this brush. Many people vote DUP very reluctantly as they feel it is all they can do. They may well be wrong about this, of course, even on their own maintain-the-Union terms, but it is a hard thing to see through.

You are black and white in a complicated and changing situation and that is unhelpful and unempathetic. You are railing against a caricature of Unionism that people like John Taylor or Willie Ross or Jim Allister might represent. Yes, the dynamic in Unionism-Loyalism is such that the extremists steer the ship, with perpetual crises and betrayals everywhere.

But a bit of fuckin’ nuance and kindness, please. You’re generalising about people – your neighbours – in a selective way that at the very least could be perceived as being sectarian – and that’s _me_ being kind.

What you post and comment is indistinguishable from trolling – either juvenile baiting of anyone unionist or from that background, or from someone who sought to portray nationalism in a bad light.

northernireland,post,passport,ukz7cy,archdall,Some thoughts on the election,"On Friday I went for a walk around Milltown Cemetary in West Belfast, something I do every few months because it's a place of so many fascinating stories, many of them terrible. A name on a memorial catches my eye, I Google it, and discover how someone ended up with their name carved in stone in front of me. This time I came across the story of Philip Rafferty. When the 14-year-old lad left his home in west Belfast to go to band practice, his mother, Maureen, made sure he was wearing his new winter coat. The next time she saw it was in a plastic bag at his inquest, saturated with blood.

On January 30th, 1973, Philip was on his way home when he was abducted from the street by loyalist paramilitaries. He was taken to the Giant’s Ring, not far from where I live where they hooded him with his coat, beat him, and then shot him several times.

Bewildering. Maureen his mother had other children whom she sent away to England  and for decades she said nothing in public about his death. In 2019 she was reported as marvelling  at what Belfast had become: “Isn’t it wonderful? There are so many businesses coming on now, and there are so many nationalities of people – you hear the different accents, the different tongues.""

And Belfast is indeed a wonderful city, and Northern Ireland is now a great place to raise a family, but what of the future? 

The 39% of people who didn't vote in the Stormont elections last week don't care very much for politicians here. People like a neighbour of mine, working class, loves cars and his little boys, a Prod with a mixed background, grew up here in the 1980s when he says there were loads of 'scumbags' around, still a few but it's not so bad. He never votes because he thinks politicians are all yuppies who take big salaries, talk shite and never get anything done. He has a point.

The Shinners have now got the most seats in Stormont. They will use this to further their agenda for a United Ireland. But they've actually only increased their seats by one (correction: SF has the same number of seats as 2017). They have done nothing to win any votes from Prods and they never will. Their share is as high as it ever will be unless the SDLP disappears altogether, and together the nationalist parties still have a numerical minority of seats in Stormont. A majority of seats are held by parties who favour the status quo, even if they have different views on why the status quo is a good thing. And there are plenty from West Belfast who've had to pay the IRA protection money over the years or lose their businesses who don't vote either. And many of the families of those in other Republican factions who were killed by Provo or Official IRA gunmen dont think much of Sinn Féin. The well tended graves are all there in Milltown.

Meanwhile the DUP continue to trip over their own shoelaces while shooting themselves in both feet. The chances of them blocking the formation of a government are very high as they wrestle with the consequences of their own stupid support for Brexit. Hyper sensitive to NI's position within the UK, they continue to get out manoeuvred by themuns in West Belfast. And as they dig themselves a bigger hole, we have to ask what is behind the fear that is the foundation of loyalist thinking and identity, a fear that could provoke people to kill a 14 year old boy in the 1970s, and which for many thousands hasn't gone away you know. At this point I could take you on a historical journey through Irish rebellions, back to 1641,  to 1798, to 1919, and make the point that is uncomfortable for many Irish people to hear, which is that every time there has been a significant Irish rebellion, thousands of Prods have been slaughtered. 

And before we get into a thread of whataboutery, all I would say is that for a certain caste of Prod, the fear of what would become of them in a United Ireland is not to be dismissed. If the lens through which you have seen what Irishness means is Sinn Féin it  isn't that surprising. The fear is real, and potentially very dangerous. 

What about The Alliance party? For many people outside Northern Ireland, the Alliance party seems like a welcome breath of common sense, and indeed they have done really well. I  voted for them, and they secured two MLAs in my constituency of South Belfast. 

But bear in mind that of the five MLAs with the highest number of first preference votes, four were from SF, and of the five MLAs elected with the lowest number of first preferences four were from The Alliance. The voting system suits the Alliance well as they are the only party to pick up transfers from unionist and nationalist voters as UUP and SDLP, and also Green voters. The reality is they are a protest vote against the entrenched camps, the dogma, and an expression of an inchoate ideology that Northern Ireland should be normal, its own thing, an everyday place, but unique nonetheless, to be peaceful, because of and not in spite of its past.

So, will there be a United Ireland any time soon? I don't think so. I used my Irish passport as ID when I went to vote. I work for the Irish state, but do I think the turbulence of achieving Irish unity, let alone the cost, would be worth it? I don't think so. When the people of this little part of the world are united, then and only then is a union with the Republic likely to take place peacefully, and we're a long, long way from that. In the meantime, all we want of our politicians is to fix the health service, integrate our schools, create opportunities for the young so that they don't have to leave, and make sure the old and the infirm are taken care of.

It’s been largely memory holed now but prior to the Omagh Bomb, McKevitt Real IRA instigated a fairly large bombing campaign in mid Ulster in Bambridge, Moira, Belleek and at least one failed attack where the bomb car was found outside (I think) Armagh city.

While we can’t know what McKevitt’s intention was for sure it was possibly something like destabilise the situation with random bombings so the peace process somehow collapses because SF aren’t the representatives of the IRA anymore. McKevitt was a complete cunt so fuck knows what his thinking really was. 

Anyway since the Omagh Bomb, there’s been persistent rumours that the Brits had intel and let the bomb happen. This is different to collusion where the brits would have made it happen. 

The High Court had a case on it a few years ago and didn’t find much basis evidence of prior intel, the only thing (from memory) is did uk telephone  intel get shared with the RUC. There’s going to be an inquiry on if all the random bits of intel had been pooled could it have stopped the bomb.

>Until relatively recently, the Scottish National Party was lucky in its opponents. In government, the Labour Party created the political institutions that turbo-charged the nationalist movement, transforming it from a party with half a dozen MPs into one with more than 40 full time parliamentarians, each one with at least three full-time staff who would henceforth be paid from the public purse to campaign for independence.  
>  
>Then the Labour-led Scottish Executive (as it was then known) legislated to abolish Labour’s advantage in Scottish local government, introducing the single transferable vote system that vastly increased the number of nationalists in every council in the land while reducing the voice of Unionism. This was a deliberate policy, remember.  
>  
>Then prime minister Gordon Brown responded to the SNP’s narrow victory at the 2007 Holyrood elections by re-opening the devolution settlement, thereby creating the pattern that nationalist advances should be rewarded with more powers. Brown’s successor wanted in on the act too, so David Cameron conceded that a devolved election in Scotland could, somehow, create a mandate for the UK government to do whatever the SNP demanded. And so he agreed to authorise an independence referendum. Following the victory for the No campaign, Cameron then shafted his former allies in the Better Together campaign by introducing English Votes for English Laws (EVEL), and then devolved even more powers to the SNP as a reward for losing the referendum.  
>  
>That’s quite a record for an establishment that, on paper at least, is supposed to be defenders of the Union. And if that pattern of complacency and capitulation had continued after Cameron resigned, we might now be staring a separate Scotland in the face. Fortunately, Theresa May, whatever her other faults, was made of sterner stuff and flatly rejected Nicola Sturgeon’s absurd demands that she be granted the power to hold a second “once in a lifetime” referendum.  
>  
>Boris Johnson adopted the approach of his immediate predecessor, much to the bewilderment of the Scottish political and media establishment who were used to the SNP getting their own way in everything. But Johnson’s “Union Unit”, which was supposed to be the nerve centre of his government strategy to defend the United Kingdom against the nationalist threat, has not fared well and was abolished following the successive resignations of its two heads.  
>  
>Perhaps that lack of focus is why we have headlines today suggesting that senior cabinet ministers will urge the prime minister to extend the franchise of a future referendum to include ex-patriot Scots living elsewhere in the UK. The Scottish diaspora, at least that part still living in Britain, is thought to be more pro-Union than pro-nationalist, and so this wheeze is seen as just the thing to spike the guns of the first minister as she gears up to demand another referendum.  
>  
>The fact that the suggestion is absurd and self-defeating seems not to have occurred to its proponents, which is a pity.  
>  
>The details and politics of the actual proposal are of secondary importance to the wider strategic issue of whether this helps the Unionist cause. It is certainly true that among Cameron’s many missteps back in 2012, one of his biggest was in allowing Alex Salmond to choose the franchise that suited the Yes campaign best, which in this case included children and foreigners, on the basis that school pupils and people with little stake in the country’s future might be easier persuaded to favour independence. So if there is to be another referendum, obviously the franchise would have to be revisited.  
>  
>But to allow Scots (however you define them) who have chosen to live elsewhere in the UK to have the same say as those of us still living in Scotland looks cynical – because it is – and is politically unviable. As Hugo Rifkind points out elsewhere, it would obviously be unacceptable if expat Scots voted in such a way as to edge the argument in favour of independence, against the wishes of the majority of Scots living here. So why would the opposite effect be acceptable and democratic?  
>  
>But the very fact that cabinet ministers are even discussing what franchise should be used is a massive own goal for the pro-UK campaign. Nicola Sturgeon is under tremendous pressure in her party on this, the only issue SNP activists care about. The first minister knows she can’t force the UK government to concede another referendum and she is determined not to go down the road that of a divisive, illegal and unofficial referendum which would be boycotted by Unionists.  
>  
>In short, she is facing the biggest challenge of her career and there are very few ways around it. What she desperately needs is some sign from Westminster that her “demands” \[sic\] are being listened to and even acted upon. Whatever happened to the aphorism that one should never interrupt one’s opponent when he is making a mistake?  
>  
>Scotland is not being held in the Union against its will; it voted to remain seven years ago after a campaign in which all sides agreed such referendums must, by definition, be the rarest of beasts. Since she was one of those who stated this fact in unambiguous terms, Sturgeon is particularly vulnerable to criticism by her impatient troops. Why are Conservative politicians now seeking to throw her a lifeline?

(Irrespective of the fact is any reputable EU company is going to sponsor someone that young in any meaningful role!? - err no, that was the beauty of barrier free FOM for young grad talent) In terms of the UK economy, if I'm out I'm out because of the significant barrier and effort/cost to move. Pre Brexit I'm bringing that talent and training back to the UK, and I can decide to do it over the course of a week - exactly what I did. 

Especially post COVID - what we'd all be doing now is working on remote projects consulting in Europe but being based here. The counterfactual and alt scenario of Remain post COVID would have put the UK at the heart of EU services in so many sectors, growth would have been off the charts but the boats sailed and our remote market is just the UK largely (for now)

In 2014, my company handled it all for me and for a handful of workmates I also went with, found a flat for me and I had no visa or tax issues - there's minimal risk on my side. If I don't like it I just come back to the UK in the same job - I haven't left any training programme on my way to get chartered. 

British hqs rarely offer this opportunity to any extent compared to pre Brexit any more because of the tax implication, visa and workforce law disparity and legal overhead for compliance.

ukpolitics,comment,eu,kvl34pk,DakeyrasWrites,,"For all this stuff about replacing Sunak as PM, he was (at the time he was parachuted into No10) one of the most popular Tories with the public, and he's collapsed like a house of cards. Are there any possible names who would a) be more likeable off the bat (not more likeable than Sunak now, but more likeable than he was when he got into power) and b) would take the job (so not Ben Wallace, for example)?

I genuinely think that merely being leader of the Tories is enough to tank the popularity of whoever would be installed next. As a cabinet minister or backbencher you can have your own brand to a small extent, and distance yourself a little bit from some of the more unpopular stuff the government is doing, but as soon as you're in charge you're now to blame for everything.

Also, whoever would be getting put in would probably not call an immediate GE (that would mean they're likely to tie or beat Truss for shortest time as PM) so whatever bounce they might hypothetically get, it'd likely decay by the time a GE is actually called.

Personally I think the odds of Sunak being forced out prior to a GE are low, but there's plenty of Tories that'd take their five minutes in the sun because they know they'd never be PM in any other way.

For one, as the UK has a large public debt, zero growth or negative growth as a stated aim would instantly wreck our credit rating and mean that we would be paying much more to service our debt.

(https://behindthepaywallblog.wordpress.com/2017/02/04/our-politicians-want-to-lead-us-out-of-the-eu-but-they-dont-seem-to-have-a-clue-how-it-works/)

In fact, though, the answer was staring me in the face, in the foreword by David Davis to the White Paper, where he tells us: (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/589191/The_United_Kingdoms_exit_from_and_partnership_with_the_EU_Web.pdf)

>We approach these negotiations from a unique position. As things stand, we have the exact same rules, regulations and standards as the rest of the EU. Unlike most negotiations, these talks will not be about bringing together two divergent systems but about managing the continued cooperation of the UK and the EU. The focus will not be about removing existing barriers or questioning certain protections but about ensuring new barriers do not arise.

This, it very much seems, is underpinning the Government's strategy on Brexit – a belief that, because we have already secured regulatory convergence, there are no more barriers to overcome and that we can continue to trade freely with our former EU partners. 

We thus have the same flawed premise that was perpetrated by Peter Lilley, who asserted that, ""the UK starts off in full conformity with EU product regulations etc so there can be no problem agreeing 'regulatory conformity' at the point of Brexit, even if we have to agree at a later stage how to avoid divergence"". (http://www.peterlilley.co.uk/publications/1920/richard-norths-papers-brexit)

According to one Booker commenter, all that needs to happen is that: ""The parties agree to maintain free trade and therefore to set in place arrangements for monitoring free trade in a new relationship to complete within three years, during which trade will continue under the present rules directly related to free trade"".

""To enable discussion between the coffee break and lunch, an outline of stages can be agreed between heads of government while their officials can compile an annex of relevant regulations, either by specifics or category or other high level categorisation to highlight where there might be doubt"". And that, we are told, ""is all that is need in a treaty: starting point, an end point in broad terms, timescale, stages where necessary"". 

As to the rest, that is ""for subsidiary agreement by MoU or whatever. The most important thing is to move quickly to a binding agreement to terminate the current treaties and move forward to an agreed destination"".

I include this text because it so much accords with the Government line, and this air of unreality that everything will be alright on the night. Mrs May can jet into Brussels, have breakfast in the Ambassador's rather agreeable resident and then sweep into the ""egg"" to agree on the heads of a free trade agreement, and be on her way back after lunch. 

What has completely escaped the attention of Ministers (and most of the commentariat) is that, by leaving the EU, we assume the status of a third country. And this, as I have pointed out, is not something the EU does to us. We ourselves voluntarily place ourselves in this category. It is our choice, something we have actively sought. 

We are not then in a position of – as David Davis argues – of ""ensuring new barriers do not arise"". It is a question of dealing with all those (considerable) barriers that already exist. And this is the point: the EU is not going to raise new barriers. They already exist. 

I've used this analogy before, but bear with me. You must imagine a medieval walled city, inside which the traders happily do business – with the public and between themselves – secure within the fortifications. 

When one of the traders (unhappy with the rules and regulations applying inside the walls) decides to move his stall outside the walls, he cannot then complain that he is no longer able to trade freely with the people still inside the walls. 

This stands for the EU, where there are often three layers of protection. First, an individual country must be approved and put on a list of those countries which are permitted to export; then individual businesses (or ""establishments"") must be approved, and then individual consignments must be checked and cleared, before they are allowed through the gateway. 

As time has progressed, many of the third countries have done deals with the European Union, to expedite the passage of goods into the ""walled city"". The walls remain – trade is eased because special arrangements are made to get the goods in. 

With the UK newly assuming third country status though, it is starting from scratch. From the EU's perspective, it is as if a brand new country had suddenly dropped in from outer space and landed 22 miles off the French coast. Before Brexit, there was no third country called the United Kingdom. On Brexit day, there will be an entirely new addition to its list. 

That this newly created third country will try to conclude a free trade agreement with its neighbours is only to be expected. But with or without such an agreement, the UK will still be a third country. As does South Korea, it will still have to appoint ""only representatives"" to register its chemicals under REACH, and its slaughterhouses will have to be in the EU's list of approved establishments before it can export meat to the Member States. 

And nor can it be any different. It the EU makes special concessions to the UK, then all the other third countries (and the EU-based importers of their products) will arise in protest. They will demand the same deal, failing which either the Member States or the Commission could find themselves in front of the ECJ. 

Since the UK hasn't actually just arrived from outer space though (even if there may be questions about some of our politicians), there is the possibility of making a transitional agreement, to ease the passage of the UK from full member of the EU to its new, third country status. 

And here, albeit unwittingly, Davis has got it right. We are in a ""unique position"". Never before has a country broken away from the EU and thus scrapped all the existing agreements, having to assume as of new the status of a third country with no legacy agreement to carry over. 

We are not, therefore, ""managing the continued cooperation of the UK and the EU"". The focus will be about adjusting to our new status as a third country and making all the necessary arrangements which enable the UK to continue exporting goods (and services) to the EU. 

And since the rules for different products (https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/international_affairs/trade/non-eu-countries_en) and sectors are different, and each approval has to be made on a case-by-case basis, the UK is going to have to have to lodge multiple applications, and then sit down with Commission officials to work out how best to proceed. There can be no short cuts. Britannia cannot waive the rules. (http://ec.europa.eu/health//sites/health/files/files/documents/active_pharmaceutical_ingredients_leaflet_en.pdf)

Dealing with this huge amount of detail is not going to be quick or easy. Other third countries have taken decades to build up their portfolios of agreements which enable them to trade more or less freely. The UK will have to do the same. 

Thus, we have to agree with the Observer which suggests that Mrs May's belief (apparently shared by her Cabinet): (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/05/parliament-must-ensure-second-brexit-referendum?CMP=share_btn_tw)

>… that we will be able to negotiate a full deal within two years of triggering article 50 appears deluded, given that free-trade agreements typically take far longer to negotiate and ratify, even when they do not include the fiendishly complicated negotiations around services that she wants included in any final deal.

In fact, we were ahead of the game, calling the White Paper an act of delusion, not least for the failure to acknowledge the UK's new status as a third country (http://eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=86365). But the government must get a grip. The very last thing we need on Brexit day is for a group of ministers to find themselves huddled outside the walls of the city wondering what to do next.

ukpolitics,post,fptp,6eln76,hakim_the_dream,Should we replace the First Past the Post (FPTP) System?,"As you might be aware, there was the UK alternative vote (AV) referendum back in 2011 where around 68% voted no to the replacement of the FPTP system in favour of the alternative vote. However, following the 2015 GE, some have argued that the election results have been very disproportionate.

Should there perhaps be another referendum to change the FPTP system? I'm sure there are numerous cases for and against this. From my own knowledge, it might be that the Single Transferable Vote (STV) is better in the short term and the long term as opposed to AV.

I think a huge plus for using STV over FPTP would be a more representative electorate, and more accurate polling to a certain extent.

EDIT: here's an article on 10 reasons why the AV referendum was lost (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/06/reasons-av-referendum-lost). I suppose that half the parties would learn from the outcomes of the referendum? In either case, I think that the STV might be preferable over AV, but again those campaigning for the referendum would need to ensure that UK citizens are not ill-informed in public debates.

EDIT 2: Thank you to all of you for outlining your opinions as well as the pros and/or cons on FPTP and other kinds of systems (i.e. AV, STV, MMP, Two-party etc)! At the moment, i'm seeing that the main debate in this thread seems to be the extent to which the UK electorate should be representative of the demographic/population. I would also like to highlight that whilst the 2011 UK AV referendum may have some shortcomings (+campaign failures), perhaps we should still look up more on how other systems other than FPTP might be better in the long run?

Some countries like France and the Ukraine achieve this with a 2-round voting system.

ukpolitics,comment,fptp,g16jg58,slideyfoot,,"I can see where you're coming from. I voted Lib Dem for the first few elections I was eligible for, partly because I also strongly believe in electoral reform. When I moved to Bristol after the 2010 election, I started voting Labour, mainly because I was very disappointed by the Lib Dems totally messing up their big chance to push for PR. 

Since then, I've been impressed by my local Labour MP, she's proved to be excellent. I have wanted to vote Lib Dem again, or Green, but the candidates they've put up here have been unimpressive (at least in my constituency. The Lib Dem candidate never even bothered showing up to hustings). 

So this year I went ahead and signed up to the Labour party, as I'm sick of waiting for the Lib Dems to become viable. At least as a Labour member I can vote for leaders who are hopefully more likely (and prominent enough, as opposed to the Lib Dems and Greens) to try and implement the policies I want (I originally joined to vote for Jess Phillips, then switched to Lisa Nandy when Phillips dropped out). 

FPTP is very much in the Tories interest, so they are never going to change it. Judging by demographic shifts and constituency changes, it is not going to be in Labour's interest, but Blair demonstrated that when they actually get into power, they will happily kick electoral reform into the long grass. 

I guess a UKIP/Brexit Party approach may work for electoral reform, with a strong push as a single issue party putting pressure on the two major ones, getting that issue firmly onto the agenda.

Do you think the financial services will stick around if there’s no longer free movement of capital and tariff-free financial services with Europe? Perhaps they will, if the U.K. ends up as some rich man’s low-tax playground. Regardless, we see a further increase in poverty in the U.K. Then, how much sway do you think we hold with former empire, especially if we commit economic self-harm; whatever residual fealty to British imperialism that remains would be shattered; the illusion of British power would be gone, with the erosion of British soft power you cite, after our display of irrationality and political incompetence in the eyes of the world. Leaving Eu on reasons of sovereignty is, as far as I can see, some archaic power fantasy and I can’t see how it will turn out well. 
As part of the Eu, we enjoy all the things you say. Why do you want to return to some idea of individual nation against the world? What real benefit do you see this bringing? Power, empire, increased riches, prosperity for all - I think it’s going to make us poorer, and I can’t see how any long-term increase in wealth will ever make it back into society and improving life for the people of Britain. I see it leaving us commanding less of that soft power than we wield now whilst also a major player of the Eu; unless we go all militaristic, which is power based on threat and preparing for war. I don’t like that prospect either.
I genuinely would like to know why you think this is a good move. What benefit will this bring for the immediate and future of Britain and what’s the benefit for society?

You could say the same of many young university educated people. The economy has left them behind (hello internships! hello roles that previously required no degree!), their culture is increasingly caught between an aging population and lucrative teen market, the dignity of education is demeaned in a world where one person's informed opinion is worth the same as an uninformed opinion (""this country is tired of experts""), and the technocratic emphasis has lead to increased tuition fees, triple locked pensions, and a skyrocketing housing market.

However, we have been largely told that life is tough and we should be less entitled. 

It's the great political correctness shaped elephant in the room that the same view can nigh on *never* be expressed to the working class - you grew up in the fourth largest economy in the world during a time of near unprecedented peace and prosperity, with free education, now able to enjoy revolution of the internet...what more does the world owe you?

And while a court cannot take into account what future legislation might say, it can recognise that there exists a constitutional obligation to give effect to a referendum outcome. If such an obligation exists then it could well be viewed as an ‘effect in all the circumstances’ for the purposes of s.29(3). And if it is taken to have a constitutional effect through established practice or convention, even in the absence of self-executing legal effects, then it would, in light of the Supreme Court’s interpretation of s.29(3), most likely be taken to ‘relate to’ the Union or to the Parliament of the United Kingdom and therefore to fall beyond the competence of the devolved institutions.",2022-10-06T17:57:12+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

>  
>Seven years after the referendum on leaving the EU, the Greater London authority (GLA) had planned to fly the flag on Friday but officials were advised that under the latest regulations they would need to secure permission from the local authority.  
>  
>Without so-called advertising consent from Newham council, City Hall, which is the headquarters of the GLA and is where Sadiq Khan, the capital’s mayor, is based, would have been liable to criminal prosecution under the amended town and country planning (control of advertisements) regulations.  
>  
>There is no such consent required for flying the flag of any country in England.  
>  
>Also exempt are the flags representing the Commonwealth, the United Nations, sports clubs, the NHS, specified award schemes such as eco-schools and the rainbow flag of six horizontal equal stripes of red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet.  
>  
>Until 2021 the EU flag had also been among those that did not require permission but the law applying to England was changed as a response to the UK’s departure from the bloc on 31 January 2020.  
>  
>Encouragement was instead issued by ministers at the time to fly the union flag of the UK throughout the year on national government and local authority buildings.  
>  
>Khan will instead use lights to display the EU flag’s blue and yellow colours on the building to mark the anniversary of the Brexit vote.  
>  
>A City Hall source said: “The mayor is proud to fly flags from City Hall – from the Union flag to the Ukraine flag in recent times. Flying a flag is a way of showing solidarity, expressing our values, and showing pride in the identities we share.  
>  
>“With over a million people calling London their home from other European countries it’s extraordinary that the government has effectively banned the European flag being flown without going through a long and bureaucratic planning process.

>  
>Seven of the 10 areas with the highest share of the vote for remain were in London, including Hackney, Lambeth and Haringey, where more than 75% of votes were to stay in the bloc.  
>  
>In an open letter to Londoners from one of the 27 EU member states to mark the anniversary of the referendum, Khan writes: “Seven years ago today our country voted to leave the European Union. It was a heartbreaking day for me, and I know it was for many of you too.  
>  
>“There is no doubt that in the years since, Brexit has caused huge damage to our city and created a great deal of uncertainty for many of you. But you stayed with us.  
>  
>“Despite the appalling uncertainty over settled status, despite being used as bargaining chips in the negotiations and despite the antimigrant rhetoric coming from this government, you kept the faith and continued to make London your home.”

While I agree with the first part, this is likely not true. If the UK genuinely tried to rejoin the EU it’d probably skip most of the queue, since we already meet most of the requirements, could relatively easily re-align our laws and also, as a practical matter, the UK is just larger and more worth having than, say North Macedonia or Albania, as cold as that is. The political and economic arguments would win out against a ‘moral’ one if there were such a thing (I’d argue there wouldn’t even be one since the ‘queue’ isn’t so much a waitlist more a ‘you need to fulfil the requirements before we let you in’ list). 

Additionally I think it would probably be a bad move on the EU’s part to try and take a punitive stance towards the UK if the UK were to try and rejoin, it’d be an own goal allowing the anti-EU crowd to demonise the EU further.",2022-10-28T19:35:36+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

Outperforming the most similar economic nations would demonstrate that we've succeeded outside of the EU - we've achieved more than we otherwise would have. We were on par with Germany, and right now we're ahead in some ways and behind in others. If we can go more ahead in more ways, or far ahead in some ways, we might call it a success, but time will out.

As for Norway and Switzerland, they were *already ahead* when they joined their respective frameworks. They have negotiated special privileges with the EU as a consequence of their power. We, as founding members of the EU, only got to contribute partially to thing which massively protect our interests - everything we voted for had to be weighed up against the votes of everyone else, and ultimately resulted in a weaker position for us.

The lead Tory until the Brexit referendum, aka David Cameron, literally stood down as PM and as an MP when Brexit was voted for by the public. **None** of the political parties in the UK, aside from UKIP (and by default the Brexit party), supported Brexit in any meaningful nor majoritarian way. To say that any of them touted the benefits is nonsense. The Conservative party got massively shaken up by Brexit, and Labour didn't fall far behind. Leaders who followed Cameron have of course talked about the best ways we can handle Brexit (they were voted into leadership *because* they were the few who supported it).

What Labour is going to do is impossible to say right now. What Sunak is going to do, equally so. I suspect we'll see a red party and a blue party, and only one will prosper. Hell, with how Starmer has approached everything so far it's extremely easy for me to see him miss an open goal and hand leadership over to a Conservative/LD coalition.

What the UK has gained by leaving is exactly what the people voted for - the ability to set our own laws, to define our own economic outlook, to be free from European dictatorial leadership. Whether you voted for it or against, Brexit was a consequence of all of the above and more. The fact that we've not used these abilities, yet we're still seemingly ahead (albeit marginally) leaves questions unanswered about the actual impact. But again, as I said above, the last thing we should do now is to introduce more uncertainty. We know that we are outside of the EU, and we know vaguely what that means. Sit tight, see what happens. If investors are happier, we'll see the results. If businesses struggle with regulations, likewise.

Correct, but is that really an indication of anything other than the nature of a demonstration.  At a demonstration in support of the victims of October 7th, how many people would express sympathy with Palestinians.  Should we take from this that everyone at such a demonstration wants every Palestinian dead?  Seems like a massive leap.

> I don’t call for retribution against the people of Gaza. I say that it is coming and it’s Hamas’ fault.

Retribution against a people constitutes a war crime.  The whole point of a war crime is that they cannot be justified by any act of aggression or war or by the committing of war crimes against you.  They are, by definition, the things you *cannot* do, even when engaged in active lethal military combat. 

> But they don’t come close to obeying the Geneva conventions

Obviously not. Again, it’s in the nature of the Geneva conventions that having them broken by the opposing belligerents cannot justify anyone breaking them, because civilians are by their nature… not belligerents.  It’s a total non-sequitur that Hamas has broken the Geneva conventions. 

> And again, it is Hamas who should be blamed for it, not Jews living in Britain, for gods sake.

Obviously not, nor Jews in Israel.  No civilian should ever be blamed for the actions of their country’s leadership, whether they’re democratically elected, or a brutal psychopathic terrorist death cult - that's *my* point. Least of all should we hold people accountable for the actions of countries which act in the name of their religion. The actions of Israel should be focused on Hamas, providing security for their citizens, protecting civilians and returning hostages, not bringing retribution on the *people of Gaza*. Why would they do that?  It’s a war crime, it brings horror to innocent people, many of them children, it would further inflame the situation and give Hamas exactly what they want, including acting as a recruiting tool, it’s a waste of resources and would threaten hostages.

Yes, true. Though what I find interesting about it is that is this is an example of the UK's representative democracy in action. Thinking about representative democracy we come back again to the question whether an MP is there to serve the will of their constituents, or their constituents' best interests. At the moment many MPs seem willing to make the call one way or the other based on what serves them best in the moment.   

>Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion … Parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and hostile interests, which interests each must maintain, as an agent and advocate, against other agents and advocates; but parliament is a deliberative assembly of one nation, with one interest, that of the whole; where, not local purposes, not local prejudices ought to guide, but the general good, resulting from the general reason of the whole. You choose a member indeed; but when you have chosen him, he is not member of Bristol, but he is a member of parliament.

Edmund Burke's Speech to the Electors of Bristol, 3 Nov. 1774. 

>The first duty of a member of Parliament is to do what he thinks in his faithful and disinterested judgement is right and necessary for the honour and safety of Great Britain. His second duty is to his constituents, of whom he is the representative but not the delegate. Burke's famous declaration on this subject is well known. It is only in the third place that his duty to party organisation or programme takes rank. All these three loyalties should be observed, but there in no doubt of the order in which they stand under any healthy manifestation of democracy.

unitedkingdom,comment,brexit,koft6ii,cococrabulon,,"> I grew up in an area that voted Brexit, as frustrated as I was by Brexit, I can actually see where people came from. 

Me too, and I agree, albeit my area voted Remain, but I understand the underlying rationale for why many people voted Leave even if the promises were too good to be true. 

I’ve tired to explain this to my overwhelmingly Remain-voting friends and family and I just get torn a new arsehole for even trying to understand Leave voters as anything other than moronic plebs. 

The fact of the matter is that there was also a heap of ignorance going on in Remain as well. I have the benefit of a legal education and I’m *au fait* with the EU law and its structure, but most Remainers I spoke with didn’t know very much about the EU at all despite championing it. Most strange of all were many of my left wing friends championing what amounted to a bloc designed to ease and co-ordinate international trade… when they spent the rest of their time attacking globalisation and international corps. Right.

And even if people want to view this purely as a war between Leave and Remain and not extend any empathy to Leave, not bothering to understand your ‘enemy’ *even though you lost to them* is surely not an especially wise thing. Remain not only lost, I’m not convinced most Remainers even learnt anything from this debacle beyond doubling down on the sneering elitism and complacency that alienated so many people in the first place. If your position is so good and commonsensical you have to have made at least a few mistakes to lose.    

The best approach IMO would be to embrace discontented Leavers and say ‘okay we all fucked up, but how about we fix this together?’ But even writing this it sounds hopelessly naive, if only because there’s still a surfeit of venomous bitter bastards on both sides which makes burying the hatchet and moving forward difficult",2024-02-01T14:35:03+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

unitedkingdom,comment,eu membership,eh1dsu0,Simon_Drake,,"No, I wouldn't be happy for an ambulance driver that only had training and qualifications from India.

Because we know the standards of driving in India and Britain are different, the road signs and traffic lights are different and the driving test itself is different (Rumour has it in some provinces of India you can get your driver's licence by mail order without even doing a test.). So an ambulance driver or even a regular person with a civilian drivers licence shouldn't be able to drive in Britain with just his Indian driver's licence as proof of his/her skills. This does work for drivers in Essex driving in Hertfordshire because they share the same test and certification process and assessment standards so the licence works across both regions.

So lets say an English Doctor wants to move to Latveria (The European country Victor Von Doom is from, Latveria is not part of the EU to my knowledge) and wants to be able to drive and continue his career as a doctor.   
Someone would need to assess if his UK driver's licence is still valid for driving in Latveria.  
Someone would need to assess if his UK medical degree and current membership of Royal College Of Physicians is still valid for doctoring in Laveria.

This could be done on the border but that's open to abuse.   
This could be decided case-by-case by the DVLA and Latverian Automobile Licencing Authority (LALA) but that's a lot of paperwork per person and that's just for driving. Reviewing if he's allowed to continue as a doctor would be a lot more complex.  
Therefore (IMHO) the best approach is for UK and Latveria to negotiate an agreement defining if their licences are interchangable.  They decide that the UK Drivers Licence/Test covers everything in the Latverian Driver's Licence/Test but not the other way around, Latverian citizens have to pass a special top-up training/test that covers safe use of the hard shoulder and driving in snow. This is a pain so Latveria updates their driving test to include these features and anyone that passes their test in Latveria after 2008 is able to drive in the UK immediately.  
The inverse happens for the medical licence, Latveria has a lot of infectious diseases and neurological conditions that don't exist in the UK (Victor Von Doom's experiments have serious side effects on the population and divert much needed funds away from vaccination programs) so a UK medical licence isn't valid in Latveria.

Obviously this is a simple example and real international politics takes years/decades and is far more complex than this. But I think ultimately this is the purpose of international organisations that promote harmony and standardisation like the ISO and the EU and IUPAC and IEEE and WHO and the UN. 

My point is that it's not an easy task to arrange these deals but leaving the EU is not a path to solving these problems.",2019-02-22T16:23:11+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

unitedkingdom,comment,europe,id046gt,Excellent_Plant1667,,"> Russia invaded Ukraine, that's it in terms of blame.. There is no justification for that.

Considering Russia has presented credible reasons for invoking article 51 of the UN charter, and provided detailed reasons 
on the subject of preemptive collective self-defense, I'd state the operation was justified. If you want to ignore the evidence, that's your prerogative. 

> They are arming Ukraine, and the US/NATO aren't who Russia need to be talking to, that, again, would be Ukraine. But frankly it seems unlikely that there is much point in engaging there as it seems far from likely that Russia would agree to withdraw.

Yes, they're continuing to arm Ukraine, which has a huge problem with Nazism; a subject which was highly documented pre-conflict. The US/West are culpable in arming neo-Nazis, who have in return been using human shields, targeting civilian infrastructure, and carrying out war crimes. It's sickening, and the US continues to expose its warmongering nature.
Do you really believe Ukraine/Zelensky is calling the shots?! They're  simply a puppet state for the US, it's clear as day who's making the decisions.

> No, I haven't regurgitated any Russian propaganda.. And there is no reason to is there? Russia invaded Ukraine, after annexing bits of it almost a decade before. That's entirely on Russia and Russia will end up paying for that.

So stating facts and evidence, equals 'Russian propaganda'?

> Cancel culture? discrimination and xenophobia toward Russians? Come on. When you go and invade a neighbor because you think it might mean you can regain some regional influence, and it all goes to tits, I'd expect some push back. Russia isn't the USSR, it isn't a superpower anymore and hasn't been for decades, it's barely a regional power at this point, but it's trying to act as though it has a right to dictate to its neighbours.

Yes, this hive mentality in demonizing and vilifying Russians is despicable. Again, you seem to be of the opinion that Russia just decided to 'invade' Ukraine because it could. Putin has no intention of taking all of Ukraine, his objectives were known from the outset, primarily defending the Donbas. If you're going to actively ignore the reasons for the operation, without referring to unbiased sources, then you clearly have no appetite for the truth or facts.

> And that brings us back to the UK position really, the UK's security interests rely on a secure Europe. Russia taking the piss and invading countries on its borders when it gets a bit annoyed undermines that. So the UK will continue to support Ukraine and oppose Russian policy in Europe (and elsewhere). And that's not a scenario that Russia is likely to win, at best it continues its downward spiral, at worst we have to deal with the collapse that was so close when the USSR fell apart.

Russia has made its security concerns known time and again. It's clear the US has no interest in diplomacy or maintaining peace with Russia; it's a warmongering nation which exists to oppose and provocate Russia.
The UK/NATO allies need to grow a spine and distance themselves from the US. The US really has a habit of waging illegal wars, violating international law and creating carnage, look no further than Iraq, Libya, Vietnam, Yugoslavia, Syria, Panama.

unitedkingdom,comment,eurozone,cki138j,BrokeMyFinger,,"Well the reply of ""scare-mongering"", which is a simplistic term, is usually to counter equally simplistic terms such as ""financial chaos"".

A ""yes"" vote is for Scotland to be independent, there are a chain of decisions and negotiations that happen before the above scenario plays out.

These would be, as I see it, as follows:

* A ""yes"" vote : decision made by people resident in Scotland

* A refusal of a currency union : a decision not made by people resident in Scotland (but they are aware that this is the intention in the event of a ""yes"" vote.)

* The national debt. As this is inextricably tied to the currency and this decision has been made as part of the previous one. However, Scotland could take on some of this as part of the negotiations. I can't see any incentive to take it on given the refusal of a currency union.

* The negotiations over oil. '""The Geneva agreement on natural resources under the sea dictates that they are divided by the median lines. Most people accept that the Geneva approach is the standard approach. Which gives Scotland 91% of revenues."" -National Institute of Economic and Social Research' I expect this will follow international convention and the debate around this issue seems to be about how much oil there is rather than how much of it Scotland will get.

My reading of this is that if Scotland wants to be independent, then the rest of the UK could try to inflict a credit squeeze on Scotland, but why would they be motivated to do this?

If nations didn't become independent due to the uncertainty it would cause in financial markets, and the risk of their credit rating, then we would still have the full British Empire, which was an awful thing.

Also, on the issue of credit, the above was written by a journalist, but:

""Standard & Poor’s released a report yesterday, clearly stating that an independent Scotland would be an investment grade economy.""

unitedkingdom,comment,freedom movement,clwjc7d,boq,,"What's the point of your text dump? /u/JB_UK shows that the number of people in relation to the existing population is not extraordinary in the UK, despite English being widely spoken. Your text doesn't refute that *in the slightest*, only gives irrelevant extra information. But let's go through it.

> Well Lux in basically a non entity of a country, let's be honest. Probably German/Belgian/French expats. It has a population the size of Brighton - 500,000.

So? Does Luxembourg's infrastructure handle the extra people through magic? No, by investing in it so it can deal with the extra population. This is a pointless addition from you.

> Cyprus .. I presume that's because half the country is divided and Turks are living in the north. The rest are probably wealthy retired Brits with summer properties. Population is the same a Birmingham, 1M.

You presume, wow. ""Probably,"" yeah. Thanks for not misleading us as much as the comment you are responding to!!1 ...pointless, again.

> Next up, Latvia and Estonia. These are basically fully assimilated 3rd/4th/5th generation Russians, who decided to keep their Russian citizenship after the Soviet Union was dissolved. They aren't really migrants.

You have provided no source and even if you had, one of the points of the anti-immigration believers is that culture and language is such a big deal. Evidently keeping their Russian passports, culture and language after generations would be considered a problem by them, so how come it's not a problem in the Baltic states? You know, the same Baltic states that are under threat from Russia because of that same minority. Hypocrisy.

> Now, Ireland - a sparsely populated country which probably has lots of NI/UK passport holders living there through family connections. Some Eastern European people too. OK. Population 1/10th of the UK.

So? What's with the sparse population comment? You think migrants come to Ireland and build houses in the forest? No, they move to urban areas. Even if they didn't infrastructure still needs to keep up, regardless of where exactly they live. Pointless, again.

> Austria - they're German with a few ex-Yugoslav migrants and Turks. This is the largest country of the list so far, with a population of about 8 million (London - or 14% of the UK)

So... what? Pointless, again. But just to humour you, you do realise that the south of Austria, the biggest part by far, is mountainous and the people cram themselves into the lowlands in the north? See the map I posted below.

> Now, Belgium. Historically a divided country, there'll be a Dutch and French passport holders everywhere, with a few non-EU nationals. A densely populated country. 

Okay, maybe, so... what?

> Spain has 6 million foreign-born people living there most are from Romania, Morocco, the UK and south America. They have a pop of 45M but roughly a third of the population density that the UK does at 240.

Again the population density. As if empty countries held infrastructure just waiting to be used (and, of course, as if immigrants moved into empty areas instead of urban ones). Again neglecting the constantly repeated ""culture"" argument that should apply here as well.



> The only comparable country on this chart you've provided is Germany, with what looks like a 6% non-national population (Turks i'm guessing) and a few % EU (Brits, Poles, French I suppose). BUT, while Germany has a higher population (80M) and a higher area (357km2), the UK is 65M/242km2, you must remember that the spread of population is fairly even all over Germany. Pretty much all of their land is habitable and comfortable and the wealth is spread evenly. Now Scotland, Wales and N.I make up 48% of the area of the UK, but they are not taking an even share of migrants, the majority are in England, which has a area of 130km2. And on top of that, most are in the southern because the north is economically depressed. No immigrant is settling in the Scottish highlands, Scotland has had a natural not artificial rise in population over the last 100 years. This is a key factor which the graph ignores. Wales has no industry and attracts no migrants. NI has almost none, it's 98.5% white British as of the 2011 census.

Isn't it weird how you can make all these detailed considerations when it comes to the UK, but not to all the other countries? So here's some reality: Germany is [not equally populated](http://i.imgur.com/4xeek.jpg). You'll find that West Germany, which is part of the Blue Banana together with England, has a comparable population density. And again, infrastructure has to accommodate a population, and that doesn't depend on density so much. When it does, it does on the contrary – it's easier to provide for people who live close to each other. Dig up a street in Dortmund, lay some fibre optics, thousands of people get fast internet. Do the same work in the middle of nowhere and maybe you can connect up a few houses.

That is politics in a nutshell. The goal is to be elected, not to do good things (though conveniently for the public, those two occasionally are the same).

In cases where something bad is to happen, then best thing for politicians is to A) make sure it doesn't happen when you are in power, and B) blame the opposition. The end result being your party is more likely to be elected.

When people suggest that a benevolent dictator is an ideal way to go, this is why. Said dictator is not consumed by the short-time horizons and need for re-election, and hence would actually solve the problem.

unitedkingdom,comment,passport,guy5rgo,tofunirvana,,"Because vaccines are not 100% effective on an individual level. They help a *lot,* don't get me wrong, but they don't make you completely immune to the virus. The largest benefit of vaccines comes from herd immunity where so many people are vaccinated that the disease can no longer spread (i.e. it makes the R number negative).

I don't support people being forced to have the vaccine, however, we need to stop viewing having the vaccine as only affecting you personally. If you choose not to have a vaccine, you are endangering people around you (not just yourself). So I don't think it's completely unreasonable that these people shouldn't be allowed to enter certain busy, public spaces.

Any sort of Labour win would require a massive swing, not just a majority.

> According to electionpolling.co.uk, to win the 124 seats required to achieve an overall ‘majority of one’ Labour will need a swing of 10.52% — larger than the uniform 10.2% that Tony Blair achieved in 1997 — and contrary to popular belief — around five times more than the 2% that Jeremy Corbyn achieved in 2017. If Labour can’t manage to break back into Scotland then — after taking Scottish seats out of the equation — they will need a swing of a 13.8% — greater than the overall shift in support that Labour achieved in the famous 1945 election — to form a majority government.

Any property built that is adapted for disability access (ie, an access ramp) is not available to buy from my local council. So make every new property have disabled access. No change to existing laws required.

Social housing is rent controlled. If there's a huge supply of flats and houses in an area for £400 a month rent with plenty of vacancies, no private landlord is going to be able to charge £1,000 a month because people will choose the council owned properties instead.

This is basic supply and demand.

We have seen so many articles lately where nurses and police officers are having to use food banks. And I can guarantee you that they are using food banks because all of their money is going on rent.

The Tories seem to be doing everything they can to sell off the existing council properties to reduce supply. They are even extending the right to buy scheme to other private social housing companies, but that discount comes from your local council, which means the local council has to sell off even more properties to fund it.

unitedkingdom,post,sovereignty,cz47kj,Evis03,HS2 delayed again.,"HS2 suffered another severe delay in the neo sub Parliament today. Arriving at the PeekHam site via matter transference beam, members of the Ministry of Intra Dimensional Transport met for a rare face to face briefing, as opposed to the more typical telepath presence facilitated by their brain implants.

Addressing the state's central AI facilitator, Britannia, Dahnu Fomhas Smiff, regretted that the long troubled rail project has again hit delays and may take a further three to four orbits, as well as an extra three billion Sovereignty bits Sterling to complete.

Asked to explain this delay building contractors claimed that continued uncertainty over Brexit was making it difficult to secure the needed materials from the EU's colony at Utopia Planitia, the only place where further extraction of pre meta material elements such as iron remains economically viable.

The beleaguered project has been facing difficulties for quite a while, with successive governments claiming that too much has been spent to abandon the project, and that with only a few more billion it will be completed. However earlier this year the project marked an important milestone in its construction with T'marok Rt'nkicht symbolically moving the very first shovel of earth in a grand, psychobroadcasted ceremony. Progress has since stalled.

Opposition leaders continue to criticise the government over HS2 spending, and highlight that funds might be better spent expanding the matter transference beam system to anywhere outside of the London hive. The prime minister dismissed these claims, saying that HS2 would provide economical if not immediate transport for those on the edges of the London Sprawl. Total costs of the project are hard to estimate given the range of economic and social circumstances which have elapsed since its inception Pre Homo Novis, as well as the difficulties in converting old style fiat currency to modern econlink currencies. Conservative estimates put the total costs at around 30,000 billion SbS.

unitedkingdom,comment,ttip,cmdsenm,vomausland,,"I attended a TTIP conference in Berlin today with experts both for and against from the EU, unions and ministries. Here's my summary: 

- There are a ton of myths or inaccuracies going round. No wonder - a BIG problem that everyone agreed with is that there has been a terrible lack of public communication with what TTIP is along with the advantages and disadvantages. 

- The negotiations are in secret. However, the draft agreement will not be secret. Once that is in place, everyone can look at it and complain about it being unfair if they like. Either way, the USA will not publish their proposals until they have developed them. It means we (the public and our representatives) cannot yet react as we don't know what we're reacting to. One concern is that there will be a rush after the publication of the drafts to make a decision on the agreement before the US presidential election, otherwise negotiations will stall.

- Another big problem is trying to find concordance between all of the EU states. After all, this isn't a British agreement or a German agreement with America. Which standards do we keep for ourselves and which do we ""harmonise""? Some things in the EU aren't clearly defined. What constitutes ""culture"", for example, when we want to decide what is left in and what is left out of TTIP? There is no clear legal or political definition for this within the EU, so how can we even negotiate on it? An area which interests me is audiovisual media, which are specifically to be left out of TTIP (for now at least!)... but what will count as A/V and what will be branded as 'telecommunications'? Similarly, each state decides what counts as a 'public service', so it is difficult to have a single overview of the affect on the EU as a whole in this area.

- While the break up of some general-interest service provisions (public services) will mean more competitiveness and more jobs, it was argued that these jobs will be a race to the bottom in terms of pay and conditions. It was argued that, if a government chooses to privatise, say, the provision of electricity then it WOULD be difficult to back out... but it would be through normal means of a court case and compensation, just as any normal legal contract may require. 

- However, an (some?) adjudication board(s?) would be in charge of disputes within the TTIP zone. Should we give so much power over what we are allowed to do with our own country's resources up to one panel of a few people? It was argued that adjudication panels already operate between our countries on trade issues, across several industries all the time without any fuss being kicked up.

- Huge trade agreements are normal in our increasingly globalised world - just look at the partnerships in Asia, Pacific, Americas etc. If we want to keep to ourselves on an EU level, or worse, on a national level, we will lose some very profitable opportunities for growth creation. Essentially, the EU could be playing catchup and we will lose some of our bargaining power when it comes to intercontinental trade. It's our way of protecting ourselves for the future. 

- A lot of people would like to wait and see how CETA comes along (EU-Canada trade agreement) in order to provide a blueprint for TTIP. We shouldn't think of ""TTIP is great/evil"", but rather ""how can we use this opportunity to improve life and business in the EU?"". 

It all comes down to this: negotiations are always give and take. Is what we would get worth what we would have to give up?

Either way, we MUST inform ourselves. And the EU MUST provide us with more information in a clear, digestible format in order for us, as citizens of the European Union, to decide if we are for or against. 

Edit: To address the article - ""The report finds that... Canada has faced 35 claims worth billions of dollars as a result of cases being brought by US transnationals [as part of the NAFTA trade agreement]. It’s already lost over $175 million, but this could be the tip of the iceberg, as companies are suing Canada for such crimes as revoking drilling permits, subsidising renewable energy, placing a moratorium on fracking, questioning pharmaceutical patents, banning toxic additives in petrol and placing a temporary ban on the export of toxic waste.""

$175 million is nothing over the course of 20 years, considering the deal is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Also, if your company suddenly had your drilling permit removed after you had invested millions upon the past approval or a drug you had developed was unreasonably banned, wouldn't you want to be able to sue the government to fight your case? ""Banning toxic additives in petrol"" is weasly phrasing - who is claiming they are toxic? With what proof and using good scientific methods? And shouldn't a company be able to claim money if you suddenly change your mind about a chemical? 

TTIP DOES NOT force the NHS to be privatised! It just requires the government to stick to its word to the companies it hands NHS services to. If the government changes its mind or goes back on a contract, then of course they will sue the government. This already happens. However, the court would be a TTIP adjudicator... this part IS controversial.",2014-11-26T19:09:21+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,
