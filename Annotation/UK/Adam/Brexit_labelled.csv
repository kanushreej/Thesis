>The Scottish government proposed that all British citizens who had been born in Scotland would automatically become Scottish citizens on the date of independence, regardless of whether or not they were then living in Scotland. British citizens ""habitually resident"" in Scotland would also be considered Scottish citizens, even if they already held the citizenship of another country. Every person who would automatically be considered a Scottish citizen would be able to opt-out of Scottish citizenship provided they already held the citizenship of another country.[88] The Scottish government also proposed that anyone with a Scottish parent or grandparent would be able to apply for registration as a Scottish citizen, and any foreign national living in Scotland legally, or who had lived in Scotland for at least 10 years at any time and had an ongoing connection to Scotland, should be able to apply for naturalisation as a Scottish citizen.[88] UK Home Secretary Theresa May said the future policies of an independent Scottish government would affect whether Scottish citizens would be allowed to retain British citizenship.[89] An analysis paper published by the UK government in January 2014 stated that it was likely that Scots would be able to hold dual citizenship;[90] however, the duality was considered for all other countries, not specifically to the rest of the UK.

Scotland,comment,referendum,iyu4olq,Xenon009,,"So, Lost englishman here, so please don't shoot me, but:

Scotland has 2 ways out of the UK, A mutual agreement, or a Unilateral declaration of independence.

In the case of a mutual agreement, Westminster could pretty much take as much as they want from Holyrood, the alternative for Westminster is you not leaving... which they want. Essentially its bribing Westminster to let you go until Scotland is left with the question of ""Is independence really worth this price?""

The upside of that mutual agreement is that the rest of the world sees Scotland as a legitimate country.

A Unilateral declaration of independence on the other hand, means total isolation at best, or straight up war at worst. To unilaterally declare independence is to do an American revolution. Maybe Westminster would choose to fight, they would have every right to as far as the international community is concerned, and there would certainly be no UN support as the UK would just veto said support.

But more likely the UK would just refuse to accept Scottish independence, block any membership to the UN (and thus the EU, or any other trading partnership) and watch as the Scottish economy/society explodes till Holyrood wants back in, in a similar vein to Taiwan and the PRC, just without any US aid, leaving Scotland the choice to become best mates with russia/china, or be alone.

Needless to say, the declaration of independence is a really, REALLY bad idea, which means Westminster holds all the leverage.",2022-12-04T04:21:11+00:00,t1_iyt14cd,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

unitedkingdom,comment,Farage,fthd2c9,IFeelRomantic,,"Let me help you: stop worrying about what the far-right do.

There's far too much hand-wringing among the left about ""oh god how will this *look* to people"", and honestly ... no matter what you do, you'll never win that game. People don't support the far-right because someone in a mass protest tried to burn a flag. They just use that excuse to try and get the left to stop doing anything out of fear of ""turning people against us"". Those people on your Facebook were never going to support fighting racism here just because they posted a #blackouttuesday pic.

It doesn't matter if it's burning a flag, they'll point to literally anything to give themselves an excuse for why we shouldn't support change. Climate change protesters were ""turning people against the cause"" for blocking a road. The left were ""turning people against the cause"" by throwing a milkshake at Farage. And remember how everyone was acting when Extinction Rebellion dug up a garden at an Oxford Uni? ""You're playing into the hands of your opponents"" we're told, every time.

Ultimately, it's a fucked if you do and fucked if you don't situation. If you do nothing, they'll keep ignoring the systemic racism issues in the country. If you do something, they'll find whatever they can to say that you're the real problem. Just don't play that game.",2020-06-09T15:02:19+00:00,t3_gzn31p,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don’t attend there or anywhere else because I’m basically an agnostic, but here’s the point:

After the main service is over, they have an Español service for the large Latino community in our area. They run food banks, they run free medical clinics, they buy and donate school supplies to poor families, they buy and donate winter clothing, the list goes on and on and on. If it weren’t for that church there’d be a heck of a lot of poor people in our area that would be going without.

The same people that are spending their time and money volunteering at that church also vote Republican. Jesus said “Help your neighbor.” He did not say “Tax your neighbor, transfer the money to an inefficient federal bureaucracy, and then use that money to pay a bureaucrat to help your neighbor.” Those church members help their neighbors.

One of my pet peeves is political progressives thumbing their noses up at churches and religious conservatives using the same sort of rhetoric that you did, while claiming moral superiority because they…vote a certain way.

Maybe. Depends on the substance of the deal.

Not quite. What I'm asking for is a referendum where people are given a free choice. I would be no more comfortable with a referendum which is ""our deal/remain"" only than one which is ""our deal/no deal"" only. The point of including all 3 options is that it more closely adheres to a fundamental principle of democratic choice - that being that even if a group of voters don't like the *outcome* of the vote, they can agree that the *process* is fair at least. With the referendum offer as it stands, the process is categorically *not* fair. The question is incomplete.",2019-09-25T16:26:58+00:00,t1_f1eluc2,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ultimately, to get more money into things they want to generate more money in the mid term, rather than be held hostage by the same tax-and-spend sticking plaster traps the Tories have.

AskUK,comment,Labour,fanls07,abz_eng,,"> And even if it becomes more efficient due to the free market (dubious at best) where do you think the saved cash will go? Back in to the system or in to the pockets of share holders and senior managers?

Actually for efficiency/cost it needs very careful management 

I seen where outsourcing certain functions for certain industries work. I also seen where companies/organisations   can be taken for a ride.

Non core functions with extremely clearly defined functions work great as an outsource.  Take payroll or pensions or accounting for a *manufacturing* business.  

You can define that the outsourcer is responsible for accounts processing, bill paying and allocating expenses to cost centres. 

Where the outsourcer can drive cost saving is by reducing empire building. I know of a place that lost 20%+ of head count with no loss of service, due to empire building in former nationalised company. That was because the core business, did not have a full understanding of the numbers required for the non core business, thus the head of the area was allowed to expand the headcount and appeared more important.

Sad but true.

Where it goes wrong is the likes of PFI where the changes are a normal part of operations over time are charged at an exorbitant amount. Or the consumables supplier is not challengeable. 

The NHS has crazy rules on procurement at present. I know this as I've seen quotes.  A charity wanted to buy specialised chairs  for the ward associated with the charities aims. They were able to go to the supplier/manufacture and get a price - no VAT as charity. But the NHS wasn't allowed to accept them, rather they would take the money and buy the chairs from their approved supplier and pay VAT (HMRC rules as a visitor could sit in the chair). The ex VAT price was higher   as the supplier added a margin. There there was the VAT.  The Charity couldn't buy as many chairs as they wanted to.

The OECD and EU measure material living standards using Actual Individual Consumption. It's a measure of the goods and services consumed by households, whether through their own purchases or provided by government (eg health and education). It's measured by volume, so already includes price adjustments.

The OECD figures go up to 2020, but the 2020 figures are of course affected by lockdown. The 2019 figures for the top 10 as a percentage of the OECD average:

|United States|154|

|Switzerland|115|

https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/national-accounts-of-oecd-countries/volume-2022/issue-1\_de01f0c1-en#page31

Not really, unless those improvements are material and tangible. Given they have provided scant indication as to how they will improve things this is all very hypothetical... Which is part of the problem.

>You're asking for an alternative policy to this one, but this one is actually not a bad policy to begin with; it just needs fine-tuning. 

No, I am asking why they never had a policy around this area to begin with. In fact they seem very scant in respect to details on any material policy. Which is the point being made.
Did the Tories introduce universal healthcare during the last 14 years? If not your point is irrelevant. This wasn't a policy that has been trudging along for years and years this was released within the last year.
The fundamental issue is that Labour are incredibly light on policy and despite repeated asks no one has been able to provide any material details on their childcare policies outside of a breakfast club.

>They have stated that the policy isn't fit for purpose and are looking to reform it.

It's great that both Labour and yourself are happy to be behind the Tories in respect to childcare policy. Not like it's a policy that has a profound impact on young adults or anything. The point being that an election could be called at any minute and a major policy area has just been left for the incumbents to determine. Which means if labour copy it any way, the conservatives will rightly ridicule them for it.

>14 years of Tory Government, Brexit etc... yeah I stand by that statement

Congratulations on missing the point.
Firstly only about 25% of the country supported the Tories it is a design of the FPTP system.
Secondly brexit occurred due to prolonged government and media blaming the EU and the refusal of the pro EU camps engaging in positive campaigning. 

>It was a single example of something that was touted by Labour and then picked up by Tories (and then presented as a Rishi Special). Other examples include [an energy price cap, a windfall tax on energy companies, and raising state benefits in line with inflation

All of which resulted in humiliating walk backs for the government and resulted in them getting a pasting because it... Which backs my point far more than yours.

>With all due respect, this is just axe grinding.

I appreciate where you're coming from but this isn't just me continued polling demonstrates that people aren't overly satisfied with labours overall offering and it comes from a position that they are either promoting themselves as competent Tories or bereft of any actual policy ideas.

---


I am fascinated by how quickly the debate about immigration has defaulted to ruminations about love.

Is loving somebody from a foreign land to become only the preserve of the rich? What if you lose your heart to a hottie whose earnings fall short of £38,700, the required salary for a work permit?

We seem set for a general election campaign next year in which the immigration argument will centre on how to blunt Cupid’s arrows.

So far this has been discussed almost entirely as a UK matter. Immigration is, after all, a power wholly reserved to Westminster. But could Scotland provide hope for star-crossed young lovers?
Possibly. This time next year a Labour government could well be introducing a distinct immigration policy for Scotland. If so, what might it look like?

The SNP view on Scottish immigration is simple: Scotland should be an independent country and have its own arrangements on who gets to live here. Last month Shirley-Anne Somerville, cabinet secretary for social justice, published a 64-page paper on immigration as part of a Scottish government series on how independence would work.

Perhaps inevitably, the paper failed to adequately explain how Scotland could have an open border with both the European Union and Brexit England. And with the prospect of independence looking somewhat remote, to say the least, what about the here and now?
The interim SNP solution is for Westminster to devolve immigration powers to Holyrood in their entirety, blithely ignoring the not-unreasonable objection that a UK government might want some control over UK borders.

Anas Sarwar, leader of Scottish Labour, was recently challenged on why immigration powers should not be devolved. “On immigration, I think it’s right for us to have a single border agency, I think it’s right for us to have a single immigration system,” he said. “But we’ve seen before, when two governments are willing to co-operate, you can find schemes that benefit us here in Scotland to meet our specific needs.”
Sarwar was talking about an initiative called Fresh Talent, introduced by Jack McConnell when he was Labour first minister of Scotland almost 20 years ago.

McConnell had become concerned about three things he felt were holding back the Scottish economy. First, the Scottish population was ageing more quickly than the rest of the UK. Second, the Scottish population over many years had been shrinking as young Scots sought adventure and prosperity elsewhere. And third, immigrants to the UK were more likely to settle in England than in Scotland.

McConnell’s solution, negotiated with the Home Office, was to allow overseas students in Scotland to stay on for two years after graduation without work permits. The scheme started in 2005 but foundered shortly after the SNP came to power in 2007 as relations between Edinburgh and London soured.

For Sarwar, Fresh Talent is the Goldilocks solution: not too nationalist, not too unionist. “A Scottish solution to a Scottish problem, while maintaining a UK-wide immigration system and a UK-wide border agency,” is how he described it.

Could Scotland go further? Gordon Brown’s “A New Britain” blueprint, published in December last year, talked up the need for UK decisions on immigration to take account of specific needs in the Scottish workforce. Could a points-based immigration system reflect this?

The usual objection to such tinkering was its lack of safeguards. Someone using a sweetheart deal to come to Scotland could just jump on the next train to Kings Cross, never to be seen north of the border again.

That was then. Now, thanks to the Smith Commission enhancements to devolution, Scotland has its own system of income tax. The personal tax code of every person working in Scotland includes a capital letter “S”. This is easily checked by the authorities. Therefore it is possible to grant a work permit that allows only employment in Scotland.

Further checks would be possible if Sir Keir Starmer embraced an idea floated earlier this year by William Hague and Tony Blair, writing jointly in The Times. “We advocate reorganising the centre of Whitehall to drive the use of data and AI across government, including digital ID for every citizen,” they wrote.

Last time Britain had a proper debate about ID cards was when Labour was last in power and Alan Johnson was home secretary. Amid much wailing and gnashing of teeth, enabling legislation was passed in 2006. It was later repealed by the Tory-led coalition in 2010.

Since then attitudes to digital surveillance have changed. Google and Facebook track every step we take, every pound we spend and every topic we search for online. Data is predicted to transform health, education, productivity and prosperity. Are ID cards really as controversial today as they were almost two decades ago, when we were still using dial-up modems and the iPhone was just a twinkle in Steve Jobs’s eye?

Last year Stephen Kinnock, as a junior shadow Home Office minister, floated the possibility that Labour might look again at ID cards. He was swiftly closed down by Yvette Cooper, his boss. Might this position change when a general election looms, or once Labour is in power? We will see.

Is there hope, then, for Scotland’s star-crossed lovers? Our young Romeos and Juliets can only hold their breath.",2023-12-06T14:18:37+00:00,t3_18c4jav,,,,,,,,,,,,

This means, that for any drastic change that a government cannot do alone, which requires parliamentary vote, needs a defacto majority of representatives, voted for by a true majority of the people, to be able to enact the change.

This means, that single party politics cannot take over the agenda of the country when each term changes. This leads to political stability, predictive authorities and prosperity for the country as a whole, when enacted changes truely are done for the people, by the people. 

Strong majority governments from FPTP systems as we see examples of time and time again, are in the long run unstable, not prosperous for the people but the few individuals, and usually enact changes that are flipped every 4 years, but some of these changes are irreversible, harming the country for potentially decades to come.
