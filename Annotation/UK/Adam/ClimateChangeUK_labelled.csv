LabourUK,comment,environment,e56l77y,redteddy23,,"That's interesting thanks for the reply. I remember reading Chomsky when I was an undergrad but as engineering student I had enough to worry about. I think I got the gist and he has produced a powerful body of work that was part of recognising the terrible actions of the US and saying you cannot just sweep away crimes carried out in the name of theoretical good.


The thing is I really think the theoretical and ideological differences are important and judgements based solely on a score sheet remove all historical context in terms of culture, technology, economics, geography and well everything. Usually when people say this it is a red flag for some kind of apology or revisionism I know. However, when we just pile up death counts and crimes then a ranking of the most evil men in history is made and roll up roll up we have Mao an the top! Followed by Stalin! Only then Hitler! Maybe Genghis Khan follows! Then Queen Victoria with her Indian Famines! See Communism is the worst and imperialism not so bad. This is the kind of nonsense that gets you a popular youtube channel but it is not history. I know Chomsky is not literally saying this and his argument is more simple: that crimes and murder by the state are always crimes and murder. However horrible actions by one state can usually only be stopped by horrible actions by another and at the end of the day the potential evil that has been stopped cannot be ignored.


The post-war Labour government made up of some pretty imaginative men and women but they were products of their time. I do not know much about the arguments took place in government regarding foreign policy but perhaps some argued for making Britain completely independent and neutral, freeing the empire and assisting those nations in remaining free of superpower inference. However, I find it difficult to condemn the decisions that was taken. That we were broke and to rebuild Britain we had to ally with the US. If you bought up the actions of the US historically Ernest Bevin would say that it was a great shame but at the moment we need US money to build the NHS and helping them out around the world is the price we pay.


Anyway thanks very much for trying to explain this to me I appreciate the effort.

AskUK,post,climate change,buerl1,1beatleforce1,21/m What are my options?,"Hi guys. 

So basically I have reached a point in my life where I really need a change. I did well through school until my GCSEs which I totally screwed for a variety of reasons. I left school at 16 with no qualifications, and I’ve spent the last 5 years directionless, hopping from one min wage job to the next, travelling, playing in a band, doing drugs and just generally fucking around. I currently live with my mum.

I’ve been working in a cash&carry for the last 6 months, and my life has totally stagnated around me. I have no social life as friends have all gone separate ways, I’ve been through some awful times mentally, but the dust is settling and I’ve started to realise things aren’t going to change without sorting out my education. 

I’m very interested in climate and weather, and would love to study environmental science or something similar. All the news on climate catastrophe is part of what has paralysed me recently, I want to study it further and try and help in any way I can, instead of it hanging over me causing crippling anxiety. 

Obviously I can’t just walk into a university with 0 quals, but I’m not actually stupid. I’m pretty academic, I’ve just made poor decisions and not fixed things when I’ve needed to. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What can I do now?

However, we recently moved out far away into a tiny studio which is really just an averagely sized bedroom with a kitchen counter. She remains inside. I think she misses the spaciousness of the old environment and often meows, particularly at night. I think it’s because she is trying to access the usual spaces she did in the family house but is annoyed by being unable to do so.

I feel bad for her when she meows and am considering getting a leash and taking her outside for a bit to allow her to fully exert her energy, run around and come back. But I have a few concerns:

- Outside addiction: once she gets the taste of outside, she will always want to go outside. And if she gets too comfortable with outside, my worry is that one day she might sneak out and run away and struggle to survive in an outdoor environment since she has been an indoor cat all her life. 

- prone to illness: her outside, even on a leash, she may eat or be be around toxic objects that might be harmful to her.

Solar is cheap, emissions free, has an unlimited fuel source and can be set up quickly but takes up loads of land and is rather poor in the UK even when conditions are optimal.

Wind is pretty similar to solar albeit slightly more expensive and better suited to the UK, also being able to build off shore means you're taking up less land.

I'd argue that those three technologies are superior as they emit nothing at all during production of electricity and are sustainable.

[Telegraph: Sunlight and fresh air can protect against coronavirus, Sage adviser tells MPs](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/13/sunlight-fresh-air-can-protect-against-coronavirus-sage-adviser/)

>Fresh air and sunshine are protective against coronavirus, one of the Government's chief scientific advisers has said.

>The decision to release some of the UK's lockdown restrictions, allowing people to spend more time outdoors, have faced criticism from those claiming that will reverse the benefits of lockdown and help spread the virus.

>On Wednesday, new rules came into effect, allowing people to exercise outdoors as much as they like and take part in sports such as golf, tennis and fishing. People can also meet up with one person from outside their household. 

>Giving evidence at the science and technology select committee, Professor Alan Penn, the chief scientific adviser at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said being outdoors will help prevent people from contracting the virus.

>""The science suggests that being outside in sunlight, with good ventilation, are both highly protective against transmission of the virus,” he told MPs.


>""The route of transmission comes in three main forms. It comes from droplets, which is where the two-metre rule comes in, because droplets fall to the ground within two metres to a high degree. It comes from aerosols which float around more but carry less virus, and the touching of objects.

>""The way Sage has judged the use of outside spaces is that this is one of the lowest-risk forms of activity.""

>Prof Penn was giving evidence following questions from Chris Clarkson, the MP for Heywood and Middleton, who said his local park had seen overcrowding.

>At the beginning of April, Brockwell Park, in south London, locked its gates after 3,000 people visited on a Saturday, many sunbathing or in large groups. 


>Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, also warned that ""sunbathing is against the rules"". He accused people of ""putting others' lives at risk"" and warned that outdoor exercise could be banned if people did not keep away from parks.

>But many scientists have pointed out that there is currently no evidence that coronavirus has ever been transmitted outdoors, while there is abundant evidence of indoor transmission.

>The decision to lift some restrictions is believed to have come following a report by Sage which suggested the risk of catching the virus outside is very small. 

>A Government source said: ""You're actually more likely to pick it up from surfaces and touch than you are by the spread of droplets in the air. 

>""Some viruses spread in the air literally as aerosolised things that go for relatively long distances, and as far as we know this isn't like that – it's relatively short distances and then falls onto surfaces.""

>Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine also said suspended particles of the virus would be massively diluted by fresh air, with the viral particles they contain rapidly destroyed by desiccation and UV light.",2020-05-14T09:14:36+00:00,t3_gjfprt,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scotland,post,warming,fpbi8,Devoured,Walking the West Highland Way in April and need some advice,"Hello scottish redditors! I am visiting your country in April from the 8th-22nd to hike the entirety of the West Highland Way. I thought making a post in this sub would be a smart move instead of just the general travel section as I will be exclusively focusing on Scotland. I have never been outside of North America and am unwise to the ways of the world.


**A few things I plan on doing:**

Flying in and out of Turnhouse in Edinburgh

Getting from Edinburgh to Glasgow via bus so I can start the way from Milngavie.

Taking rail service from Fort William to Edinburgh in order to get back with sufficient time to board my flight home.

Exchanging a couple hundred $ for £ here in the states before I come over and just taking out more as needed by using credit card/debit card.

Staying at B&Bs, hostels and campsites along the WHW. I do not plan on carrying a tent.

Packing smart and concentrating on the stuff that will keep me warm and in the moment (I.E. not bringing a laptop, camera or other electronic distractions)

I have been using this small guidebook to help me with planning: [Rucksack Readers WHW](http://www.amazon.com/West-Highland-Way-2008/dp/189848130X/ref=pd_rhf_p_t_1)

**Questions I have:**

What is the weather typically like during that time of year? I only have a general idea of what to prepare for.

Does anyone have experience couchsurfing in Scotland? I plan on spending a few nights doing it.

Bear with me, this one is a bit embarrassing: As an east coast american-english speaker, will I have difficulty understanding you guys?

I have an unlocked smartphone. Will I be able to get a sim somewhere with some minutes/texts or even data on it? Using GPS if I somehow get lost would be fantastic.

What is it like to go through customs? What sort of questions will I be asked? How strict is the Scottish government with that sort of thing?

Does anyone have any experience with the Way or routes like it?

Im looking at this experience as a sort of a quick testing of the waters. I have always HEARD a lot of things about how Scotland is, but I think that all those ideas will be dispelled once I actually spend a few days there and find out first hand. Americans are fed a lot of BS through the lens of our media and I don't trust anyone else's version of how things are.

Thanks for reading. Any suggestions or criticisms are welcome. Don't be afraid to call me foolish for assuming something outlandish.

// **edit** 
For those of your wondering what sort of route I'm looking at doing: 
Milngavie -
Drymen -
Rowardennan -
Inverarnan -
Tyndrum - 
Inveroran -
Kingshouse -
Kinlochleven -
Fort William

I plan on climbing Ben Nevis as well.

// **edit 2**
Thanks to everyone for your input. I feel much better equipped to handle my upcoming journey. Yay for the International Reddit community!

Labour,post,climate,qv4mee,Adzm00,"So bored of dishonest framing of ""support the Labour party under Starmer""...","Just no. There are so many problems with this and its usually the same old liberal scabs that are coming out with this sort of nonsense, but it does seem as if a good old chunk of apparently left leaning people have been either duped by this or they are just so tired with the slog they've succumbed.

I am going to write a few pieces here but would also encourage anyone reading why it is imperative we do not lend our support to Starmers bunch of neoliberal wreckers.

Some of the most obvious reasons are this:

It legitimises the 5 years of attacks during Corbyns tenure by the right wing in the party and says to them ""you know what, if ever someone is too left wing, you can attack them constantly, you can demonise the membership, you can orchestrate resignations and walk-outs and coups, you can work with the media to brief against the party, you can use your political connections to business to have them speak against the party, and worse yet, you can make use of the security services and state apparatus in order to use taxpayer money to fund a campaign of misinformation in order to discredit them... and when you think you've done enough, you can weaponise the memory of millions of dead and use their horrific experience to attack the left.... 

...voting for Starmer, giving them your support says acting as I've set out above, as we know the right in Labour acted, is a-ok and next time you can do exactly the same again.

**Unacceptable.**

The other argument is ""anything but the tories"". The tories are simply an arm of the establishment, they are the political elite created to keep the plebs in check and make sure that the establishment rules and nothing can come by way of challenge.

And unfortunately this elitist rule over us (and elsewhere in the world) is really screwing us over on many fronts, probably the most pressing global issue which the elites running the place is climate change, we haven't acted and gone far enough simply due to political will.

Anyway as most of you on my side of the fence would say in response to this, there is no point electing the tories inside Labour and saying ""anything but the Tories"" as if it is meaningful. Because by doing this, not only are you legitmising the way they acted, but you also just entrench another set of establishment actors, and the issue is long term they might actually be more damaging.

See the thing with liberals and centrists is this, they are beyond dishonest, they are the biggest bunch of slimy lying scabs going, they are worse than snakes and they will say anything to get what they want. Liberal politicians in the blair years is what sent the image of political integrity among the public into the dirt, these people since then have been seen to be nothing but dishonest and in it for themselves and that is because their dishonesty eventually becomes apparent.

But there is one thing about the centrists/liberals/labour right wing, they are pretty good at being dishonest, and not because they are personally good at it, because they are incompetent across the board, but that they have the media establishment in their hand means their lies can be amplified and repeated time after time and the public start believing it.

Now its no secret starmer dropped all his pledges he had to get elected, he is a poor politician and he is a blatantly dishonest servant of the establishment. I think it has shocked other libs just how bad he is, but he was elected and pushed for by the establishment to be in place for when Johnson and his brexit became too toxic, so just like when the Tories became too toxic under Major, when the time for change is there, the risk to the establishment is void.

And the reason why I say it is potentially more dangerous and why I outlined just how dishonest these people are is that many of the issues we face require a pretty drastic intervention, climate change being the obvious one, but all you will get from these people is small changes which their establishment media pals will laud as some bold strategy and the issue with this is it makes the change we need on the scale we need much more difficult to achieve in the timeframe we have.

People are like ""oh its not that bad, its moving the right way"" and when they eventually get done with the liberals Labour party and the establishment want the Tories back, the people haven't been sufficiently fucked over in large enough numbers to be fed up and the Tories will be back in.

The problem here is time, if we fail to act on things like climate change and fail to show global leadership in tackling these issues, then these issues are going to bite all of us (but not the establishment) and people will be getting fucked for decades after because they aren't problems which are solved overnight.

&#x200B;

These are just two of the issues we face by backing the right wing scabs that are currently at the top of the Labour party.

So when you ask us to support them, the answer is now and will always be not a chance.",2021-11-16T10:09:55+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originally it was even one of the key criterias where CO2 should be taxed:

- pumping at oil well: where the trouble starts

- producer: they can pick how to produce it and he emits it

- consumer: they order it and they can pick alternatives and curb competition

- value increase: those who increase the product value by each step of refinement shall pay (like banks)

northernireland,comment,coal,hvzkmol,masjon,,"I used to live next to a traveller camp for approx 12 years. Can honestly say that I never had a positive experience with them. One actually kicked my dog as we walked past the local pub (he was outside smoking). World war three broke out when I punched him and i got leathered by about 4 of them who had come out to see what was happening. I was more worried about my wife and dog but luckily they were fine. 

Had my work van windows smashed by a gang of them who were coming back from a night out. I watched them do it but was fuck all I could do as I was on my own besides my wife and kids. They then proceeded to throw a beer bottle through a living room window of one of our neighbours across the road. (Just to add, this was completely unrelated to the incident with my dog, it was years later. They were smashing up cars and stuff for no reason along the street). 

They were always intimidating tony, the old guy who owned the local chippy, into giving them free food. Used to go in in a crowd of around 20. 

Took the kids out for tea in the local Toby carvary, and a gang of travellers started setting off fireworks inside the restaurant amd one did a shit on the floor 😂. Really scared a lot of people including adults. 

The local pubs had to close whenever there was a traveller funeral as the travellers would literally smash up every pub in the town centre without fail every single time causing 10s of thousands of pounds worth of damage . That still applies today with the pubs closing whenever they get word of a traveller funeral. 

I could go on forever here. I keep remembering different things lol.

My advise is to bring your driving instructor with you. During my test my examiner was rude and dismissive of me. At one point during my test he sat back in his seat with their eyes closed as the sun was apparently to bright for their eyes. They also made rude comments during my test. When I filed a complaint about this of course they denied it all. Claimed it was raining that morning and they never done it. They had no need to be doing it. Yet it was a sunny day with blinding sun, no rain and a temperature of 12 degrees. I of course failed my test that day, the town was very busy and when even questioned about that they said the town was quite, there was no traffic on any of the roads I was doing my test on. Like seriously its Cookstown the main town is always busy and it was a Friday also. 

So keep yourselves right, if you can't bring your instructor then find a way to reckord your test. Then you will have evidence of how they treat people during their exams.

**Who is Matthew Paterson?**  Matthew Paterson (u/SuitableFormal5852) is Professor of International Politics, and Director of the Sustainable Consumption Institute, at the University of Manchester. He has worked on climate change politics for over thirty years, focused on a range of political forces that both hold back and sometimes drive forward action on climate change, including the power of large corporations, the tensions between economic growth and climate policy, the legacy of free market ideologies, and the disruptions to daily life that effective climate change responses involve. Recent work has focused on the backlash against ‘net zero’ in the UK, and at the moment he is working on the impacts of the COVID/inflation/Ukraine crises on climate policy action in various countries, including the UK, and is writing an essay on the legacy of the 1984-5 miners’ strike for the UK’s climate leadership.

The strongholds are very important because if they see that their base is slipping they will amend their policies to reflect that. Let's say somehow that constituency went from 90% tory to 85% tory (with the 5% going to green let's say) and that reflected a greater trend in the country then you can be damned sure that the conservatives would at least pay lip service to policies that are starting to take away from them. For christ's sake UKIP had the third biggest vote share in 2015, they won ONE seat. Nine other parties got more seats than them, yet what has been the biggest political issue since then? Why did we have a referendum in the first place?


Sure those UKIP voters would definitely have been happier with Farage in Charge but you can't tell me that voting for a party that is guaranteed to not win doesn't make a difference.


I don't contest that other voting systems are better and more direct. I do contest that a vote for a party that ""isn't going to win"" is completely a wasted vote. They are still absolutely taken into consideration. Obviously the winner takes all but if they see the tides turning they absolutely to change their tune to cling on.

ukpolitics,comment,coal,ep0tus5,alyssas,,"Nope. In the mid 1980's it was 100% coal. Then Thatcher started the process of switching coal power stations to gas stations, which continued under Major.

Not much happened after Tories left office in 1997 as Labour was allergic to doing anything about coal. They did give out solar panel grants from about 2002 onwards though, so lots of homes took that up.

It wasn't till the coalition came to power and insisted on offshore wind farms that a real difference started to be felt, because you can build huge farms offshore. They also passed the Energy Bill 2012/13, which basically forced the grid to use renewable energy first if it was available (before that the grid used whatever was cheapest at the time). So if there is a choice of wind, gas and coal, they have to use the wind first, followed by gas and then coal. That is what made the difference, and made it viable for developers to build wind farms - before that they were building farms but their wind energy wasn't being purchased by the grid if they could get cheap Polish coal instead.",2019-05-27T18:06:29+00:00,t1_ep0slu1,,,,,,,,,,,,

europe,comment,climate,l69sdzv,nvkylebrown,,"From Wikipedia:

>The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, a tax passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act believing it violated their rights as Englishmen to ""no taxation without representation"", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a parliament in which they were not represented. The well-connected East India Company also had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business.

The Boston Tea Party related very directly to what was being protested, a tax on tea, and advantage given to a particular corporation.  The tea thrown into the harbor was East India Company tea, sooo, you can't get too much more direct than that.

1. Open up ministerial positions to all MPs, regardless of party. A big problem in the UK is that these positions are given out to reward supporters rather than who would be best for the role. Just having ministers be somewhat knowledgeable in their area of governance would be a huge improvement imo.

2. Seek closer ties to the EU. Look into forming some sort of European-wide commission that looks at the applications of any asylum seekers that arrives in Europe, processes their application and then decides which country they will be placed in based on available space, languages spoken, preference of the asylum seeker etc. Countries could also receive a small budget for language teaching/job training, hopefully turning the asylum crisis into a controlled and regulated influx of low-skilled workers.

3. Nationalise rail and public transport. Maybe water too. Start building nuclear reactors as future investment into nationalised energy.

4. Build loads of infrastructure. Build HS2, renew plans for a high speed rail between England and France, Build new homes, develop the North, develop the Oxford-Milton Keynes-Cambridge area further, etc. Aim is to create lots of jobs to stimulate the economy.",2024-05-06T07:26:16+00:00,t3_1cksb3t,,,,,,,,,,,,

>Do you know if there is a critical mass of contaminated substances that can be in the ground before it’s too dangerous? Would the entire world being powered by nuclear supersede this critical mass? Do you actually know any of this for a certain fact or are you knee-jerkingly calling anyone with doubts “anti science”

Oh lol.... what anti science nonsense you spreading... you clearly don't know anything about this. Stop listening to morons like Caroline Lucas and her gang of anti science and nuclear loons. You clearly are just another anti nuclear loon, and your lies and dishonesty is clear. 



>Can’t believe the tories say nuclear is environmentally okay and you’re just like, “yep just as sustainable as windmills” haha… Jesus

again with the lies... never said it was ""as sustainable"" as windmills... It's not a binary thing.",2023-03-16T16:17:21+00:00,t1_jcg3a73,,,,,,,,,,,,

ukpolitics,comment,carbon,kxlgya2,-fireeye-,,"Absolutely great article. 

We often get doom and gloom - from both extremes - but we have done quite well in cutting our emissions. Before anyone says this is just because we've outsourced it to China, from the article:

> The UK’s consumption-based CO2 emissions increased between 1990 and 2007. Since then, however, they have fallen by a similar number of tonnes as emissions within the UK.

Next steps are definitely harder because it requires buy in from general population as we move to EVs and heat pumps. This is harder than switching powerplants from coal to gas however 1. we've done something at this scale during 70s moving from coal gas to natural gas, and 2. required buy in is not helped by climate doomerism. 

Only way to get that buy in is to demonstrate - with reports like this - that we have made substantial progress, without tanking our economy and we just need to do little more to get over the hump.",2024-04-01T20:22:44+00:00,t3_1btc1gk,,,,,,,,,,,,

unitedkingdom,post,warming,ch2u4e,bluewolfhudson,There were riots on 2010 for snaller issues than we have now.,"There are so many problems at the moment and the only protests we seem to be able to fast out are when trump cones to visit. Why are we not just doing a full on citizen shut down. Everyone is pissed about brexit leave or remain, the government isn't doing anything about the global warming  emergency they declared, there are thousands of people who relay  on food banks to live, are new PM was decided by a tiny percentage of our country, our local councils are ignored by London, our NHS is in crisis and nothing is happening or what's happening isn't happening fast enough.  The government and parliament have been so caught up in brexit they have ignored all the other problems that have been building and building  to busy with party politics to make a real change. We need to do somthing to say that we are fed up with it but there is nothing officially we can do. There won't be a general election, we can't change the government for years. Nothing will change unless pur voice is heard. 

I know nothing like this would actually happen but it's a nice thought as I see it we have never had a better reason to protest/ cause problems for the government.
