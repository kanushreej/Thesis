Scotland,comment,VAT,ckg4ump,JohnnyButtocks,,"It is not all about money, perhaps that is all that has reached Germany, if the recent Die Zeit article is anything to go by, your coverage is not to be taken seriously and is essentially a mouth piece for the British press, which has proven itself, with the exception of a small number of commentators, incapable of fairly representing this referendum. There has in fact been a very positive campaign focussed on the political and social intentions of a new Scottish state.

But of course part of the debate has centred around money, as it rightly should, because it would be preposterous to secede from a union, without knowing whether you can stand on your own feet. However much damage the political union is doing to Scotland's poor and working classes, it would be dwarfed by a complete failure of the new state to meet its demands. Add to this the fact that the No campaign has focussed almost exclusively around propaganda that Scotland would be a bankrupt, ruined state without the rest of Britain, and perhaps you can understand why the Yes campaign has been keen to make as good an economic case as a possible.

Also the analogy with the reunification of Germany is not exactly a good parallel. The reunification of Germany was a major geopolitical event. It precipitate the end of soviet control in Europe, and ultimately the breakdown of the USSR, we are trying to simply have a peaceful discussion about the political institutions on this island and who they represent. I don't know anyone on the yes side who actively wants to severe from England culturally or socially, though that is a likely repercussion of independence. We simply want to handle our own fiscal affairs, so that we can shape the country into one which better represents the views of its people. It's not a major geopolitical event, no matter how important the English elite believe themselves to be, that ship sailed a long time ago.

Hopefully that answers your question.

We are not obsessed with the money question, we are just attempting to be as diligent as possible, while countering what amounts to propaganda from Westminster. At any rate we are fighting over the undecideds at this stage.

However, the Government does not support provisions that would confer greater legal rights on foreign businesses than those available to domestic businesses. Nor will the Government support provisions that would constrain the ability of Australian governments to make laws on social, environmental and economic matters in circumstances where those laws do not discriminate between domestic and foreign businesses. The Government has not and will not accept provisions that limit its capacity to put health warnings or plain packaging requirements on tobacco products or its ability to continue the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme... In the past, Australian Governments have sought the inclusion of investor-state dispute resolution procedures in trade agreements with developing countries at the behest of Australian businesses. The Gillard Government will discontinue this practice. If Australian businesses are concerned about sovereign risk in Australian trading partner countries, they will need to make their own assessments about whether they want to commit to investing in those countries...

That's the basic problem with inheritance, it propagates wealth inequality down the generations.

Labour,post,income tax,ca8rdn,kespembroke,The unmentionable way to win UK elections,"There was a paper by one of the conservative think thanks published in the late 70s that showed that even *given the same level of income and education and class* voters were far more likely to vote to the right if:

&#x200B;

* They owned and used a car rather than using public transport.
* They owned shares rather than having a pension.
* They owned a house instead of renting.

That is even middle-upper class voters were more likely to vote left  instead of right if they used public transport, had a pension, and  rented, and most importantly even working class voters would vote for  the right if they owned a car, some shares, and a house, no matter how  thin such ownership was.

Just fancying themselves landlords with a sliver of equity in a  modest 2-up-2-down made working class voters think that their interests  were aligned with those of bosses and peers of the realm rather than the  interests of other workers.

I think that the original push to therefore undermine public  transport, pensions, rented housing came from Keith Joseph, but it could  have been Nigel Lawson who clinched the deal, or Norman Tebbit, or  Malcolm Rifkind.

Whoever was, that voting attitude study has become the right-wing  bible in many countries, and in the UK Thatcher determinedly targeted  enormous subsidies at car, share, and house ownership, while sabotaging  public transport, the pensions system and the rented sector.

The stroke of genius was of course Right-to-Buy and the legal  prohibition to use for house building the meager proceeds from selling  rented council housing at well below market prices to future gratefully  Tory voters.

Because of course pushing up house prices and pushing down wages may  be break even for a voter - but what it does is mean they have a far  greater % of income coming from property. People notice when being  landlords nearly doubles their income.

This was the goal of the social engineering policy, because it was a *social* engineering policy, not a *political* engineering one.

The goal was not to make working class people change their *vote* to that for the party of another class, it was to make them change their *class identification* to that of the other class.

This arguably has succeeded *materially*. A pithy summary by the BBC on one important detail:

[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19288208](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19288208)

""In 2001, the average price of a house was £121,769 and the average  salary was £16,557, according to the National Housing Federation. A  decade on, the typical price of a property is 94% higher at £236,518,  while average wages are up 29% to £21,330""

Now, currently in the South-East a 230K house is a working class  two-up/two-down terraces house, and 20K is a working class income, let's  say in marketing categories C1-C2.

The figures above basically say that the average ""working class""  person in the South East got tax-free capital gains for £12,000 per year  for 10 years, that is an extra 70% on top of their after-tax job  income.

That’s an average between the North and the South, and it does not really apply to the North.

But even it taking it as it is, that means £12,000 a year for a  decade of tax-free effort-free income for a working class family in the  South earning around £16,000 after tax.

And £12,000 (likely more) a year of tax-free effort-free windfall is  GIGANTIC, especially if it recurs every year for 10 years as per the  above numbers; and actually it has been going on for 20-30 years. And  for the millions of people with a house in London it has been even  bigger than in the rest of the South. Do people here really realize what  an extra £12,000 a year of (purely redistributive rentier) windfall  going on for decades can mean on top of an earned after tax income of  £16,000? For millions if not a dozen million families? Do readers here  realize what that means to “aspirational” Southern voters and what they  are prepared to vote for to keep it coming? Also that these people are  “right-wing” is not quite right, those voters are rather socialist and  left-wing when it comes to their own civil rights and their own incomes,  just like the traders and executives in the City and in business. They  want a big-state for me, but a small-state for thee. These assholes are  ferociously right-wing when it comes to the civil rights and incomes of  “scroungers” and “nasties”, Northerners and men. Also because a large  chunk of South East property owning middle aged and older landladies are  baby boomers who grew very ""liberated"" during the 60-70s and a lot of  them got rid of their husbands one or more times. They are both  Thatcherite and “socially/sexually liberal”, so not a mixed situation.  Relevantly Cameron owes a large part of his being leader of the  Conservatives to his targeting that constituency. 

So if they look at their income, they are getting nearly 40% of their  income from their property, for no effort whatsoever other than voting  for politicians who use the word ""aspiration"" and dog-whistle that they  will push for higher house prices and lower employment and wages.

The conclusion is that the prized swing voters in marginal seats in  the South East tend to be middle aged and retired women with property  and remortgages (“old aunts”) and what they want is: \* 

\*higher property prices,

\*lower taxes on property,

\*lower remortgage interest rates,

\*lower wages for workers, especially young men,

\*lower benefits for men, especially from the North.

\*higher benefits and protections for women, especially older ones, especially in the South East.",2019-07-07T16:35:39+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Labour,comment,taxpayer,fqh24v2,kavabean2,,"> but unless it’s accompanied by legislation making it unlawful to rent out a property then what is to stop the money being reinvested in rental property? 

If the government uses it's borrowing power to provide efficient rents no private entity could compete because of their far higher borrowing costs.  It's really not complicated. 

If 1br in Manchester drops from 800 in current market to 400 because of state management of rental stock no private investor can provide a 1BR flat for 400 without having a very low return on capital, e.g. 1%.  Very few private investors would do so since just to make that 1% they would have to incur the significant risk of loss if there was a housing downturn. 

Capital is all that is required to be a landlord.  It's not magic.

> And if it is made unlawful for private indivudals to rent out property that starts to sound very authoritarian - particularly to the person who wants to rent out their own house whilst they work abroad or in another part of the country (and probably rent wherever they're working). Besides, a law like that would be pretty difficult to write - no private individual landlords?

None of us have absolute freedom.  I don't have the freedom to find a 1BR flat that doesn't take 50% of my salary. I'm not interested in the unlimited freedom of rich people.

It would not be difficult to provide caveats to people temporarily away from their properties.  Acting like this is complicated in the era of modern technology is either silly or disingenuous IMO. 

> I also can't see any Council or Housing Association or similar 'social' landlord wanting to get involved with lots of geographically dispersed properties with varying maintenance requirements. That makes for high management costs and complexity. Social landlords prefer new build estates with limited geographic dispersion. Similarly, most social landlords are in the business or providing long term homes not short term lets for a mobile workforce.

This is a vacuous statement. You have no data.  Right now my neighbour's flat is let by an agency that I know because of an acquaintance has 8 employees and manages over 1000 flats.  There is no evidence that public firms are any less efficient than private firms.  Let's say worst case overhead for 8 employees is 400k.  Rent for 1000 flats in Manchester is 1200*12 = 14400/yr * 1000 = 14.4M/yr, social rent based on state access to capital is generally half so the social rent would be 7.2M.  400k/7.2M = 5% management overhead.  This makes sense since most management firms charge around 10% and that has to include profit, i.e. it's in the right ballpark. 

Management has already been taken care of as part of the study showing rent would be less than half.  Even if you add it as a separate component rent for 1BR in Manchester would go from 800/pcm to 400+5%=420pcm. 

Your point has no merit. 

> On the numbers side, most private landlords make a return on capital of 3% - 5% which is not a fortune but good enough in today’s market. They will pay tax on their rental income which goes to the Government. So ... the government loses that money and effectively it goes to the tenant instead?

The bad logic continues.  Renters are generally lower-income working class. If rents drop by half because of government intervention then they have extra money.  These workers spend every pound they earn so that money would immediately flow into the economy and generate either profits or wages (costs). It only takes a basic spreadsheet that the tax windfall from that activity would overwhelmingly dwarf any income from landlords it displaces.

Everytime I've heard working to rule in regards to the police it's about being painful to the general community so they get painful to the politicians. You enforce the law by the book. I know a lot of folk on this site think the police don't let folk away with much but they ignore shit all the time and let folks off with warnings for arrestable offences all the time (can't be bothered doing the paperwork for a minor offence).

ukpolitics,comment,pension,k13ij42,BritRedditor1,,"Voters do not want Jeremy Hunt to cut taxes in his autumn statement but most believe that pensions should rise by 8.5 per cent, a poll suggests.

To the dismay of some Tory MPs, the chancellor said last week that tax cuts were “unlikely” because of persistent inflation. He said taxes were more likely to rise than fall until better growth could be delivered in the economy.

A YouGov poll for The Times suggests that his unwillingness to cut taxes is supported by the public and even more so among Tory voters.

The poll found that 41 per cent of voters believed cutting taxes would be the wrong thing to do and 32 per cent thought it would be right. The rest were uncertain.

Among Conservative voters 48 per cent thought it would be wrong to cut taxes, and 32 per cent that it would be right. However, the poll also suggested that most voters want pensions to increase by at least 8.5 per cent and benefits to rise in line with inflation.

Hunt is reportedly considering a temporary suspension of the triple lock, which ensures pensions rise by the highest of inflation, wage growth or 2.5 per cent.

Pensioners would receive an 8.5 per cent increase next year under the triple lock after this year’s 10.1 per cent rise.

The poll found that 46 per cent of people believed Hunt should keep the triple lock this year and give pensioners an increase that matches inflation. Another 21 per cent thought pensions should rise by more than 8.5 per cent.


As the population ages, the annual cost of pensions will be £135 billion by 2025, more than is spent on education, police and defence combined.

William Hague, the former Tory leader who is now a Times columnist, is among those who have called for the triple lock to be scrapped, and Labour has refused to give an undertaking to keep it if it wins the next election.

Hunt has little room to make spending commitments after the Office for Budget Responsibility found his plans met his fiscal rules by just £6.5 billion earlier this year, a record low margin. He is considering whether to keep benefit increases below the rate of inflation, a decision that would be controversial among Tory MPs. Liz Truss tried to do the same last year but abandoned her plans because of resistance from within the party.

In total 48 per cent of people thought benefits should rise at the same rate as inflation and 13 per cent thought the increases should exceed it, the YouGov poll found.

No 10 has been holding talks about scrapping inheritance tax as part of an offer to voters before the election next year, The Times reported this summer. Abolishing the tax would cost about £7 billion, much cheaper than cutting income tax, and would form part of an offer to voters in blue wall seats.

But Hunt has played down the likelihood of any imminent tax cuts in the autumn statement on November 22.

Asked whether he had more headroom for tax cuts than earlier this year by Bloomberg TV last week, Hunt said: “I think it’s unlikely because since the spring budget, when the last numbers were published, we’ve seen inflation stickier than was forecast at the time and that means that interest payments are higher.”",2023-09-18T07:29:56+00:00,t3_16loudh,,,,,,,,,,,,

ukpolitics,comment,PAYE,l13ad3w,Daxidol,,"> Can you redo the calculations based on actual NI contributions (8% then 2% over the higher wage).

My calculation was based on significantly less monthly than his actual contribution since the 70's, since I have no data from before then (but the average would of course be less) and like I said it was a rough estimation. Even if you half the monthly contribution the compounding interest would still give him a salary of £127k/year today, an amount that eclipses what he currently receives.

Play with the numbers however you want, but a 52 year compounding investment, using the average return, is going to be a lot more than '5-10 years' of the current payout for basically everyone.

> Why would £2.7m be generating interest? Pensions aren't a pot you pay into - they're paid for by current workers.

I understand that, but you suggested he would get out what he paid in, adjusted to include the average stock market return. I took that to mean they would receive a payment monthly instead of the full 2.7m once they retired. If you meant for it to be a bulk payment, my apologies.

> And where did you get 90 years from? Your grandad would get his NIC contributions but if your grandma didn't work she'd get nothing.

Because what he paid in would continue to receive compounding interest until he died. He's getting on and I'd be surprised if it makes it to an 80 year compounding return on that original investment payment. To be clear, I based the calculation on a 52 year return, which is how many years he personally worked and the 200k+/year would be taking the interest from that point on (so no longer compounding). The 90 was a range, not what was used in this instance.

But their income was joined, as they were a married household. I was more asking what would happen in the event that the husband dies before the wife, should what they paid in as a household not continue until they both die? Of course, if you did indeed mean for the bulk payout at retirement age, I agree with your position.

---

Perhaps a simpler way for me to put it, you're saying that someone investing 8% of a 25k/year salary (£166/month), getting the 10 year average for the next 52 years would get a payout of £17.6m when they retire. Even if we assume an average inflation rate of 5% for the next 52 years, it's the equivalent of £1.4m today. Just the interest on that payout is far more than what pensioners receive and even if we just used that 1.4m payout to give the average weekly pension, even though the 1.4m was based on the below average salary, it's enough for the next 52 years of pension. 52 years is far longer than the average that pensions today are claimed for.",2024-04-24T19:30:12+00:00,t1_l135p4f,,,,,,,,,,,,

You're a fucking moron. This has already been addressed in the first post. In the event of EEA/EFTA Brexit, the UK could re-enact the Union Customs Code (https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/union-customs-code/ucc-introduction_en) and any other flanking legislation to TIR system (see: TIR Convention in force in the EU today) recognition and enjoy relatively free movement of goods across borders. Tariffs and taxes would be collect electronically and conformity inspections carried out after the vehicle has crossed the border (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:31992R2913&from=EN). Unloadings which must be inspected will be carried out at inland ports or inland clearance depots before delivery (https://www.bifa.org/library/freight-business/services/customs/customs-at-import).

Under a EEA/EFTA Brexit, the UK could use the Convention on a Common Transit Procedure to allow for goods to cross borders without border checks (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM%3Al11025) if the UK opts to maintain the current harmonised system (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-community-and-common-transit-outwards/uk-trade-tariff-community-and-common-transit-outwards) and (https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/legislation_en). However, this is up to the Government. It will be the Government's fault that border checks would be reinstated post-Brexit.

Scotland,comment,pension,jeeon37,Urushnor,,"I've got a really good idea to see if the people of Scotland want it.  What we should do, right, is have an election, in Holyrood (as it's a fairer system operating on a form of PR, rather than the rather broken, unrepresentative FPTP system of Westminster) where parties stand on the platform of having a referendum.  The resulting Parliament are the elected representatives of the people of Scotland, so what they want should therefore be taken as an indication of what the people of Scotland want.

Oh, wait, we've already done that - and the result is a Parliament that is majority pro-referendum.

Maybe that's the incorrect way to do it, so should we have a national vote about what the correct way to have an indication about the people of Scotland indicating they want a referendum on independence?  Or should we have a referendum about whether having such a vote is the correct thing to do?

The simple fact of the matter is that, unless you simply want to throw democracy out of the window, as far as this issue is concerned, the results of the last Holyrood election should be seen as a clear indication that a referendum should be held.  Instead, what seems to be happening is various people trying to justify an ever increasing number of hurdles and barriers to overcome before a referendum can even be considered, like how this was the SNP 'tricking the people of Scotland', somehow.  And, remember, a referendum, in and of itself, is not declaring independence - it's simply giving the people of Scotland the democratic opportunity to answer the question of whether we should, and it's undeniable that this is being totally opposed by Westminster.

Whereas porters and cleaners are important parts of the NHS, but ultimately it's largely unskilled work.

In a capitalist system such as the one we live in, people's pay is largely based on both the value they bring to the organisation and how readily they can be replaced.

I'm not sure what could be done for farmers. Though agricultural land with no possibility of planning permission isn't that expensive. 

Assuming it's done right it would be hard for rich people to evade a land tax no matter how good their accountant was. Some of them would be able to pass the cost on to their tenants though. And it wouldn't be done right because the very rich would make sure that their tame politicians would leave a loophole or two. 

Initially I'd like to go for something a bit less ambitious. When land increases in value due to planning permission being awarded, I'd like to see the increase in value revert to the local authority. In these cases the landowner has done nothing, but the value of their land has increased tenfold. This keeps the property bubble artificially inflated.

First of all, it's not. The poorer EU countries are fucked over by the richer ones, both governments and large corporations. And they suffer low wages. If the EU was a progressive organisation, it would force a high minimum wage on the poorer member (paid for willingly by Western EU taxpayers, who would support it in the name of progress). After all, we are told that the EU is a single economy. so why isn't there a single minimum wage. Why should a bulgarian be content with earning £300 a month?

anyway, my issues with this is Britain is one of the most class divided countries in the developed world.

the way I've seen it, cheap foreign labour is basically used to prop up the class system and destroy the native working class. The fact that left wingers, who used to care about the native working class, sold themselves out to globalisation, because heyho 'diversity' is used as a way to embellish their 'progressive' credentials, really angers me. The British left are essentially 'xenophillic', they love the foreign and exotic, and dismiss their own people as evil, backwards, racists etc etc.. Even tho the ordinary working class man just wants to be able to earn enough to get a mortgage and raise a family, the left only see it in terms of diversity is good because it brings ethnic food and music.

Labour would have the cover of it being forced onto them, while equalisation would be additionally attractive if they were also in power in London.",2023-12-20T14:46:18+00:00,t1_ke6mi62,,,,,,,,,,,,
unitedkingdom,comment,taxpayer,hop06jh,Redditerers,,Lifetime bans exist ya just gotta know some fucked up people for example I know a guy whos on a lifetime ban (also doing time in prison) and he's never even held a license. I know people who have held licenses but are also on lifetime bans because they either killed people or nearly killed people. Obviously not their first time getting a ban as it takes quite a lot of fuck ups to get lifetime bans. I also know another guy on a 10 year ban.

europe,comment,income tax,fr2maev,JN324,,"America is a bad example as they are just really bad with tax revenue, but I can completely understand why someone would watch them and be hesitant. CANZUK, Switzerland and so on have very similar rates and are good places to live (in my opinion of course). I think a variety of tax regimes can work, a lot of it is just reliant on political culture, the top 15 or so in the HDI rankings is half low/moderate tax countries like Ireland, Switzerland, Hong Kong (SAR), Australia, Singapore, Canada, NZ, UK, and half moderate to high tax Soc Dem’s like Norway, Germany, Iceland, Sweden, Netherlands, Denmark and Finland.

Beyond a certain age it's probably far too much to expect the elderly to be the first up to speed with the latest technologies and so forth, but leaving them socially isolated and vegetating is pretty rubbish for their mental health, and leaves them vulnerable to all sorts of QAnon-style brainwashing and radicalisation.",2023-08-10T20:09:25+00:00,t1_jvlv36w,,,,,,,,,,,,
