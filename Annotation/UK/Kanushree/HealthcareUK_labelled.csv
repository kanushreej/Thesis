I think in part one of the problem is the USA does not have much of a safety net. When trump said ""The USA was not made for shutting down"" I thought well that is stupid because what country is ? However the USA has very little support if you are out of work. their is not country wide system. For example unemployment payments are state based they work like insurance you pay into the state and they pay out if your out of work. However those payments only last 6 months. 

Health care is another issue because again that is linked into having a job and playing into a plan to pay for it. If you are not working you have no health care in effect.

I know it is more ""complex"" and to say their is no support is not true but you have this complex system between government and state which leaves a lot of gaps. If american is not working the system falls apart.

The other issue is Americans dont trust government / or state control. They have this idea drilled into them everything is about freedom and anything which impacts self determination is seen as a communist plot. I have seen it in some pictures that the lock down is being seens as a communist control. The shadow of the cold war is cast across the country in ways which in europe never was. It leaves they with this distrust of the government even if they are working in the best interest of the people to save their lives.

europe,comment,Healthcare,cssd7em,Jacks_lack_of_trying,,">It's not their debt, it's private debt that was socialised to protect a structurally unsound monetary union.

It's still their debt. Buy-out of creditors does not annul the commitment of the debtor. 

>Why should they?

Because you should do the things you promised to do, such as paying back the money you owe? 

>received loans from the central European nations to prop up their banking systems - not because it was a generous/right thing to do - but because German (mostly) banks held huge amounts of periphery debt on their balance sheets

Let's assume this is true. Doesn't change anything. On one side you have self-interested people who want to get the money they're owed, on the other you have self interested people who don't want to pay it back. So I go back to my question: ""Are we supposed to forget about that money and the good it will do because we are not yet as broke as you are? ""

>Had the Germans not propped up the banking systems in the periphery, they would have faced their own catastrophic banking crisis which would have led to a need to recapitalise their own banks.

They have every right to buy out the debt of their banks. Moreover, if, as you claim, a major crisis was looming if they didn't, they had a moral obligation to. They had the money, they did it. Where, in this, was greece in any way spoiled? 

>As appealing as your 'household budget' view of economics might be, austerity doesn't mean that.Austerity is an ideology to dismantle worker's rights, state institutions and political and economic sovereignty.


Is this supposed to be an objective definition? 

The reason the ""household budget"" view is appealing is because it's common sense. Giving it a name does nothing to explain why it is wrong. 





> Shitting all over the Greeks is not just missing the point, it's akin to turning around and shooting an orphaned child in the head. 

Oh nooo, not the metaphor of the orphan who gets shot in the head! Does he have big, tear-filled eyes? Is his disabled  homeless surrogate mother pleading with god as she holds him in her dirty arms? Because I'm almost convinced. I must be a monster for giving my opinion on greek debt.

Lets look at the NHS now. A Physician Associate made a 'mistake' leading to the death of Emily Chesterton. Has this role been 'grounded'? No, infact the very same Physician Associate is still working without consequence. Again, you may be thinking that GPs make mistakes too but believe me when I say absolutely no fully trained GP would have missed the DVT/PE in this case. It really was barndoor.

Also, modern planes do half the flying for you, hence there is no longer a need for the additional roles you mentioned.

But having someone with *some* experience is actually worse, because since it takes time to go from career to MP to Minister to Secretary, the chances of your experience still being relevant are greatly reduced, plus you experience is likely to be limited compared to the big picture you’ll be expected to deal with, and so when problems inevitably crop up you see the solutions through your own personal experience, which limits you.

The issue of their pay came up, the sentiment of they get paid 2/3 the national average so they should see more people was raised..

Only one person brought up the subject that even Pre-Pandemic there were major issues with being able to see GP's because of there is simply not enough.

nhs,comment,Healthcare,g4kk13s,Scuzzlebuttzz,,"TL:DR
In my experience, take the bullet points from the Key Responsibilities section and paste them into Microsoft word, or some other word processor. Insert some spaces between each, and use those as headings, then produce short paragraphs demonstrating how you can deliver against these responsibilities, using the Person Specification as a guide. That’s how I do my applications for NHS posts. I’ve applied for 9 posts over the past 6 years, and was interviewed for each of them (only appointee to 8 though, darn it!)

-

Understanding it from a Recruiting Managers perspective can be very helpful, but isn’t something that’s exactly available to simply ‘Google’. Luckily though, I’ve done my share of recruitment over the years.

Shortlisting is measured and scored based on four headings: how the candidate scores against - Education/Qualification, Experience, Skills/Knowledge, and Desirables. (this was the case last time I recruited somebody, around 2/3 years back, but please anybody, correct me if I’m wrong) You will recognise these headings when you look at a Person Specification.

Now, because the NHS is a publicly funded body, they are required to undertake a consistent, fair and transparent interview and scoring process. Going back to the headings I’ve mentioned above; at the point of shortlisting, the recruiting manager would score candidates against these headings out of 4 or 5 stars (I forget which, but you get the point). 
This is where using Key Responsibilities as temporary headings, and inserting your response below each in line with the Person Specification, helps create a well structured application.

To put it another way, imagine you are the recruiting manager, reviewing and shortlisting this very application. If the candidate’s application is is structured in the same order which I am marking it against (which is more than likely the order in which the Key Responsibilities are laid out) then I am going to have a very easy time pulling out the information that I am looking for, and won’t miss anything that would otherwise be buried in a sea of waffle. Assuming that you are applying for roles within your skill set, this approach should almost certainly get you to the interview stage.

Furthermore, It’s very common that vacant NHS posts get a lot of applicants. With that in mind, again assume the role of the Recruiting Manager for a moment, shortlisting is a very lengthy, tedious and repetitive process, and it is human nature to become fatigued after the first few. If you can make their life as easy as possible, in terms of structuring, then you will certainly increase your chances of securing an interview.",2020-09-09T18:25:26+00:00,t3_ipjkaj,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please forgive me for my lack of understanding on this subject but I need some knowledge on the subject of emigration. 

So I am within a large international company based of the the US, but where I work is in the U.K.  There are international openings within the company fairly often. I am trained to maintain specific pieces of machinery that this company uses. I can speak French and want to move abroad, preferably to a french speaking country such as France or Belgium, one day to hopefully live out the rest of my days but my sister says this will not be possible as we’re no longer part of the EU. She says that they will always be biased to people from that country even if I could manage to get a visa. Is it that it is illegal for the company to sponsor a visa for me if I am moving within the company also? The way she’s describing it, is that I won’t at all be able to move abroad at all. 

Again, sorry for the lack of understanding on my part and I thank you all in advanced for any information

unitedkingdom,comment,Healthcare,duoav9n,ilovemesomebananas,,"*The National Health Service — states Nicholas Macpherson, a former permanent secretary to the Treasury — is a “bottomless pit”. The implication is that the spending is limitless and valueless. That is false. The spending is valued, but needs to be greater than politicians admit. They underfund it, only to plead innocence when “crises” duly emerge. An honest political assessment of the pressures and how they are to be met is essential.

Nothing is unusual or excessive about UK spending on health. According to the OECD, UK overall spending was 9.7 per cent of gross domestic product in 2016. Of members of the group of seven large high-income countries, Italy alone spent a lower share of GDP on health than Britain. In the UK, the bulk of health spending comes from the government: this was 7.7 per cent of GDP in 2016. That, too, was below all other members of the G7, bar Italy.

Spending on health has risen over time, across the OECD. Increases in spending have been relatively large in the UK since 2000. But its spending had been exceptionally low back then. This universal tendency reflects medical advances and an ageing and demanding population. It is inescapable.

British government spending on health also tends to be feast followed by famine. According to Siva Anandaciva of the King’s Fund, the budget of the NHS increased at 8.6 per cent a year in real terms, between 2001-02 and 2004-05. But the increases will average just 1.1 per cent a year between 2009-10 and 2020-21. Sooner or later this squeeze was bound to show up in performance.

The starting point for any sane discussion of health spending is that it will tend to rise relative to GDP. But by how much? According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, government spending on health will increase, other things being equal, from “6.9 per cent of GDP in 2021-22 to 12.6 per cent of GDP in 2066-67”. Thus, if the economy were to grow at 1.5 per cent a year, the incremental share in GDP of spending on health would be about 18 per cent.

One response might be that the system could be made far more efficient. But, in terms of performance, particularly relative to sums spent, the UK system is rather good. Efficiency could no doubt be improved: it always can be. But there is no reason to suppose far better healthcare could be provided to all without also spending more.
Another response might be that the government should refuse to meet the pressure for additional spending. Admitting that honestly would take suicidal political courage. Private insurers would need to fill the growing gaps. But they would fail to cover many people, either because of poverty or prior medical conditions. This would move Britain into the US system — a regressive, immoral and grossly expensive option.

An alternative might be a shift into compulsory social insurance, as in Germany. But this is a tax by another name. Generally, such contributions come from earned incomes. This is particularly unreasonable in an ageing society, where much spending is on the elderly. The well-off old should contribute. So the funds should be supported by levies on everyone. Going through the complexities of re-badging a tax-funded system into one that is also in effect a tax-funded system is altogether senseless.

The conclusion is quite simple: the best way for the UK to meet the pressure is to raise taxes in the most efficient possible manner. Some fees might be considered, to reduce irresponsible use of the NHS, but these must not be set at a penal level. It is also necessary to re-organise the system, to cover health and social care in an integrated manner, instead of the current mess, as argued in the King’s Fund’s Barker review.

Most serious analysts come to this obvious conclusion. But some believe it can only be sold to the public via some form of jiggery pokery. Thus, a special tax could be created to fund the NHS, at least at the margin. As Lord Macpherson, a reluctant convert to this idea, recognises, critics would view this as “a presentational wheeze and at worst a fiddle”. The critics would be right. Spending on health neither would, could nor should be tied to the proceeds of such a tax. Politicians should tell the people openly and honestly that the system they treasure will get more expensive over time and so taxes will also have to rise.

Pretending commitment to a first-rate service, while refusing to pay for it, has inevitable results, not just for the NHS, but also for the esteem in which politicians are (or rather are not) held. Sooner or later, the public notices that it is being had. So why not try a bit of honesty? It would be a revolutionary idea. It could prove a good one.*",2018-02-22T22:04:19+00:00,t3_7zisuv,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just eat is the go to for brands like Starbucks, macdonalds etc.

Deliveroo has the best range of restaurants and usually decent drivers, there is a problem with a Brazilian gang here that basically all conglomerate in the city center so I would, if possible try not order from anything in the city unless it's not available elsewhere as they will be on a bike with a car account meaning very slow delivery.

My personal recommendations, all from deliveroo.

Bunsen for a burger.

Turkey street Kebabs for a kebab.

India gate for an Indian curry.

Kamakura for Japanese (by far the best food in all Belfast imo)

People swear by Boojum, I'm not a fan since the massive dip in quality in 2018/2019 but it's one of the only Burrito places going.
