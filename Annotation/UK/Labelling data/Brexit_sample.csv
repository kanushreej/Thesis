AskUK,post,immigration,x3kkz8,lincolnjkc,American visiting Scotland: Practically how prevalent are cash-only (or cash-encouraged) places these days? [IOW: How many physical pound notes do I really need],"Greetings!

My wife and I are returning to Scotland for our 5th anniversary this weekend (we were married in the Highlands -- plan is a day in Edinburgh, then up to Dornie/Skye for the week, then back to Edinburgh for the balance) it occurred to me while packing that I hadn't thought to order any GBP notes. Planning on hitting a cash machine as soon as I clear immigration to get *some* quantity of local currency for my own comfort if nothing else. 

On this side of the pond, save for tipping I can't think of the last time I used cash -- with a significant number of establishments being card only ""due to Covid"". Is it generally the same feeling in Scotland now or is cash more prevalent/expected/critical ? Trying to figure out how much is the right amount without having to visit a cash machine every 15 minutes or coming back with a lot of unused money and definitely trying not to irk/annoy the shopkeepers, cabbies, etc. we'll be purchasing from . 

E.g. for the week, assuming plastic is our default payment ... £50? £100? £500? 

Either my Googling is defective or I'm not using the right terms -- a lot of what I've found is either pre-pandemic or more ""proving to customs that you have enough to support yourself""-type info.

LabourUK,post,single market,vhd53t,MMSTINGRAY,Keir Hardie on what the Labour Party is for,"There seems to be a lot of confusion about what Labour was founded to do, I hope this might help make things more clear for some people.

>The CHAIRMAN, who had reserved his introductory remarks, after dinner addressed the conference. He said a question often asked in relation to public affairs was, “Where is the Labour party?” He trusted that after the proceedings of that conference had been concluded they would have a good and sufficient answer to give to that question. The Labour party, however, was not an organisation; it had neither programme nor constitution, but was the expression of a great principle, the determination of the workers to be the arbiters of their own destiny. There were not in that meeting any of the great or learned ones of the sons of men, and therein lay the hope of the movement. They were there such as they wore, such as circumstances had created them, as the expression of an inborn and undying determination on the part of the democracy of this land to assert itself in its own spirit and through its own methods They would have plenty of advice and sympathy showered upon them in the future,as they had had in the past. He trusted that no man would ever be above giving serious consideration to all the advice so freely bestowed upon them. But after all, the Labour movement could not afford to swerve in the slightest degree from its own path in deference to the desire or the wishes of any person or organisation outside the Labour movement itself. (Hear, hear.) The demand of the Labour party was for economic freedom, which was the natural outcome of political enfranchisement. It was possible to have a mockery of freedom in the form of a people exercising a State franchise, and yet bound by economic conditions more harsh and cruel in their operation than any want of a vote could possibly impose. The aim of the Labour movement was to direct the attention of the workers away from questions of reform of the political machinery, no matter how important these may be, and to concentrate their whole energies on this one problem of how to restore to the working classes of the community the capital, the land, without which they could not live or carry on their industrial operations; and anything, no matter what it might be, which came between the workers and this object was an enemy to the movement, and as such should be removed. (Hear, hear.) He asked, then, that the delegates should realise the responsibility resting upon them, and he trusted that the form which the organisation would ultimately assume would be one which would leave to every locality the fullest and most ample freedom to develop along its own lines. If they desired to play havoc with the movement they could not do better than begin by making a strait-waistcoat in the form of a constitution. The movement was outside the scope of any constitution. He pleaded for a wise confidence in those who they might select as their executive. Confidence was of slow growth, but unless they were to have ample and complete confidence in the men who were to be at the head and to be their representatives in the intervals between the conferences, much better have no committee at all. 

\- Hardie speech at the first conference of the ILP reported in the Glasgow Herald in 1893

>What was good fifty years ago is to-day the stumbling-block in the cause of progress. For Liberalism remains what it was, whilst the issues have changed. There is no need now to fight the battle of the franchise. Our fathers did that, and to-day only the details remain to be adjusted. Religious liberty is not in question, and Lord Rosebery’s idea of religious equality is an equal division of the State loaves and fishes among the different claimants. The Radical merchant and manufacturer, who belonged to the common people, and who, despite his success, still carried with him his hatred of and contempt for the aristocracy of blood, which he imbibed with his mother’s milk, has been succeeded by his son who has been to Oxford or Cambridge, where he has mixed with the aristocrat of blood, and where his long purse enabled him to swell it with the bluest blooded of his set. And whilst he has been shedding his anti-aristocratic opinions, his “hands” in mill and factory have been awakening to the fact that the Radical employer is the scourge they feel. However much he may be taught to hate the landlord as the cause of the injustice he feels, the artisan isn’t brought into daily and hourly contact with him as he is with his employer, or the employer’s representative. And thus the breach is widening. For a time the Lancashire factory hand and miner voted largely Tory as a dumb protest against the growing oppression of his Radical employer. Now he finds himself as a Tory mostly in the same camp with his employer at election times, and he is casting about in his mind for an explanation. If he votes Liberal, it is for an employer; if he votes Tory, it is for an employer. And so, the fulness of time having come, the idea of a New Party which will not be an employers’ party, has taken hold, and has been baptized as the Independent Labour Party.

>The usual outcry has been raised among the “Scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites,” Why can’t the working-man be content to remain in the ranks of the Liberal party? He is implored and beseeched by the first officers of State, from the Prime Minister downwards, not to forsake Liberalism. Nay, a prominent man in the councils of Liberalism — the Right Honourable James Bryce — publicly advised the working-men if they were determined to leave the Liberal party to join the Tories in preference to the I.L.P., as the workman affectionately dubs his New Party. Were the Liberal party fit even for the work which it professes to have in hand, all this lugubrious appeal would be unnecessary. So long as Liberalism was able to meet and overcome the Tory opposition to political reform, so long had it a strong hold on the leading men in the ranks of Labour. Many of these still, for various reasons, give a more or less qualified adhesion to Liberalism, but these are not the men whom the Prime Minister addresses his appeals to. They are admittedly a waning influence. They are living on the traditions of past glories. The British workman admires pluck and spirit, and, whilst not agreeing it may be with everything said or done, would yet be difficult to wean from his allegiance to a fighting organisation. When, however, he sees Liberalism impotent in the House of Commons, and framing its measures not to meet the opinions of advanced men, but to suit the fears of the Tories, allowing the Lords to flout them with impunity, and quailing under the lash of the great liquor interest, he turns from it in derision as he would from a coward in the P.R.

>The business of the New Party is to do battle with Toryism. Before it can get to close quarters with the forces of reaction it must first clear from the path the impediment behind which Toryism shelters itself. The chief impediment is the Liberal Party. I take Toryism to represent existing monopolies, privileges, and abuses. These are chiefly social and economic. Life has become arid and barren. The instincts after better things are ruthlessly killed out by the overmastering demands of supplying mere physical requirements. Poetry and music are no longer part of the life of the people. The curse of gold is on the land and casts its baneful shadow over the race from the cradle to the grave. Our children grow up in great cities divorced from the great forces of Mother Nature. Everything around them is artificial and mostly unnatural. Our strong men pass their manhood under a veritable reign of terror, lest the opportunity to work for a living be suddenly denied them. Our aged have their declining years embittered by a system of relief which is designed to degrade and abase the recipients. The wives and mothers of the nation in whose hands are our future destinies, are either at work trying to eke out the husband’s earnings, or slaving at home and trying to perform impossibilities till temper and spirit both give way, and children are allowed to grow up anyhow. The tramp, tramp of the strong man out of work never ceases, and strange thoughts are beginning to find lodgment in the brains of these men, who find themselves left to starve because that pays the employer. Sir Isaac Holden, M.P., stated in the House of Commons during the Budget debate this year (1894) that, aided by machinery, forty men were now doing the work which 3000 were formerly required for. He boasted of this achievement. The next sentence declared that Parliament could not do anything for the unemployed. Sir Isaac Holden is a Liberal.

>In the midst of all this growing misery and discontent, the Liberal and Tory parties go on their way prating for and against Registration reform, Disestablishment, and the like. If the Tories, as the representatives of property, do nothing, no one has any reason to complain. But the Liberals! Don’t they represent the people? And they profess to feel surprised that the workers should dare form a party of their own. The wonder is that they haven’t done so long ago.

>The objects of the Independent Labour Party are clearly defined. It sets out from the assumption that the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of man are realities, and that our whole social and industrial system to-day is subversive of these relationships. People who find themselves possessed of money thereby acquire a direct interest in the oppression of the poor. The strong man is taught to use his strength for his own personal gain, irrespective of how it affects his fellows. Books have been written in praise of those who have “risen from the ranks,” as the phrase goes, to positions of proud eminence in the commercial or industrial world. Long ago, John Ruskin pointed out, as Herbert Spencer has done since, that Co-operation, and not Competition, is the Law of Life. In every relationship to-day Competition rules. The workman competes with his mates for the vacant job, and can only succeed in keeping it by continuing his competition with his work-fellows. The merchant, on the mart and in the Exchange, is deemed “successful” who outstrips his fellows in the competitive race for “markets.” The nations of the earth compete with each other for the possession of territory. “Bear ye one another’s burdens,” says Christ. “Get on,” says the modern economist — by fair means, if possible, but — get on! Nor is the reason for all this far to seek. So long as human nature remains what it is, the sight of means to do ill deeds will make ill deeds to be done, and the possession of power will lead to its abuse, when apparent self-interest demands.

>So long as land and industrial capital are the possession of the few, we may pass such ameliorative Acts as a “wise legislative assembly” may be coerced into accepting, but we shall not eradicate the root cause of the evil.

>To give the working-class the full fruit of its labour! Such, in a single sentence, is the object of the I.L.P.

>But how are we to realise the ideal? The man of the world advises caution and policy. If we attempt too much, we will in the end get nothing. Better accept half a loaf than go without bread. These and many other ancient maxims are preached unceasingly to the men of the New Party. Trust Liberalism, says the Liberal; trust Toryism, says the Tory. Hitherto the I.L.P. has turned a deaf ear to all such pleadings, and has preferred to “Trust in God and do the right.” If the Liberal Party were the rank and file, or even some of the members of the party in Parliament, the advice to trust that party would be all right. But these are not the party. These are the crutches on which the real party lean for support. The policy of the party is not shaped to suit the wants of the rank and file, but to catch their votes. It is the interests of the landlords and the capitalists who are in the party which decide its policy. So long as the workers can be kept divided over Disestablishment and the like, the landlord and the capitalist are safe in the enjoyment of their ill-gotten gains. It is political reforms which the Liberals make a feint of introducing and the Tories of opposing. What really concerns the moving spirits on both sides is the protection of their rent and interest. The programmes, and the opposition thereto, are mere blinds to keep the worker from laying a sacrilegious hand on these arks of the god Mammon. It is because the I.L.P. declines to be led off on this false issue that it is hated and feared. Vote for us and our programme, say the Liberals, or you will have the Tories and no Reform. By way of reply the I.L.P. points to America, where all the reforms proposed are already accomplished facts, and where the lot of labour is if anything more hapless than at home. Whether Tory or Liberal be in power matters absolutely nothing to the man whom starvation drives to suicide, or the veteran of industry sighing his life out in the workhouse. The calling of the prostitute goes on merrily despite changes of Government, and

>“On every wind of heaven
A wasted life goes by,”

>whether Lord Rosebery or the Marquis of Salisbury squats in Downing Street.

\- Hardie discussing where the left should go in British politics in 1894


>Section two of the Manifesto raises the question: “In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole?”

>(Proletariat I may explain for the benefit of young readers means working class, and Bourgeois, middle class.) This is how Marx answers the question :—

>The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to other working-class parties. They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole. They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.

>In the succeeding paragraphs he goes on to show that what distinguishes, them from others is that understanding, as they do, the true inwardness of the working-class movement, they are able to give it guidance and direction. They are on the one hand :—

>The most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all the others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement!

>Now nothing can be clearer than this. We may disagree with it, but we cannot misunderstand it.

>THE I.L.P. JUSTIFIED.

>The Socialist movement was not to be a thing apart from the general working-class movement, with its own tests and dogma, but an integral part of the movement, merely acting as the advanced guard, careful all the time not to get so far ahead as to be out of touch with the main body of the army. And this is exactly what the I.L.P. is, and always has been. The Trade Union movement is the real movement of the working class, and the I.L.P. is the advanced wing.

ukpolitics,post,ECHR,82okai,shieldofsteel,The road to Brexit - a personal journey,"Brexit. How did it come to this? As someone who was conflicted about the vote and who attempted to weigh up the arguments rationally, I would like to offer to the readers of reddit, a personal story of how my thinking evolved in the lead up to the vote, how I voted, and how my thoughts have developed since then. 

Rather than post a one-sided polemic, justifying a particular view, I want here to present my thoughts as accurately as I can describe them, including nuances and doubts along the way. That probably means I'll end up getting criticism from both sides - but perhaps some people might be interested and  appreciate it. So, here goes...

**About Me**

Demographic information: white male, 40s. Rural working class by family background; middle class by education and profession.

Voting affiliation: usually Conservative; formerly Liberal Democrat.

**Background**

I was never enthusiastic about the idea of the European Union, but rather saw it as a means to ensure trade and co-operation on a practical level. Certainly if you'd asked me 10 years ago, I would have argued that it's better to stay in to try to influence it for the better. But over the years, I had become less certain of this view, due to seemingly one-way ever-increasing centralization in the EU, towards something more akin to the United States. Actually worse, as I can foresee the EU taking more power from member states than does the US federal government, in some areas this is already the case in fact. At least the US has the 10th Amendment. But despite this strong skepticism of the EU institutions, I've always seen the other European countries as friendly, important allies, and want to see good trading, personal and cultural relationships across the continent of Europe. Therein lies my conflict.

**Influencing factors**

1. The Euro. A single currency for the whole of Europe! What could possibly go wrong? As we know, plenty did go wrong. Perhaps this was the first indicator that something was seriously wrong at the heart of the EU project. It seemed to confirm a suspicion: that the philosophy of centralization and political integration was more important than practical economics. A generation of EU politicians, who so believed in the project, seemed to have allowed their utopian vision to override practical, pragmatic considerations. Furthermore, as the EU gets ever increasing powers, it will inevitably be run more in the interests of Euro members. As a non-Euro member, the UK would be particularly exposed to being forced into things against its national interest.

2. Government by continent. I am in favour of international trade and co-operation. But I really don't see why this has to be done to such a large extent at continent level. The idea of the EU seems to be predicated on having strong border on the outside and you're either in it or out of it. Sure, on a practical level, there may be some need for some Europe-wide institutions, and there are plenty of EU agencies that I'd be happy to part of. But for me the EU goes way beyond what is necessary or desirable. My preferred model would be less tied to continental masses. Especially when it comes to western democracies: I see no reason why links with Canada or Australia must necessarily be lesser than those with European countries. I am also skeptical of the need or benefit of a ""European identity"" that is distinct from people in other continents. Like how UKIP supporters are sometimes branded ""little Englanders"", I think that fanatical EU supporters can equally be branded ""little Europeaners"". 

3. Localism. I am in favour of the decisions in general being taken and the most local level that makes practical sense. Indeed, the UK itself is too centralized too, and I would welcome more powers for cities and counties. Despite any claims to the contrary, the EU can and does make laws on things that could easily be left with member sates. The mantra is *harmonisation*, but that might be just another way of saying *centralized control*. Some things will necessarily require international bodies to decide upon, but where this is necessary, in many cases it might make more sense to have global bodies rather than continental ones.

4. The votes for prisoners judgement by the ECHR. It might seem esoteric - and before people jump in to say it: yes I know the ECHR is not an EU institution. But there was a lesson to be learned here, so let me explain. This was an outrageous decision and an affront to democracy. I was disgusted. Not just at the decision, which was offensive enough, but at the fact that there was apparently nothing that could be done about it. A court had ruled it, so that was that. In my view, the UK should have immediately left the ECHR in protest at this decision. Don't get me wrong, I am in favour of human rights law, and would happily subscribe to the basic text of European Convention on Human Rights. But what we had here was unaccountable judges overstepping their remit into areas of political policy, without being subject to democratic accountability: If it had been a UK judge, at least the Parliament could subsequently change the law. What this case showed to me, more than anything, was the absolute and critical importance of sovereignty and democratic accountability in a political system. While the ECHR might be relatively easily ignored for now, clearly this represents a danger: future outrageous judgements, perhaps next time by the ECJ, would be binding. So while not directly an EU issue, this case for me was critical in developing my thinking about questions of sovereignty.

5. The awkward UK. It always seems to be that we are the ones that are holding things in the EU back. Personally, I can't really understand why other countries seem happy to subordinate themselves. But if that's what they want, maybe we should just get out of the way and let them get on with it. On the other hand, by staying in, perhaps we could find common cause with others to offer a different vision for Europe - one that is more strictly limited to the practical needs of co-operation over trade.

**The lead up to the vote**

When the referendum was announced, I wasn't clear how I would vote. I decided I would wait and see what David Cameron came back with after negotiating a so-called ""reformed EU"" package. Sadly, the answer was *not much*. Even in the face of one if its biggest members and contributors having serious doubts about even remaining a member, the inflexibility and zeal from the EU was undiminished. They were willing to call our bluff.

I listened to the debates. Both campaigns in truth were awful. Whether it was the £350 million we send to the EU, or the £4300 a year worse off, there were stupid statistics being thrown around on both sides. The one thing that cut through was the ""take back control"" message. The reason this resonated, in my view, was that is crystallised in a neat phrase the pre-existing concerns over the sovereignty question.

Apart from the fears that the economy would be worsened if we left, I don't remember a single convincing pro-EU argument being made from the Remain side. It might be have been put: ""Vote Remain - the EU is a necessary evil""!

If we were to Leave, I could see, there would be short term uncertainty and turmoil, and it would give the politicians on both sides of the channel a big headache. On the other hand, if we were to Remain, the forces in favour of centralizing the EU would see it as tacit approval for their plans. Still, leaving outright felt too extreme to me, too drastic. I was also put off by some of the more strident anti-immigration messages that were coming from certain Leave extremists, but there were plenty of mainstream politicians arguing what seemed to be a reasonable case for Leave (and I'm not counting Boris in that list). I found myself wishing there were another other alternative, a middle ground. But, it was a binary choice, so I had to pick a side.

What should I do? In the end, I couldn't see how I could vote for doing nothing, which is what a Remain vote would be. A message had to be sent. Even if, as the polls were saying, Remain would win, a very close result might at least act as a warning. 

**The day of the vote**

With some mixed feelings, I voted Leave.

**The immediate aftermath**

Watched the results coming in with some surprise, to say the least! Did I feel happy or joyful that my ""side"" had won? No, not really. I felt trepidation. Had I done the right thing? In truth, I wasn't sure. But, had I voted Remain and that side had won, I'm sure I would have felt a different set of anxieties - the consequence of having a vote where neither option is entirely satisfactory. The trouble with being on the winning side, is you are then partly responsible for what follows. There is a certain joyful freedom about being on the losing side - you can take the moral high ground at anything that goes wrong subsequently. Still, I did have a sense of optimism that despite the initial upheaval, a new beginning where the country reconnects more directly to the wider world was possible.

**Events since the vote**

There have been two events since the referendum that have caused me to question my vote:

1. Calling the 2017 general election. I am completely with *Brenda from Bristol* here. Having triggered Article 50, you would think the government would have been fully concentrating on the exit process and preparing a sensible new arrangement. But no, instead Mrs May decides to put selfish party advantage before that of the country. Although I was angry about that, I still voted Conservative, as the best hope for a decent Brexit deal.

2. The election of Donald Trump. What a disaster: America first, protectionism, and anti-free trade. My Leave vote had been in large part to have *more* global links and co-operation, but now this vision seemed a lot less likely. Leave and Trump voters are often mentioned in the same sentence, but my definition of Leave is virtually the complete opposite of Trump's policies. 

**Current state of play**

So how do I feel now? I still hope that a decent deal can be found that maximises trade and co-operation, but at a level that the UK as a whole feels comfortable with, both Leave and Remain voters. However I have my doubts, the referendum has opened up a cultural division that I don't see disappearing even after Brexit is complete. The whole country is still polarized as ever, and the issue has now become a matter of political identity - something I regret. 

Unsurprisingly, the EU institutions are intransigent and inflexible as ever, so getting a decent deal is not going to be easy. Does that mean Brexit should be cancelled and revert to the status quo? I don't see how that can happen either, the mistrust and negative feeling toward the EU institutions has only grown, and I wouldn't feel optimistic about that option either - the issues outlined above with the EU would still be there if we remained in on the same terms.

In summary, I still have *some* hope that Leave will turn out to be the best long-term option, given the unfortunate binary nature of the vote, but wish a different solution could have been found - a genuinely reformed EU - that would have avoided having the vote in the first place, and potentially have been a more satisfactory outcome all round.

Phew, that about sums it all up. Thanks for reading this long post.

*Edit: Some have asked me about the future arrangement and what kind of deal I think there should be, so I'm going to add a new section:*

**Future**

I support the ongoing negotiations, and subscribe neither to the ""relax, everything will be great"" blind optimism of some Brexiteers, nor the ""everything will be disaster, cancel it at once"" cries of some Remainers. I think in the end, if a sensible compromise is found, it'll probably be less of a big deal than people are expecting. People will adapt to the new system and carry on as normal. 

As a mere layperson I can't say *exactly* what I think the deal should be, but my desire for us to be more interconnected directly with the wider world necessitates leaving the customs union - otherwise, there isn't really any point in Brexit at all! I am open to exploring EFTA-style arrangements though if they can be made fair to both sides. 

The atmosphere is tense at the moment but I think we all need to take a breath, remain calm, and hold our nerve, and then assess the final deal (both economic and sovereignty-wise) once negotiations are complete.
