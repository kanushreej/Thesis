AskUK,comment,carbon,h126oh4,seefroo,,"Absolutely nobody because that isn’t how it works.

Say I own a factory and I produce 1000 tonnes of CO2 a year. I identify a way to cut my CO2 output by 10%, or 100 tonnes. I need to prove I’ve done this to the Department of Energy and Climate Change, who will then issue me 100 “carbon credit certificates” (one for each tonne).

I can then sell them on the open market through the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS).

Now let’s say you’ve started producing a new product and it’s not carbon neutral, instead it’s producing 50 tonnes of CO2 per year. You can offset this by buying 50 of my certificates. I’ll have a price I want to sell them for - probably about the cost of the changes I made to get those certificates - and you’ll have a price you want to buy them for - less than it would cost you than to actually cut down on the CO2 production. We would hopefully meet more or less in the middle.

The scheme is certainly not without its faults but it has created a marketplace whereby companies and organisations can actually get paid - indeed they can even *profit* - from cutting their carbon emissions. The theory is that it encourages companies to continue cutting emissions, particularly those that weren’t cost effective, because suddenly they can actually be paid to do it. And companies that want to increase emissions for whatever reason have to pay for it.

So the company in your example can claim to be “carbon neutral” because they’ve essentially paid other companies to use less equivalent carbon than them. And with the laws of supply and demand if there are less certificates on the market then the price rises, meaning more companies will reduce emissions because they can make more money doing so.

There are other “plant a tree” schemes where companies can pay a certain amount to companies whose purpose is to plant trees, thus meaning they can plant more trees, but that’s not as widespread. It’s mostly about the certificates.

But in essence it means that, by this definition, electric carbon neutral cars **are** carbon neutral. No new carbon is being added to the atmosphere through their production, because they’re using carbon which has already been removed. It’s a bit of a roundabout way of putting it admittedly, but that’s how it works.",2021-06-08T18:45:35+00:00

How bad could it be?,"Context: [The Conservative government (Vote Leave government) ends steel import restrictions, UK steel has to compete with China's state-subsidised steel industry.](https://www.reddit.com/r/brexit/comments/nxzsl2/uk_steel_industry_fury_as_government_looks_to/)

# **What about free trade?**

**First** of all. This is NOT ""free"" trade what China is doing (Google ""china steel subsidies""). Subsidies the size of the smallest European countries annual GDP, created out of thin air (central bank, shadow banking) is NOT ""free"" trade.

**Second.** Think about steel as a basic necessity ([the commanding hights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfRTpoYpHfw)) for an advanced and sizable economy, in a [G Zero world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Nation_for_Itself), and in the context of ""Global Britain"" and the recent experience with Hong Kong. 

It poses a (diplomatic) security and economic risk.

If the UK becomes dependent on 'China steel' (and only gets a trickle/left overs from Europe/what Europe can spare at very high prices), the UK (""Global Britain"") would lose its diplomatic and economic sanctions strength (teeth) against China, if China were to actually start a war or a proxy war over Taiwan.[1] A toothless ""Global Britain."" 

The best example at the moment for such a scenario is [the China-Australia skirmish](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-26/the-collateral-damage-of-australia-trade-war-with-china-/100071952)[2], and how politically and economically accommodating Australia is because they have no counterweights (their hands are tied). Letting things slide. Just in order not to lose even more trade. You could argue Australia has become a playball of China. All because some political far-right 'heavyweights' have pressed the Australian far-right government to investigate the origins of COVID and China's cover-up. As if that does not sound familiar ... * *looks towards the far-right press landscape of the UK.* *

Not having a basic domestic production capacity is a short-sighted 'Tory' move. As if the lessons from COVID (not having own basic PPE production supply chain in UK/Europe) have not been learned. Or computer chip production.[1]

**Further**, it is an insidious way to lower the UK CO2 footprint (if you don't count CO2 imports). Just deindustrialise the country. Really!? This Conservative government is saving billions not having to rejig and modernise the energy infrastructure (hydropower storage, hydrogen storage & increase renewables) to run heavy (energy-intensive) industry like steel or car production.

These are my thoughts responding to ['what about free trade don't you get?'](https://www.reddit.com/r/brexit/comments/nxzsl2/uk_steel_industry_fury_as_government_looks_to/h1hvaxf/) eg /u/denuvosuks & /u/willie_caine

[1] The world (global supply chain of car, medical, computer, phone, entertainment, military industry, appliances) is dependent [(50% market share)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_industry_in_Taiwan) on Taiwan as chip manufacture (especially the new smallest & fastest stuff). [Taiwan is also experiencing a record drought due to climate change.](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/taiwan-drought-highlights-water-stress-as-growing-environmental-risk-04-05-2021) And then there is the growing risk of China starting a war over Taiwan.[$] **These THREE (3) risks** are the reasons why the [USA](https://electronics360.globalspec.com/article/16465/report-tsmc-plans-to-now-spend-35b-in-arizona-fab) and the [European Union](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-seeks-8-bln-euros-subsidies-european-chip-plant-politico-2021-04-30/) are in talks (or have started) to build new government subsidised fabrication plants with Intel and TSMC - in the USA and European Union, to be less dependent on Taiwan.

AskUK,comment,climates,jjvzj5i,JakeArcher39,,"Thanks for your thoughtful comment, its always interesting to see people from different parts of the world's reactions to our climate. 

On-and-off rain is definitely a key feature of the British Isles. Funnily enough though, the UK doesn't actually have particularly high total annual rainfall in mm...because it usually doesn't rain *that* heavily (as opposed to alot of other countries, where it might not be raining many days, but when it does rain, it hammers down).  It just rains on alot of days over the course of the whole year. 

The maritime climate and humidity we have means that it often does feel quite mild. This is why you'll hear Brits saying things like ""20c in England just isn't the same as 20c in Spain, it feels hotter in England!"". 

The days will get even longer by June and July. If you go up to North Scotland, it never actually gets pitch-black at night in midsummer...just twilight. You can see the Northern Lights there if you're lucky. 

In regards to your clothes, I would suggest using an umbrella, if you're not already, one of those fold-up / portable ones so you can give it a permanent place in your bag/backpack whilst out and about. Otherwise, yes, you can easily get caught in a heavy shower when it was sunny just 15 mins earlier. 

I will add a caveat - this Spring is a particularly grim/wet/dull, even by British standards. As a point of comparison, last May saw 10 days across the month of 20c or above (quite normal) this year we've had just 1 day. It's apparently the wettest spring in London specifically, since 1980.

>Whether violent crime is up or down depends on which figures you look at. The Office for National Statistics thinks that overall, all crime including violent crime is falling, but there is evidence of recent rises in certain less common, but very serious crimes, including murder.

>The homicide rate has been creeping up over the past couple of years, after significant decreases since the early 2000s.

>But there's no evidence to link this to a fall in the use of stop and search powers.

>It's very difficult to pinpoint a single cause driving changes in crime.

>Big reductions to the number of police officers and to forces' budgets since 2010 have piled on the pressure.

>It's not clear whether that has contributed to the rise in some crimes. 

No evidence of causation, not even really a clear correlation. By scientific standards there is nothing really there, just a few straws for the right to grasp at to validate their ideological position on crime.

https://fullfact.org/crime/does-stop-search-work/

>Does stop and search work as a deterrent?

>The evidence on stop and search suggests it is not a particularly good deterrent.

>A recent paper by Professor Bradford and colleagues Dr Matteo Tiratelli and Dr Paul Quinton says:

>“We used ten years of police, crime and other data from London to investigate the potential effect of stop and search on crime.

>“We find that S&S has only a very weak and inconsistent association with crime. While there is some correlation, most notably in relation to drug offences, we conclude that the deterrent effect of S&S is likely to be small, at best…

>“We struggled to find evidence of an effect of S&S on violent crime.”

>They found that after a 10% increase in stop and search during a given month, recorded drug offences would be 1.85% lower during the next month, while non-domestic violent crime was 0.01% lower.

>Another study into stop and search’s deterrent effects was the Home Office’s analysis of the outcomes of Operation BLUNT 2.

>It said: “Overall, analysis shows that there was no discernible crime-reducing effects from a large surge in stop and search activity at the borough level during the operation.”

>However the paper does note that “it does not necessarily follow that stop and search activity does not reduce crime.

>“It is possible that there are localised crime-reducing effects of stop and search activity that are masked when analysing data on such a large geographic area.”

>Slightly more positive findings come from New York City, where an evaluation of Operation Impact, an initiative where more police were deployed to high crime areas (“impact zones”) and encouraged to conduct investigative stops, found:

>“Impact zones were also significantly associated with increases in investigative stops for suspected crimes, but only the increase in stops made based on probable cause indicators of criminal behaviors were associated with crime reductions.

>“However, probable cause-related stops were a relatively small fraction of the total number of investigative stops, suggesting that there were excess stops that had little crime suppression benefits.”

>Does it work as an investigative power?

>An investigative power could be seen as effective in two broad ways. One is that the power allows the police to detect a crime that has not yet been detected (for example possession of drugs or weapons). The other is the police find something that helps them solve a crime they have already detected.

>As an investigative power, there is evidence that stop and search “works”, at least in the sense that stop and search leads to the police uncovering more crimes, particularly drug offences.

>Across England and Wales in 2017/18 around 30% of stops and searches led to what’s called a “positive outcome.” This refers to cases where action is taken against people who were stopped and searched. This includes arrest cases but also covers other resolutions like warnings and Penalty Notices.

>In London 60% of positive outcomes were related to drug offences, 11% to theft, fraud and counterfeit offences, and 9% were for “weapons, points and blades”.

>There is an open question as to whether stop and search is better than other investigatory powers.

>Professor Bradford told us, in relation to crimes of drug possession: “Without stop and search the police would be arresting more people to investigate these crimes. It is more efficient to search them.”

>Dr Tiratelli on the other hand told us: “Stop and search is used very differently by different police forces, indicated by the level of use.

>“The Met see it as an essential investigatory tool, while other police forces, for example Essex, find other powers which they use to investigate crime.”

>So stop and search may be an efficient way to detect certain types of crimes but it doesn’t appear to be universally embraced by police forces as an essential investigatory tool.
What is the opposition to stop and search?

>Whether or not stop and search is effective either as a deterrent or investigatory power, this needs to be considered alongside its possible negative effects.

>The College of Policing says: “There are substantial risks associated with stop and search being used incorrectly or inappropriately.”

>“Disproportionate use of stop and search against particular social groups—most notably black and minority ethnic groups and young people—may increase their perception that they are being targeted unfairly.

>Black people are nearly ten times as likely to be stopped and searched as white people. Three in every 1,000 white people were stopped and searched in 2017/18, compared to 29 in every 1,000 black people.

>The College of Policing continues: “Perceptions of the police making unfair decisions and being disrespectful are linked with lower levels of police legitimacy.

>“This in turn reduces the public’s willingness to not break the law and cooperate with the police, eg, by not reporting crime, suspicious activity or providing information.

>“This is likely to make the police’s job harder in the long run.”

>Polling by Yougov on behalf of the Criminal Justice Alliance in 2017 found a significant proportion (36%) of young BAME people have less trust in the police because of what they know about stop and search.

It's not a great case for it and the thin evidence there is that it might have some positive effect is massively outweighed by the problems it causes which in the longrun hurt police and communities more than they help them.

Edit: and forgot to point out that when a lot of the ""success"" is about drugs that is an area with the strongest case for reform having a much better impact (and doesn't hurt people's rights and freedom). 

There is no hard evidence basis for this approach to policing. It's an ideological position based on how the right think crime and policing should be managed, not based on the evidence. This is further reinforced by how you will find the right often oppose actual evidence based policy that does not fit with their wordlview. For example drug reform is rejected on the right often for reasons that have nothing to do with evidence on preventing crime and reducing addiction/harm. It's on that same basis they are so keen to extend or protect police powers.",2022-01-27T23:00:51+00:00

Complete mis-information. I don't have a link to the source to hand, but some researchers (I think it was Imperial College) worked out that if all cars switched to electric overnight it would increase the UK's electricity usage by less than a ~~20%~~ (edit: 10% according to National Grid, see below) increase, and in the past 20 years our electricity usage has dropped by a ~~little over 20%~~  (edit: 16% according to National Grid, see below) due to efficiency improvements across the board. So sure, energy companies & government need to plan for demand to rise a bit but it's absolutely doable especially if we speed ahead with more domestic wind farms.

edit: I'd probably mis-remembered the numbers slightly, the National Grid themselves confirm what I said though:

> *The most demand for electricity in recent years in the UK was for 62GW in 2002. Since then, the nation’s peak demand has fallen by roughly 16% due to improvements in energy efficiency.*

> *Even if we all switched to EVs overnight, we believe demand would only increase by around 10%. So we’d still be using less power as a nation than we did in 2002 and this is well within the range of manageable load fluctuation.*

Projects go round and round in circles defining a problem and suggesting/designing solutions that we know will not be accepted because we are not allowed to know certain information or just have to go through the process first. We have to optioneer and design full solutions just to prove that a solution will not work before we can go back to suggest what has previously been proven to work or a viable solution is canned because the management tasked to the project changes and the new person decides they don't like a particular solution when the previous one did. This Wastes years of effort and money.

Every solution is looked at in isolation and we are not allowed to discuss how it might affect other parts of the design until we reach an appropriate stage and then someone suddenly says ""oh no it won't work because it clashes with this other sub system, optioneer and design a new system"". It was obvious from the beginning it was going to clash but that's not what your particular task is so follow the procedure. repeat ad nauseum

Don't even get me started on documents that are checked line by line. As soon as there is an issue it is returned for resubmission.

 The problem is one we've never faced before, requiring applied individual responsibility, even behind closed doors; rather than by convenient, standardised government intervention: 'automatic for the people' a la carte. 'I'm alright jack' / 'fuck you buddy' attitudes will hinder efforts, as no one wants to risk impinging upon their own quality of life more than their neighbour's sacrifice - everyone must be singing from the same hymn sheet.

A way to balance that would be shifting veto power to for example the Council of Ministers instead of the Council of Europe and raising the bar to something like 25% or 1/3rd. Of note is that if tomorrow the European Parliament would hold all the power then it's people from the large countries being less represented.

Per capita you guys have way [more MEPs than Germany for example](https://i.imgur.com/37wDexS.png) (map from 2014) and are stronger represented.

Obviously there always needs to be a balance which most countries solve with multiple chambers - one which is proportionate and one which represents the national interests in this case. 

But trying to agree on anything when something like 15% of countries (4/28) can veto things is just an impossible mess in the long term.

And you are desperate to sing our praises, hence why you have totally failed to engage with my comment, aside from selectively misinterpreting a small section of it and hitting the downvote button.

Or maybe you don't have an agenda, just like I don't have an agenda, and we merely have a difference of opinion. Maybe personal insults are totally uncalled for in this discussion.

>Yeah - but it is now 2018. And the onboarding of a shedload of windfarms between 2012 and 2018 means we have hit out targets.

Those targets you are talking about are inadequate to hit 2C, even assuming shitloads of carbon capture. See the first link in my comment.

>https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-carbon-emissions-in-2017-fell-to-levels-last-seen-in-1890
>I know you are desperate to shit on the UK - but using data from 6 years ago is a pretty misleading way to do it.

Let me explain this again.

In 2012, we had made reductions of 25% since 1990. Sounds alright. Except not so much when you consider that much of our manufacturing has been sent overseas since then - cars to Germany, electronics to China, for example. It is an easy way of taking carbon off our books and putting them on someone else's, but we can't do it forever - at some point you run out of manufacturing to offshore, and then emissions reductions will get harder. Which means apparently high reductions today are no promise of high reductions tomorrow. 

It also forgets that we have a responsibility to not buy things that ultimately result in carbon being produced, even if that's from some other country's factory. When our imported goods are accounted for, in 2012 we had only made 7% reductions. We don't have new data for 2018, but the 38% figure you cite is calculated in the same way as the 25% figure from 2012 - it leaves out imports. Once those are considered the number will be considerably less impressive.

I am not trying to shit on the UK. I am trying to save it.

Conversely, perceptions are that the UK and its populous aren't going to see much financial benefit from fracking, while it's the citizens who bear the risk.

The European Union (EU) Framework Programmes (FPs) should have provided a fresh opportunity, but their bureaucracy often surpassed the already cumbersome mechanisms present in many European countries. In the early 2000s, even finding project calls on the Commission's research website was extremely difficult.

Self employed covers a very broad range of people, and a very broad range of income. But when you think about it logically, there is very little help available to them (if it remains at simply UC). 


Companies of all sizes will have their staffs wages covered, as well as various grants and loans to make sure they don't fail.


Employed people will have their wages covered by the government, and while there will obviously be job losses it should be fairly minimal (considering the government is footing the bill).

Meanwhile, self employed people will be entitled to UC to keep both their business and personal life above water. It's fair enough saying ""that's capitalism"" and all that jazz, but that's not what's happening. Let us all fail? fair enough. But it's not a level playing field if the government decides to bailout the rest of the economy and not this one particular section. 

You cant just say ""self employed people should have been prepared for this"" while also saying ""businesses could have never seen this coming and it's not their fault or their employees, let's keep them afloat during this crisis"".

And also, a large portion of ""self employed people"" are basically employed in all but name. I'm one of them myself.

brexit,comment,disasters,euavipm,TheShreester,,"""**You've ignored the most significant voter demographic from the 2016 referendum. AGE.** Broadly speaking, people voted Leave or Remain in similar numbers across the UK and even in London and Scotland there wasn't an overwhelming majority either way (it was 60:40 instead of 50:50), however _there was a clear division in preference between older votes and younger ones._

Every year that passes without the UK leaving the EU some of those older, predominantly Leave voters are replaced by new, younger voters who are more likely to vote Remain. A decade later, assuming no significant changes to the state of the country, this shift in sentiment would probably be enough to ensure a clear Remain majority.

Another important factor, in addition to the referendum result itself, is the Brexit position of UK political parties. The UK is a representative democracy and the referendum was only advisory (not legally binding), so the opinions of MPs matter but are no longer representative of the electorate because of the UK's archaic FPTP electoral system. 

The Conservatives have so far been the ONLY mainstream pro-Leave party because, despite the popular support enjoyed by UKIP (and now the Brexit party), the UK's FPTP electoral system makes it difficult for them to translate this into MPs, which prevented UKIP from taking parliamentary seats in 2010, despite obtaining 14% of the vote. 

_Ironically, it was the recent EU elections, which gave the Brexit party proportional representation in the EU parliament._ **Yes, that's correct, the EU election was more democratic for Leavers than the UK election!** One of the potential upsides to this Brexit fiasco is that it has highlighted how badly the UK parliament and elections are in need of reform, something which isn't supported by either Labour or the Conservatives who stand to lose from such changes. _Perhaps a referendum is needed on this issue instead?_

Labour under Corbyn has been sitting on the fence, officially claiming they support the decision to Leave, while undermining attempts to do so in parliament. Why? Because  the probability of a general election increases the longer they stall, especially if the UK doesn't Brexit on Oct 31. However, even if they come to power, Labour will want their own democratic mandate before either proceeding with negotiations or revoking Article 50, which means a second referendum in 2020/2021 followed by either a softer Brexit or none at all.",2019-07-20T14:33:34+00:00

This literally contains no primary data. It is a literature review on BAME interactions and health outcomes stating their is systemic racism published in 2022 that only mentions vaccinations once. That quite simply shows they cherry picked the studies to include. Vaccine hesitancy amongst ethnic minorities also explains many different health outcomes


>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lammy-review-final-report

The Lammy report is from 2017, any reason you chose to ignore the more modern report from 2021 by A commission on race and ethnic minorities?

The one that found their isn't evidence of health disparities and used primary evidence?

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/974507/20210331_-_CRED_Report_-_FINAL_-_Web_Accessible.pdf 

>In examining this theme, the Commission has carefully considered the available evidence, and engaged widely with relevant experts and frontline workers.

>An analysis of available evidence into health disparities has shown again just how inappropriate it is to consider these issues under the term ‘BAME’ as there are such deep differences in the prevalence and outcome of some health conditions both between and within ethnic 
groups in the UK.

>The Commission rejects the common view that ethnic minorities have universally worse health outcomes compared with White people, the picture is much more variable. From the evidence reviewed the following conclusions have been drawn:

>For many key health outcomes, including life expectancy, overall mortality and many of the leading causes of mortality in the UK, ethnic minority groups have better outcomes than the White population. This evidence clearly suggests that ethnicity is not the major 
driver of health inequalities in the UK but deprivation, geography and differential exposure to key risk factors.

>Given that most ethnic minorities have higher levels of deprivation, compared with the White majority population, these health outcomes clearly suggest that deprivation is not destiny. More needs to be done to investigate why some ethnic minority groups are doing better than others, exploring whether it is due to differences in important risk factors, family structures, better social networks, or health behaviours such as drinking alcohol and smoking.

>For some health conditions there is variation within the broader ethnic group. For example, the risk for many cancers had significant differences for Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups.

>For COVID-19 and many other health conditions there is a complex interplay of socio-economic, behavioural, cultural and, in some cases, genetic risk factors, which 
lead to disparitie

>The Commission heard evidence which, in contrast to the narrative of other reports, suggests there is no overwhelming evidence of racism in the treatment and diagnosis  of mental health conditions. In this area in particular, far more research is needed to 
understand the interplay of different causes, and to understand the impact of issues such as mistrust of the health services among some groups.",2023-01-01T22:58:39+00:00

brexit,comment,earth,f3hie7d,CraigGB68,,"Our story begins, as these stories often do, with a young, up-and-coming politician. He's a deeply religious man and a member of the Conservative Party. He's completely single-minded and has no regard for the political process. The more power he attains, the more obvious his zealotry and the more aggressive his supporters become. Eventually, his party launches a special project in the name of ""national security"". At first, it's believed to be a search for biological weapons and is pursued without regard to its cost. However, the true goal of this project is power, complete and total hegemonic domination. The project, however, ends violently; but the efforts of those involved are not in vain, for a new ability to wage war is born from the blood of one of the victims. Imagine a virus, the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you, and you alone, have the cure. But if your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such a weapon? It's at this point in our story that along comes a spider. He i s a man seemingly without a conscience, for whom the ends always justify the means, and it is he who suggests that their target should not be an enemy of the country but rather the country itself. Three targets are chosen to maximise the effect of the attack: a school, a tube station, and a water treatment plant. Several hundred die within the first few weeks. Fueled by the media, fear and panic spread quickly, fracturing and dividing the country until, at last, the true goal comes into view. Before the St Mary's crisis, no-one would have predicted the results of the election that year. No-one. And then, not long after the election, lo and behold, a miracle. Some believe it was the work of God himself, but it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members that made them all obscenely rich. A year later, several extremists are tried, found guilty, and executed, while a memorial is built to canonise their victims. But the end result, the true genius of the plan, was the fear. Fear became the ultimate tool of this government, and through it, our politician was ultimately appointed to the newly-created position of high chancellor.

It would be utterly insane for the EU to do that for any country, and doubly so to do that to strike a deal with a country that is leaving the EU.  This is why you have situations like Norway, who are part of the EEA, but not part of the EU, which means they enjoy the benefit of having free movement of services, people and most goods, but they have the obligation of keeping regulatory parity with the EU.  They also have the right to participate in many of the EU's initiatives and projects, but have the obligation of having to financially contribute to the running of them.  However, for many of the hardline Brexiteers, it's now the case that the UK adopting the 'Norway model' is not really Brexit, despite some of them, in the past, actually holding up Norway as a reason why Brexit wouldn't be that bad, as the UK could end up like that.",2019-06-21T19:36:12+00:00

Now, despite being male, being young and more than happy to be a catty bitch, the girls were all fairly open.

Period issues were the only one's I never argued back on. Approved it everytime. I did have the condition though that they made steps towards being able to manage it, as having half the staff off at the same time was a royal ballache for me and my lowely salary, since I was covering most of it.

As long as you can show you're making progress on finding a solution (Which you can once you have the referral etc) then take the time off. It's valid. What I think wouldn't be okay is to continue to take time off every 21 ish days and do nothing about it.

IF you don't have this then it's likely at some point they will end up letting you go, this is very unlikely if you're upfront and honest about what's going on and what you're doing about it.

No, not virtually anyone can use the pound it has been stated we will completely lose access to using the pound as our own currency as has been stated by westminister. Go look it up. 

In the years 2022-2026 we will get a block grant of £41 billion a year from the uk goverment, go ahead and try to say how we can survive without that? We have been getting that block grant yearly for years.

Scotland has to fund its new independent Scotland some way and they have no more uk support to rely on oohhhhh and guess where the money will have to come from now? THE PEOPLE. Cause all the big name businesses with any sense will migrate straight to England with a secure economy so there goes a lot of corproration tax MAKING THE TAX FOR THE PEOPLE EVEN HIGHER.

Oh and that last statement? Completely incorrect. When big name businesses can no longer afford to pay their workers high wages guess what happens? Those workers stop spending, and guess what happens with that? Other businesses get less revenue, can pay their own workers less and so on. So all the “rich corrupt tories” suddenly start watching their Pennie’s and bam everyone gets hit cause ALL employers can no longer afford to pay high wages and ALL people will spend less leading to a cycle of decline in the Scottish economy.

From there:

>Germany built the most new capacity last year, thanks to its rapid ongoing onshore wind expansion. After Germany, the Netherlands built the most thanks to their record new offshore wind installations. Sweden was third with 1.9 GW of new capacity installed, all onshore.

>We expect the EU to install 200 GW of new wind power capacity over 2024-2030 - 29 GW a year on average. To meet its 2030 climate and energy targets the EU now needs to build 33 GW a year on average.

>736 MW of wind power capacity was decommissioned in
Europe in 2023. Germany accounted for almost three-quar-
ters of this figure (534 MW).
Of the 18.3 GW installed in 2023, 1.4 GW were repowered
projects. The total capacity repowered rose for the fifth year
in a row, and was the highest of the last ten years.

>Most wind farms reaching the end-of-life stage currently
opt for some form of lifetime extension, not only because of
the current economic situation, but often because legislative
frameworks for repowering are not yet in place.

>Wind energy met 12% of total demand in the EU in 2018,
and in 2023 it covered 19%, up from 16% in 2022. In general,
capacity factors for wind turbines grow over time as turbine
technology improves. Many countries have seen rising fleet-
wide capacity factors over the past few years as they install
more modern turbines.",2024-02-28T05:42:54+00:00

For a single bat in someone's roof I have to fill out 3 separate documents, two of which are 10+ pages long. It is just not necessary.

To also echo another sentiment in this thread. Developers are often extremely incompetent and repeatedly file for planning permission despite knowing the ecological requirements. We often have to deal with clients that say they need their surveys 'fast-tracked' because they've already filed for permission and need the surveys.

It is also clear how beneficial these processes have been, whether they are long and cumbersome or not. Ever since they have been introduced, bat numbers have been on the rise, and I assume it is the same for great crested newts.",2020-07-01T02:29:40+00:00

Because democracies and the political process doesn't exist in a vacuum. Subjective personal opinion is pretty important, liking a party leader, especially where there has been a more 'presidential' presentation is bizarrely important for a lot of people, group opinion is a thing, the media is one cog, and an increasing less relevant one. I mean in that context the UK political process has had less direct influence from the mass media recently than previously, and mass media tends to reflect public views as much as it influences people.

Take [this from the LSE](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/medialse/2019/12/05/elections-where-has-migration-gone/
):

*... This shift in tabloid, right-leaning media coverage of migration is of course complex, but a number of developments in recent years have played their part. An Ipsos Mori longitudinal public opinion study shows that in 2005, opinions on migration were primarily affiliated with newspaper readership (with readers of the Daily Mail, the Daily Express and the Sun being more concerned about migration and the readers of the Guardian less so). However, by 2015, the influence of the press had reduced significantly, with attitudes on migration among readers of the same newspapers varying significantly. This finding is likely to reflect the growing significance of social media in shaping public opinion, and certainly shows the waning influence the press.*

Again, if we look at the Corbyn phenomenon honestly rather than in a partisan fashion (I voted for Burnham because I think he'd make a good leader, is a genuinely decent MP and I spent a lot of time campaigning in Manchester albeit not in Leigh, with people who had campaigned for him..), it's pretty clear that he didn't need to be taken down by the media, and that there wasn't a need to manufacture opposition. He was and remains pretty massively divisive both within the party and outside of it.  There were so many failures in the run up to 2019 that the media coverage being negative is not surprising at all, and not an indication of manipulation by 'the elites'. 

You can throw in that even the UK's traditional media landscape is hardly massively out of tune with public opinion and sits largely centrally (bar on a few issues for a few papers...), with a reasonable left/right coverage across the board.

europe,comment,fossil fuels,ebp6my9,silverionmox,,">If you want energy on the short-term instead of fossil fuels, we simply don't have the tech yet to store green energy only and run on it 24/7. 

As it happens, we don't have the capacity yet to do that either. So we're still going to be increasing renewable capacity for quite a while, the coal plants will need to be closed first, and logically we'll keep the gas to be phased out last.

When we do arrive at the point where we'll need an additional way to balance supply and demand, then that will start replacing gas. I think methane synthesis will be a part of that, and we can keep using the old gas infrastructure, saving time and money.

>You NEED nuclear to close the gap towards full green energy if you want to get rid of fossil fuels at this specific moment in time. There is no other way right now to generate enough electricity otherwise to keep everything running.

Nuclear plants aren't very good at filling in the gaps. Their capacity factor drops and their costs consequently increase, and on top of that they need more maintenance too. They can potentially have some use in places where neither wind or sun is good enough, but the fuel supply isn't unlimited either, so don't count on it.

Furthermore, they tend to suck up investment capital and compete with renewables for flexible capacity. They really are cuckoo chicks. A 1-on-1 replacement of coal plants would be justifiable, but not at the expensive of renewable expansion.",2018-12-13T14:40:22+00:00

wowowow, calm down, when did I say they shouldn't exist? what sane person would say that? I'm saying that they should probs be capped at a manageable level so that the waste they produce remains manageable. this is even more pressing if you happen to have stored it somewhere the sea might be in 50 years time.

as for the working times thing, you wouldn't have to stagger the working hours that much in order to smooth out the peaks quite a lot. think about it - you could stagger finishing/start times in 15 mins progressively either side, but maybe you wouldn't have to. You could exploit timezone differences between countries (maybe member states) or make the timezones more distinct where they aren't currently, which would enable countries not at peak usage to facilitate the peaks of other countries, but ppl smarter than me have this better worked out. with numbers and shit. someone's probs done a decent paper on it but I can't be arsed with that shit. I might google it later, see if I can find something.

> I've read online about using dehumidifier as it might help decrease heating and all that.

If you're heating your house to a comfortable level, then I don't see the benefit in one; the relative humidity indoors will already be quite low.  If you only plan on heating your home slightly, a dehumidifier may help out a bit as the less humid cool air may feel warmer.  Dehumidifiers do put out a bit of heat, which may save you a bit on oil/gas, but will cost you more in electricity.

They're good if you have unheated rooms, and want to keep the dampness away/condensation off walls (definitely make sure to get a desiccant one though).",2023-11-04T16:10:46+00:00

They also have an advantage of being a fairly flexible low-regret type of technology; once you have a heat distribution network in place, you can replace the heat source much more easily than you can refit a lot of individual systems in buildings. We could install them now and supply heat with current technologies, and then later plug them into small modular reactors or whatever other unicorn technology pops up.

Electricity has a similar good property - once you have the network in place you can swap the supply - but refitting the electricity grid to deliver enough power to electrify all heating may well be comparably expensive to putting in heat pipes.",2019-10-15T13:23:52+00:00

Chomsky isn't saying the US is necessarily worse, he's saying it's actions weren't better. The things the USSR did the US condemned were often things the US did, the only difference being the US claimed to do it for good, liberty, democracy, etc. However we know in many cases they happily supported and funded brutal dictators, far-right rebels and in some cases even helped to overthrow/refused to support democratically elected governments that went against their interests. Most of the things the USSR did that I'm sure we'd agree are bad are also things the US did directly or supported.

They did this before WW2, into the Cold War and he predicted would continue to do so under the guise of a new threat. This possibly looks like the case with the US stance towards many Arab and Muslim countries. It's important to note though, that like with the USSR, Chomsky is not saying (like a lot of annoying lefties) anything the US attacks is an innocent victim.

I think you're arguing against an argument I've heard a lot of leftwing people make, which is bad, sometimes veering into supporting anything the US is against (like some commies genuinely think NK is great) but if you read this book you might be surprised. It's not trying to argue the US is really the worst, or everyone the US was against were innocent victims or anything like that.

>Pretending that you cannot make any moral judgement on a governments actions because every government has committed horrible crimes is ridiculous and puts you in the company of modern day Nazi apologists. 

I'm not saying that and neither is Chomsky. It's more saying that by trying to just wrap the whole argument up as ""well I think the US is the lesser of two evils and that is that"" is a massive oversimplification because it glosses over that even if that is true to reach that conclusion we aren't really weighing up communism vs democracy or good vs bad but are weighing up the death, destruction, oppression, torture, etc used by both superpowers and the countries they supported. 

The reason I originally posted this is because I think people fundamentally misunderstand why a lot of leftwing people who *are* familiar with history, don't love the USSR and generally make rational arguments still do not feel allying with the US is a good thing or obviously acceptable price vs allying with the USSR against the Nazis against their war of annihilation. 

I think, as we are you, you can discuss it endlessly. But I don't think it's right when people try to just make out the US and NATO are good and the people they are against are bad, applying different standards of judgement to the crimes of each. There is no way you can support a lot of what the US did and has done, even as the lesser of two evils, while condemning the USSR are clearly more evil than the US without being hypocritical. Because you mention WW2, but I think you are too focused on the theoretical and ideological differences, a big factor in condemning the Nazis, the USSR and the US for their varying types of crimes is not the theory but the actuality of what they did. In the case of the US and USSR if we put everything else aside and just look at the bad things their governments did then neither were countries I'd ever want to ally with *except* out of military necessity. 

Although I'm not sure you get where I'm coming from you are definitely trying to understand the argument even though you don't agree with me which is massively appreciated. Thankyou!

>Bomber Harris may have been a bastard but that doesn’t make Nazi Germany and the British Empire the same.

I actually think Dresden was a legitimate military target and in the context of WW2 was not a war crime. But that's a whole new discussion! In the context of this I think the whole point of the Cold War is that the two competing superpowers basically screwed other people over when neither was really fighting for it's existence, only to extend their power.

LabourUK,post,natural,ls8fb7,MMSTINGRAY,Ralph Miliband & Marcel Liebman- Beyond Social Democracy,"In this essay, we seek to answer two closely related  questions: first, why socialists in advanced capitalist countries should  want to move beyond social democracy; and secondly, what are the  requirements and implications of such a move. Until not so long ago, the  first of these questions would have seemed rather indecent: *of course*  all serious socialists wanted to move beyond social democracy. Today,  no such intention or desire can be taken for granted. For even where  there is sharp criticism of the limitations and derelictions of social  democracy, there is also an implicit acceptance of it, based upon a  despairing uncertainty about what *else* is possible. So both questions do need to be probed.

An answer to the first of them – why socialists should want to move  beyond social democracy – requires a brief recapitulation of its nature  and record. An initial distinction needs to be made for this purpose  between social democracy before 1914, and social democracy after World  War I and particularly since 1945. In its earlier formative phase,  social democracy unambiguously stood for the wholesale transformation of  the social order, from capitalism to socialism, on the basis of the  social appropriation of the main means of production, distribution and  exchange, a far reaching democratisation of the political system, and a  drastic levelling out of social inequality. This was to be achieved by  way of a long series of economic, social and political reforms, to be  brought about by way of a parliamentary majority reflecting a  preponderance of electoral and popular support. There were many  differences between socialists as to the precise nature of the reforms  to be realised, and the strategy to be employed in their advancement and  there were also revolutionary socialists in the ranks of social  democracy, of whom Rosa Luxemburg was the most notable representative,  who proposed a strategy of mass struggle far removed from the  electoralism and parliamentarism of the predominant current. Still,  ‘reformists’ could still very plausibly argue that they too were fully  committed to the socialist project. As Jean Jaurès once said about the  French Socialist Party, ‘precisely because it is a party of revolution  ... the Socialist Party is the most actively reformist’. [\[1\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/miliband/1985/xx/beyondsd.htm#n1)

What gave ‘reformism’ its pejorative connotations and made it all but  synonymous with class collaboration and betrayal was not its reliance  on gradual reforms as a path to socialist transformation, but the  support for the war by the leaders of the Second International in August  1914 (and after) and their fierce opposition to left internationalists,  of whom Lenin was of course the most conspicuous figure. With the  triumph of the Bolsheviks in Russia in October 1917, Lenin’s strictures  against the ‘reformist traitors’ acquired a unique global authority and  resonance. This has greatly affected the debate on the Left on the  question of what strategy is most likely to advance matters, in  socialist terms, in advanced capitalist countries with  capitalist-democratic regimes. The debate has in fact often been  conducted by the revolutionary Left in rather simplistic terms: on the  one hand, reformism equals socialist betrayal; on the other, revolution  equals socialist rectitude. But the questions that need to be raised in  regard to the appropriate socialist strategy for these countries cannot  be resolved in these terms. [\[2\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/miliband/1985/xx/beyondsd.htm#n2)

More will be said about this later, but the point that needs to be  made here is that so far as social democracy after 1914 is concerned,  the ‘reformist’ label has been of ever-decreasing relevance to its  actual purposes, and is in fact quite misleading. For the purpose of  social democracy, as expressed in practice by labour movements and  parties everywhere since World War I has not been a ‘reformist’  socialist project in the classical sense at all. From that time onwards,  and more and more definitely, it has in essence been a project of  moderate reform within the framework of capitalism, a striving, at best,  to achieve a better deal for organised labour and the ‘lower income  groups’ inside capitalist society; and this has been linked to the wish  to see the state make a more effective contribution to the management of  capitalism. Social democracy became more and more attuned to the  requirements of capitalism; and where these requirements clashed with  reform, it was reform that was more often than not sacrificed on the  altar of the ‘national interest’, ‘pragmatism’ and ‘realism’, or  whatever else might serve to cover up compromise and retreat. The  ‘reformist’, transformative project has remained part of the occasional  rhetoric of social democratic leaders, to be brought out on suitable  occasions such as party conferences; but the rhetoric has been  consistently belied by the actual practice of social democracy. The most  it has ever striven to achieve is capitalism with a more human face:  the record is consistent across time and countries and continents – from  Attlee to Wilson and Callaghan in Britain, from Leon Blum to Guy Mollet  to Mitterrand in France, from Ebert to Brandt to Schmidt in Germany,  etc.

Certainly, it would be quite wrong to ignore or undervalue the  reforms which social democracy has helped to achieve in capitalist  societies over the years, or the important role which its presence and  pressure have played in forcing issues and policies on the political  agenda which otherwise would have been ignored or differently handled.  But acknowledging this and giving it its full weight should not obscure  the deeply negative aspects of the record.

For one thing, social democracy has consistently sought to *limit*  the scope and substance of the reforms which it has itself proposed and  implemented, in an endeavour to pacify and accommodate capitalist  forces, and to demonstrate how much these forces could count on the  ‘moderation’ and ‘reasonableness’ of their social democratic opponents;  and also because social democratic leaders in office have always readily  endorsed conservative economic policies and submitted equally readily  to the constraints this has imposed upon them. As a result, social  democratic reforms, however useful, have tended to have a limited  character and impact, and have been very vulnerable to conservative  attack. Even when circumstances were most favourable, for instance in  the years after World War II in such countries as Britain and France,  when popular readiness and support for radical change was very high, it  was timidity rather than boldness, submission to convention rather than  innovative zeal which characterised social democratic reforming  measures.

Secondly, social democracy has generally been deeply concerned to  narrow the scope of political activity, to confine it as far as possible  to carefully controlled party and parliamentary channels, to restrict  and stifle grassroots activism except in the service of the party’s  electoral interests. Much of the energy of social democratic leaders has  been devoted to the containment and channelling of the energies of  their rank and file, and to the control of that rank and file by the  party apparatus; and much the same concern has been evident among trade  union leaders as well.

Thirdly and relatedly, social democratic leaders have always reserved  their most energetic attacks for left activists in the labour movement.  Social democratic hostility to the Left was already fierce and  pervasive long before the Bolshevik Revolution and the coming into being  of Communist parties. But the establishment of Soviet Russia and of  Communist parties gave a new dynamic and legitimation to the struggle  against anyone who demanded more radical policies and actions than  social democratic leaders were themselves prepared to endorse, and  provided these leaders with a convenient bogey to use against their  opponents on the left, whatever their particular brand of socialism  might be. Social democratic leaders, in parties and trade unions thus  turned themselves into very effective watchdogs against the spread of  socialist ideas and influence in the labour movement: no conservative  politician could hope to have anything like the same impact in this  respect. The effect of these endeavours has been of immense importance  in the history of labour movements everywhere.

Fourthly, social democratic opposition to anything to the left of  social democracy played a major role after 1945 in mobilising labour  movements, or those parts of labour movements under their control,  behind the global counter-revolutionary crusade which capitalist  governments have been waging since World War II under the leadership of  the United States. Again and again, it is the social democratic leaders  of Western European labour movements who have proved the most faithful  and dedicated supporters and allies of the United States in this global  enterprise, with the excuse that what was at stake was the defence of  the West, freedom, democracy and the rest, against the dire threat of  Soviet expansionism and aggression.

It would have been perfectly possible for social democratic leaders  to oppose the installation after World War II of Soviet-type regimes on  countries contiguous to the Soviet Union without lending their authority  to what has undoubtedly been one of the great myths of the second half  of the twentieth century, namely the myth of Soviet expansionism. [\[3\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/miliband/1985/xx/beyondsd.htm#n3)  Social democratic leaders did not choose that option, and thus made a  major contribution to the granting of respectability to that myth. In  the same context, these same leaders played a major part in supporting  and defending the defence policies of the United States, notwithstanding  the fact that these policies have been dominated by American  determination to maintain a preponderance in nuclear weaponry: at no  point have social democratic leaders made a serious contribution to the  curbing of the arms race.

Finally, social democracy played a notable – and utterly  dishonourable – role in the post-war decades in waging war, or in  supporting the waging of war, against independence movements in the  colonial territories of their countries. French social democracy was at  the very centre of the murderous struggle waged against the independence  movements in Indochina and Algeria, with names like Robert Lacoste and  Guy Mollet forever inscribed in annals of shame and British social  democracy was similarly involved in the struggles of the 1940s and 1950s  in British colonial territories – in Malaya and Kenya, in Cyprus and  Aden. Nowhere and at no time in those years did social democratic  leaders anywhere in imperialist countries show any sign that they took  the notion of socialist internationalism seriously.

In short, the record shows quite conclusively that social democracy  has never posed any real threat to the structure of domination and  exploitation of capitalist societies. Throughout, its leaders have  clearly demonstrated that they have been concerned with the management  of capitalism, not its supercession; and in the field of defence and  foreign affairs, they have always been much more the colleagues of  conservative politicians than their opponents. *In practice*,  there has existed a very high degree of consensus on the broad lines of  policy, based upon the acceptance by social democratic leaders of the  policies of conservative governments: occasional disagreements on  specific issues, however sharp, have not fundamentally disturbed this  consensus. The point is particularly applicable to defence and foreign  policy; but it is hardly less relevant in other fields as well.

There have always been many socialists in the ranks of social  democratic parties who have opposed their leaders and sought to push  them and their parties in more radical directions. They have on occasion  had some successes, and their efforts have no doubt also prevented  their leaders from moving even further in the direction of compromise  and retreat. However, it must be noted that this socialist opposition  inside social democratic parties has never managed to ‘capture’ these  parties for the Left and given them a decisively different orientation  and sets of programmes and policies. Social democratic leaders of the  Centre and the Right have remained in command of their parties, and have  continued to determine their policies and actions, notwithstanding the  concessions they have occasionally had to make to their critics.

Nor does there seem to be any very good reason for thinking that  matters are likely to be very different in the future. It is of course  possible – indeed likely – that socialists will continue to extract  occasional concessions from their leaders, in programmatic and even in  practical terms; and it is equally possible that the pressure of events  will compel these leaders to adopt different policies, even somewhat  more radical ones – that they will, for instance be compelled to take a  greater distance from American defence and foreign policies and seek to  act as a more ‘restraining’ influence on the United States than has been  the case in the past. To a limited extent, some such shift in these  areas has already occurred in the years of the Reagan Presidency.

Anything of this sort must of course be welcome from a socialist  point of view. But it should on no account obscure the fact that any  such variation in programme or action occurs within a social democratic  framework which is very set and solid. What socialists confront here –  or ought to confront – is an ideological, political, even psychological,  construct of great strength, which is open, flexible, loose on its  right, but which is very unwilling, even unable, to yield much on its  left. In other words, social democratic leaders find it much easier to  compromise and consort with their conservative adversaries on the right  than with their socialist critics on the left.

In seeking to explain the reasons for their opposition to the  policies advocated by the Left, social democratic leaders themselves  have often advanced the view that whatever the merits of these policies  might be, extreme caution must be exercised in proposing anything which  ‘the electorate’ could find ‘extreme’ and therefore unacceptable. On  this view, the reluctance of social democratic leaders to endorse, let  alone initiate, radical policies, is not due to their own predilections,  but to their realism, and to their understanding of the fact that to  move too far ahead of ‘public opinion’ and advocate policies for which  ‘the public’ is not ready is to court electoral disaster and political  paralysis.

This raises some very large and important points. It is undoubtedly  true that ‘the electorate’ in the capitalist-democratic regimes of  advanced capitalist countries does not support parties which advocate,  or which appear to stand for, the revolutionary overthrow of the  political system; and ‘the electorate’ here includes the overwhelming  mass of the working class as well as other classes. This rejection by  the working class and ‘lower income groups’ in general of parties  committed or seemingly committed to the overthrow of the political and  social order is a fact of major political importance, to say the least.

However, this does not at all mean that organised labour, the working  class and the subordinate population of advanced capitalist countries  (which constitutes the vast majority of their population) is also  opposed to far-reaching changes and radical reforms. Social democratic  parties have themselves been driven on many occasions to proclaim their  transformative ambitions in their electoral manifestos, and to speak of  their firm determination to create ‘a new social order’; and have  nevertheless scored remarkable electoral victories with such programmes.  Popular commitment to radical transformative purposes may not,  generally speaking, be very deep; but there has at any rate been very  little evidence of popular revulsion from such purposes.

The notion that very large parts of ‘the electorate’, and notably the  working class, is bound to reject radical programmes is a convenient  alibi, but little else. The real point, which is crucial, is that such  programmes and policies need to be defended and propagated with the  utmost determination and vigour by leaders totally convinced of the  justice of their cause. It is *this* which is always lacking:  infirmity of purpose and the fear of radical measures lies not with the  working class but with the social democratic leaders themselves.

The same point must be made about social democratic governments. Such  governments have never been disavowed by the working class because they  were too ‘extreme’ or radical or over-zealous in pressing forward with  reform: on the contrary, they have been disavowed precisely because they  have regularly retreated from the promises enshrined in their  manifestos, because they have adopted policies that ran counter to these  promises, because they disillusioned and demoralised their supporters,  and because they gave every indication that there was little to expect  from their continuance in office. It is in this connection very odd that  the lamentations which are so often heard on the Left about the decline  of working class support for social democratic parties do not take  greater account of the record of social democratic governments: the  wonder is not the decline, but the resilience of support which, despite  everything, endures for such parties in the working class and beyond.

It is also an important part of the picture that social democratic  retreats and derelictions have disastrous repercussions on the labour  movement. As social democratic governments retreat, so division and  strife inside social democratic parties grow. The Left protests and  attacks the leadership and seeks to deflect it from its courses; and the  leadership turns on the Left and accuses it of disloyalty. Conservative  forces rejoice; and the working class, or a large part of it, remains  alienated or is further alienated from a divided and warring party.

We are therefore driven back to the leadership of social democratic  parties. Again and again, social democratic governments have been  elected with substantial, sometimes sweeping, parliamentary and popular  majorities, on programmes of extensive reform and renewal, in a climate  of genuine enthusiasm and support, and have very soon flagged and  dissipated that enthusiasm and support, and retreated into the positions  and policies just described.

It is of course true that even very ‘moderate’ and compromising  social democratic governments confront very serious economic and  financial constraints; that such governments operate in a generally  unsympathetic or frankly hostile administrative context, in which other  parts of the state tend to view social democratic ministers as  interlopers; that they are subject to constant and often virulent  attacks from an overwhelmingly conservative press; and that all  conservative forces want to see the ‘experiment’ brought to an end as  soon as possible, and do what they can to hasten the day.

All this must indeed be taken into account. It is perfectly  reasonable – indeed essential – to appreciate the determination of this  opposition even to social democracy. The point, however, is that most  social democratic politicians are very ill-adapted to the politics of  confrontation and struggle, at least with their conservative opponents –  it is otherwise with their own activists on the Left.

This is not a matter of character but of ideological dispositions.  Those who get to leadership positions in social democratic parties are  generally ‘safe’ people, who can be relied on to pursue ‘moderate’,  ‘reasonable’, ‘sensible’ courses. A process of co-optation, sifting and  selection is at work on the way up, so that people who are deemed to be  ideologically and politically ‘unsound’ can be kept at arm’s length, and  pushed back to the periphery of the party. The apparatus itself is  under the control of ‘moderate’ men and women, and is used quite  ruthlessly to ensure that the right people are brought in and the wrong  people kept out. Where left socialists do nevertheless break through and  cannot easily or safely be prevented from obtaining ministerial office,  they are at least kept out of strategic offices such as finance, home  affairs, foreign affairs and defence.

For most social democratic politicians, capitalist society (in so far  as the existence of capitalism is acknowledged at all) is not a  battlefield on which opposed classes are engaged in a permanent  conflict, now more acute, now less, and in which they are firmly on one  side, but a community, no doubt quarrelsome, but a community  nonetheless, in which various groups – be they employers, workers,  public employees, etc. – make selfish and damaging demands, which it is  the task of government to resist for the good of all; and it is a  community in which help must naturally be extended to the weakest  members. On this view, what is required of government, and what a social  democratic government is peculiarly well able to provide, is good will,  understanding, fairness, compassion, so that specific problems may be  tackled and resolved; and it also follows that social democratic  leaders, in practice as distinct from rhetoric or even sentiment, are by  no means separated from their conservative opponents by an unbridgeable  gulf. On the contrary, there are many channels of communication,  understanding and even agreement between them. The business of social  democratic leaders is conciliation and compromise. Their concern may be  to advance reform, but also to contain the pressure for it. Gramsci  spoke of intellectuals as ‘managers of consent’: the formulation is even  more applicable to social democratic politicians. As such, they play a  major role in the stabilisation of the politics of capitalist-democratic  societies.

Given this, it is easy to understand why social democratic  politicians, with the partial exception of Salvador Allende in Chile,  have never sought to probe the limits of ‘reformism’, and have always  retreated long before they faced a serious confrontation with  conservative forces. To have done so would have required them to assume  the leadership of a mass movement from which their whole view of the  world led them to recoil. It is simply not realistic to expect such  people to provide the inspiration and the leadership required to bring  about a transformation of capitalist society in socialist directions:  the task demands, at the very least, a set of ideological commitments  which they do not possess.

What then, in socialist terms, is there beyond social democracy?

There have over the years been a good many different answers to this  question. One of the main ones, of Leninist inspiration, proposes the  building and nurturing of a ‘vanguard’ party, tightly organised on  ‘democratic centralist’ lines, involved in a daily class struggle at the  point of production and at all other points of tension in capitalist  society, with the expectation that capitalist crisis must ultimately  reach a point at which it will become unmanageable, as a result of which  it will no longer be possible to contain popular anger within the  confines of the political system. At that point, a revolutionary  situation will have come to exist, which will make it possible for the  ‘vanguard’ party to seize the moment and lead the working class towards a  seizure of power. The bourgeois state will be smashed, and replaced by a  dictatorship of the proletariat, on the basis of proletarian power,  workers’ councils and other authentically democratic forms.

Those who propose this strategy are well aware that in no advanced  capitalist country has this ‘scenario’ come anywhere near to being  realised. But they are of course able to argue that the realisation of  the ‘scenario’ is only a matter of time, that the crisis is not yet far  enough advanced but is developing, that the working class is still in  the grip of social democratic ‘reformist’ illusions, but that it is  bound to acquire greater class consciousness under the impact of events,  and so forth. Some such beliefs have for many years – in fact since  1917 – sustained a core of dedicated militants and revolutionaries in  all advanced capitalist countries, and indeed in all other countries as  well.

However, it needs to be said, that this revolutionary ‘scenario’ even  with a marked aggravation of capitalist crisis, is very unlikely to be  realised in advanced capitalist countries. If or when a revolutionary  situation does arise in one or other such country, the chances are that  it will play itself out very differently from what is envisaged in this  ‘scenario’.

This, however, is speculation of a fairly futile kind. For a very  long time to come, what socialists will confront is crisis and conflict,  but quite emphatically not a revolutionary situation; and all  experience very strongly suggests that parties and groupings which base  their intervention in political life on the lines just indicated,  condemn themselves to marginality and ineffectiveness. Their problem is  not that they are unable to attract any serious measure of popular  support: the real problem is that they have generally proved unable to  attract any serious measure of activist and socialist support.

There are a number of reasons for this. One of them is that the  notion of a tightly-organised, democratic-centralist organisation has  proved to be a very good recipe for top-down and manipulative  leadership, for undemocratic centralism and the stifling of genuine  debate, sharp divisions and resort to expulsions, and a turnover of  members so high as to make the organisation a transit camp from  innocence and enthusiasm to disillusionment and bitterness. Only the  leadership remains permanently entrenched, presiding year after year  over a constantly renewed membership, and virtually irremovable save by  internal upheavals, splits and excommunications. Parties and groupings  such as this have shown very little capacity to think through the  problems which the socialist project presents, and have tended instead  to resort to incantation and sloganeering as a substitute. They have  often included some very talented individuals, who have made important  contributions to socialist thinking. But the groupings themselves have  generated remarkably little that was fresh and innovative: the ardour  and dedication of their members have more often than not been doomed to  ineffectiveness because of the shortcomings of the organisations of  which they were members and the distrust which these shortcomings  engendered among socialist activists in the labour movement whom they  needed to attract.

Secondly, the very notion of a ‘vanguard’ party has acquired an  arrogant and ‘imperialistic’ ring, quite unacceptable in labour  movements with a long history and with many different and contradictory  or at least disparate tendencies. Vanguard parties are by definition  unique and dominant: there cannot be two or more such parties. But it is  only by compulsion and coercion that one party can impose itself as the  ‘vanguard’ or leading’ party. In the circumstances of advanced  capitalist societies, with a high density of different organisations,  interests, purposes, tendencies and aspirations, a socialist party can  only expect to be one element in a comradely alliance between different  formations. It may hope, by virtue of its conduct, clear sightedness and  support, to become a major reference point in that alliance, even a  senior partner in it, but without any pretension to an arbitrary and  stifling predominance.

This is not only a matter of strategy in struggle. It raises larger  issues concerning the political system appropriate to a socialist  society. All the available evidence suggests that the concept of ‘the  leading party’ (in effect the monopolistic party) tends to produce  authoritarianism and the suppression of dissent – indeed the construal  of all dissent as counter-revolutionary and therefore unacceptable.  There are no doubt circumstances of extreme peril where diversity,  pluralism, and conflicting tendencies are very difficult to maintain:  but failure to maintain them should be seen for what it is, namely a  major retreat from socialist principles. What happened to the Bolshevik  Party after the banning of ‘factions’ at the Xth Party Congress in 1921  offers an instructive lesson of what such banning entails for the life  of a revolutionary party.

A further reason for the marginalisation and relative ineffectiveness  of ‘Marxist-Leninist’ revolutionary groupings in advanced capitalist  societies has to do with their failure to take seriously the context of  capitalist democracy in which they operate. These groupings tend to  treat capitalist democracy as a complete sham; and therefore to accord a  wholly subordinate place to electoral struggles, a form of activity for  which they have great contempt. Whereas social democratic parties  suffer from ‘parliamentary cretinism’, they tend to suffer from  something akin to ‘anti-parliamentary cretinism’. The fact is, that  whatever the limitations of capitalist democracy may be – and they are  drastic enough – no party or grouping operating within its context can  afford not to seek some degree of electoral support, not least at local  level. This requires a great deal more than a sudden irruption on the  scene at election time.

What then, has been – and should be – the socialist alternative to  these groupings? It has already been argued here that social democratic  parties cannot realistically be taken to be such an alternative. That  alternative entails a firm revolutionary commitment, namely the  wholesale transformation of capitalist society in socialist directions.  But it also involves a ‘reformist’ commitment, in so far as it also  seeks all reforms which can be seen to form part of the larger  revolutionary purpose.

Such ‘revolutionary reformism’ involves intervention in class  struggle at all points of conflict in society, and pre-eminently at the  site of work. It also involves electoral struggles at all levels and  conceives these struggles as an intrinsic part of class struggle,  without allowing itself to be absorbed into electoralism and  parliamentarism; and it also means the permanent striving to strengthen  the socialist presence on the political scene and in the political  culture.

It should also be said that ‘revolutionary reformism’ does not  postulate a smooth and uneventful transition to socialism by way of  electoral support and parliamentary majorities. It acknowledges that, in  the context of capitalist democracy, such a transition requires a  massive degree of popular support and commitment, one of whose  expressions (but by no means the only or even the most important one) is  electoral strength and parliamentary representation. But ‘revolutionary  reformism’ is also bound to be very conscious of the fact that any  serious challenge to dominant classes must inevitably evoke resistance,  and will be determined to meet that resistance with every weapon that  this requires, including of course the mobilisation of mass support.

In historical terms, the parties which have embodied this  ‘revolutionary reformism’ are the Communist Parties of the advanced  capitalist countries (and others as well for that matter). To say this  may seem paradoxical, since they themselves have always fiercely  rejected the ‘reformist’ label, not surprisingly given the pejorative  connotations it acquired after 1914. But the labelling is nevertheless  wholly justified – it is in fact the ‘revolutionary’ part which may be  the more problematic.

The reason for saying it is justified is that after the first years of *Sturm und Drang*  following the Bolshevik Revolution and the foundation of these parties,  it came to be understood that the overthrow of capitalism was not on  the agenda; and Communist parties installed themselves as best they  could (and in so far as bourgeois governments allowed them to do so) in  the political life of their countries, and became in fact if not in name  ‘reformist’ parties with an ultimately revolutionary vocation, a strong  engagement in class struggle, taking part in electoral contests, and  pressing for immediate as well as long term gains and reforms. There  were periods when twists in Comintern policy (for instance the ‘third  period’, ‘class against class’, social democrats are ‘social fascists’  phase between 1929 and 1934) or the twists in Soviet foreign policy (the  ‘imperialist war’ phase between 1939 and 1941) forced the parties back  into a more ‘revolutionary’ position. But this represented the exception  rather than the rule, and that position has not on the whole been taken  up since 1945.

What was fundamentally wrong with these Communist parties was two  things: first, their total subservience to Stalin’s policies and  purposes; and secondly, closely related to this, their mode of  organisation. Enough has been said and written about the Stalinism of  Communist parties between the late twenties and the early fifties to  take this as given here: for present purposes, it is enough to note the  degree to which the combination of sectarianism and opportunism which  characterised Stalinism, together with sudden changes of policy imposed  from Moscow, blighted their politics and blunted their political  effectiveness.

As for their mode of organisation, the ‘democratic centralism’ to  which they subscribed, and which the nature of Stalinism made imperative  (how else could total obedience be imposed?), helped to foster all the  vices which have been discussed earlier, and which turned these parties  into profoundly undemocratic institutions, in which ‘deviation’ was  impermissible, and in which the word of the leadership was law, whatever  that word might be, and however much the word of the moment  contradicted the word that had gone before. Attempts might be made to  provide the leaders with a simulacrum of democratic legitimation by the  holding of Party Congresses. But these were manipulated and stunted  affairs, which gave no real power or influence to ‘ordinary’ members.

Unquestioning subservience to the Soviet Union by Communist parties  has generally speaking given way to a more flexible stance, though  parties differ in the degree to which they allow themselves freedom to  criticise Soviet policies and actions. On the other hand, ‘democratic  centralism’ endures as a principle of organisation, and ensures the  perpetuation of the stultifying practices of the past. Old habits die  hard, particularly when they are so convenient to a leadership thus  rendered irremovable by the party membership.

These are crippling weaknesses; and there is also much else in the  mode of operation, the policies and positions of Communist parties which  warrants severe criticism. But they are much less vulnerable to the  charge which is usually levelled against them by their  ‘Marxist-Leninist’ opponents on the Left, namely their ‘reformism’. For  there is a profound, fundamental sense in which revolutionary parties,  in the context of capitalist democracy, do need to engage in a politics  which it is very glib to denounce as ‘reformist’, and therefore as  beyond the pale.

The real question is what kind of ‘reformism’ parties which affirm a  revolutionary vocation actually do engage in. At one end, there is the  ‘revolutionary reformism’ which was discussed earlier. At the other,  there is a ‘reformism’ constituted by a practice which tends  increasingly towards social democracy and is increasingly oblivious to  the larger transformative purposes in which reforms are or ought to be  inscribed, which comes to be dominated by electoral calculations to the  detriment of principle, is more concerned with the control of class  struggle than with its encouragement, and allows policy to be chopped  and changed according to the opportunistic manoeuvres of party leaders.  The French Communist Party provides a very good example of this kind of  ‘reformism’. The Italian Communist Party, on the other hand, mirrors  well the struggle between the two kinds of ‘reformism’.

If it is the case, as has been argued here, that ‘revolutionary  reformism’ (or whatever else the position encompassed by the formula may  be called) does represent an alternative to social democracy, and  points in realistic fashion beyond it, the very large question which  this poses is what agencies are to push this forward. The argument so  far developed is clearly intended to suggest that social democracy does  not offer any reasonable hope of turning itself into such an agency;  that Communist parties carry burdens from the past which make it very  difficult for them to undergo the process of transformation which is  required for the purpose; and that ‘Marxist-Leninist’ groupings to the  left of Communist parties operate in far too narrow an ideological and  political framework to make it possible for them to turn themselves from  small sects into substantial parties.

How this situation will be resolved is not clear, and will in any  case be resolved differently in different countries. In some, Communist  parties may come to shed their negative features and form the basis for a  socialist realignment on the Left in others, that realignment will have  to come from other left sources. However it comes to pass, the process  is likely to be protracted: serious socialist parties cannot suddenly be  conjured up out of nothing.

Be that as it may, the point is that the socialist cause *needs*  political articulation, and that this political articulation, though  not exclusively provided by parties, does nevertheless require the  agency of party. However useful and effective other elements of pressure  in the political system may be – trade unions, movements of women,  blacks, ecologists, peace activists and many others – they cannot and do  not for the most part wish to fulfil the main task of socialist  parties, which is to inject a ‘stream of socialist tendency’, by word  and action, into the political system and culture of their societies.  Such parties are of course concerned with immediate issues, grievances  and demands but they are also, beyond this, concerned with the effective  dissolution of the structures of power of capitalist society and their  replacement by a fundamentally different social order, based upon the  social ownership and control of the main means of economic activity, and  governed by principles of co-operation, civic freedom, egalitarianism,  and democratic arrangements far superior to the narrowly class-bound  arrangements of capitalist democracy.

Many parties of the Left have advocated these principles over the  years. For reasons given earlier, they have also suffered from great  weaknesses, which reduced or nullified their effectiveness. The sooner  these weaknesses are faced, and overcome, the better will become the  prospects of socialist advance.",2021-02-25T15:00:44+00:00

No, much better to focus on nice, benign environmental energy sources which only give us just enough energy to fulfil our basic needs but no more than that; it softly limits what humanity can do, and that is, supposedly, a good thing.

That means it takes ages to negotiate stuff like contracts and strike prices etc and we ultimately end up paying over the odds in order to de-risk these projects to guarantee profit for private companies. And sometimes (like with Wylfa and Moorside nuclear power stations) they just pull out anyway. 

Ultimately it means only the profitable and easy projects get built. 

But if the project is built by a government owned entity it doesn't have to make a profit (and if it does make a profit, that money goes back to the Exchequer), planning is easier, you have more control of where and when these projects are built, and theoretically they can be built quicker as well.

europe,post,planet,2lex9o,DetlefKroeze,With Philae just days away from landing on 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko I thought I'd give an overview of what else ESA has in the pipeline.,"ESA's divides [its missions](http://sci.esa.int/cosmic-vision/) into Large, Medium and Small, although some fall outside of this categorization. Also I'm not going into the earth observation and climate missions ESA has planned, for the simple reason that I don't know much about those.

The [Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Icy_Moon_Explorer) or JUICE (L1), which is scheduled to launch in 2022, will by a Ganymede orbiter. It will arrive at the Jovian system in 2030 and after a few years cruising around studying the other moons will enter orbit around Ganymede in 2033. More details can be found [here (PDF)](http://sci2.esa.int/cosmic-vision/JUICE_Yellow_Book_Issue1.pdf)

The second L-Class mission is ATHENA, short for [Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Telescope_for_High_Energy_Astrophysics), will be an X-Ray telescope. It is schedule to launch in 2028. More information can be found [here (PDF)](http://sci2.esa.int/cosmic-vision/AthenaYB_v4-2_final.pdf)

The third L-Class mission, which has yet to be announced, will launch in 2034. The theme for L3 is the gravitational universe and [LISA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Interferometer_Space_Antenna) is the main contender for that mission. More info [can be found in this PDF.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xterufgddbcuglo/LISA_YellowBook_ESA-SRE-2011-3_Feb2011.pdf?dl=0)

There are currently three M-Class missions in the work, and another one is expected to be announced next March.

The first one is [Solar Orbiter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Orbiter), which will  launch in 2018. No points for guessing what it will study. As before, here is a PDF with [more information.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xterufgddbcuglo/LISA_YellowBook_ESA-SRE-2011-3_Feb2011.pdf?dl=0)

M2 will be [Euclid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid_%28spacecraft%29), a space telescope that will map the geometry of the dark Universe. Launch is scheduled for 2020.  More info can be found [here (PDF)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lmjud2le5hpdnj3/EUCLID_RB_Issue_1-1_2011-09-29HighQ.pdf?dl=0)

Planetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO), the third M-Class mission, is another space observatory. PLATO's mission is to find and study a large number of extrasolar planetary systems, with emphasis on the properties of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around solar-like stars. Launch is scheduled for 2024. More information can be found [here (PDF)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tbyigwh2bm068dk/ESA_SRE_2013_5_PLATO.pdf?dl=0)

The only Small mission announced so far is [CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHEOPS), a small space telescope dedicated to searching for exoplanetary transits by performing ultra-high precision photometry on bright stars already known to host planets. Here is the PDF with [more information.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lvhpie14psfa8t0/CHEOPS_EST_SCI_RP_001_RedBook_i1.0.pdf?dl=0)

Falling outside of the Large, Medium, Small categorization are ExoMars, consisting of the [Trace Gas Orbiter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExoMars_Trace_Gas_Orbiter) and the Schiaparelli EDM lander (basically a technology demonstrator) to be launched just over over a year from now in January of 2016, and the [ExoMars rover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExoMars_rover) to be launched in 2018, altough it might be delayed to 2020. The joint ESA/JAXA BepiColombo mission to Mercury also falls outside of the LMS categorization. Launch of [BepiColombo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BepiColombo) is currently scheduled for 2016 but is has been delayed before so don't hold your breath. I actually saw it when I visited ESTEC a couple of years ago, so it is one of my personal favourites. Sadly, I couldn't find any of the detailed pdf's I posted for the earlier missions.

In other countries in Europe Sushi are less expensive and way better than what we have over here.

It seems like there's only the cheap sushi and the high-end sushi restaurants but nothing in between.

Also few restaurants offer nigiri options and when they do it is really getting expensive. Don't British like nigiri too ?

In France for example we got a Sushi chain called Planet Sushi. They offer large range of sushi options and the price is pretty descent. All sushi are served with steamed rice on the side/soup for about 15€ (about 13 pounds). The quality is great.

Why can't we have that in the UK ? Why are Sushi restaurants ripping us off ?

Scotland,comment,pollution,dbq8aw9,CyberGnat,,"More practically, you're unlikely to be allowed or able to drive manually in towns and cities once the technology becomes properly widespread. For instance, when self-driving cars exist the business need for car parks more or less evaporates. Big surface car parks are currently tolerated by the market because without them, nearby shops and businesses wouldn't be able to function. If that's no longer necessary, then the land will be used for more productive purposes instead. Similarly, the councils will be able to remove all on-street parking and make space available instead for public transport or more likely cyclists and pedestrians. Self-driving vehicles can drive with centimetre precision so roads wouldn't have to be as wide either.

Beyond that, self-driving cars are absolutely essential to make the most of the road network. Self-driving vehicles can all accelerate and stop simultaneously, so you need far less space to move the same number of vehicles. Junctions can be made free-flowing by weaving cars in and out with perfect precision, so journey times would decrease. It's an interesting fact that the average travel speed in cities hasn't changed at all with the transition from horse and cart to self-powered vehicles, as in cities the main limit on speed and throughput is the terrible human driver rather than the inherent qualities of the vehicle.",2016-12-28T20:21:45+00:00

\- People don't know how to recycle and admittedly we do make it hard sometimes (you have to make sure its the right type of plastic - squint at the little numbers).

\- People have a heap ton of things to worry about than putting the right thing in the right bin.

\- People don't care/disenfranchised by the whole idea (someone else's problem).

\- People 'wishcycle' or think they are helping by putting everything that's made out of plastic or items with multiple components.

\- Bin crews cant/don't want to check every single bin.  
\- Manufacturers putting out items on the market that blatantly cant be recycled using current methods - anybody notice black plastic isn't a thing anymore for microwaveable meals ?

  
\- News reports about waste going overseas and people rightly asking the question - where does our waste go? in this regard we need to be a bit more transparent (like wales) - the recycled materials market is global. If you're interested - ask them!! 

  
\- If done right, all the recyclable materials do have value (check out how much a tonne of HDPE is worth or a tonne aluminium cans). inevitably the authority do have to deal with contamination and its frustrating because its 100% preventable one way or another.

\- Regardless of where the waste is deposited the Local council has to deal with it.

Just as an aside - not many Local authorities use landfill anymore - most residual waste/contamination is used as a fuel in electricity from waste facilities. There are no real targets anymore - in Wales councils get fined for not meeting targets but over here we don't, so there isn't any real incentive (other than savings) to roll out new services.

So it's very easy to argue that shipping emissions are grossly underestimated but incredibly difficult to know by how much.

Currently shipping emissions are estimated based on fuel per cargo per mile.

Left out of that equation is the mining of steel to build the ships (200,000 tonnes per ship), building a dry dock to build a ship, building a ship, maintaining a ship, building a port & machinery to dock and unload a ship, running and maintaining a port to dock & unload a ship (all runs on diesel), tugs to guide ships out to sea, digging and dredging shipping channels, harbour defences, canals, scrapping a ship and the chance of wreckages.

Not to mention the impact the fuel used by cargo ships has on not just the climate but also the environment. It's the cheapest least refined most toxic slurry. It's so harmful they can only use it in international waters because it fails to meet most countries emissions standards.

Shipping ruins coastlines, pollutes the seas and kills marine wildlife.

Admittedly the proportion attributed to one tin of chickpeas is very small, but the associated fuel costs could easily double or triple what is currently estimated. Factor in environmental harm and a steak pales in comparison.

I'll give you the first one due to my poor choice of words. What I meant to convey was, without hydro the partial ""recovery"" of the Highlands wouldn't the same as it is now. I used ""recovered"" not as an absolute but as a description of stage. 

I am not learned enough to go into the minutiae of the clearances but there are many places that wouldn't be what they are now had it not been for hydro. 
I'm talking retrospectively regarding grid connections during the late 40's to the 60's. You think the Isle of Iona would be have a mainland connection these days at a reasonable cost? The villages of Cannich, Foyers or even Lairg would have regained what thay had before. Fort William another one, it's the only aluminium works that wasn't shut by GFG Alliance because it was the only non fossil fuel plant in the UK and that is thanks to 1920s construction in 2020. 

Hydro has been built in the modern age, Glendoe for example, it was at one point the largest engineering project in Western Europe and was opened in 2009. However I'm not debating the vicissitudes of modern day hydro. 

In YOUR opinion, if we weren't for hydro what position would the Highlands collectively be in? 

I do indeed agree with you, the investment was made for the whole country to benefit from the Highlands and not for the people of the Highlands. 

Now, I'm not going to make a prejudiced remark about where you may or may not be from but did you grow up in a house or community that existed as a direct result of a hydro scheme in the Highlands? I did.",2021-08-01T23:59:07+00:00

>You just know GB Energy is going to be the most useless 'scam' ever. Something on paper before an election that sounds good but ends up being utterly unworkable and substandard when none of the deep rooted fundamentals change around energy ownership.

It's already bullshit. There is the obvious socialist arguments, but even without that it's really fucking stupid.

>

>A few days ago, the Times published a piece by Patrick Maguire which said what a lot of Labour-watchers had been thinking: the party has suddenly gone very quiet on its £28 billion green investment pledge.

>Speaking in Washington last week, Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves discussed Labour’s green prosperity plan and so-called ‘securonomics’. On the same trip, she “did not deny that the £28 billion is still, despite its exalted place in Labour’s thinking, liable to be cut under her own fiscal rules, which stipulate that government debt must fall over the lifetime of a Starmer government”.

>As a general election looms, the party seems to be feeling more keenly the pressure to avoid being tarred by political opponents as the party of massive borrowing.

>The tension over the £28 billion pledge has been brewing for some time, but the same is not (yet) true for Labour’s other major energy policy announcement – a publicly owned energy company.

>Indeed, Sir Keir Starmer has a lot of reasons to be optimistic about the reception to his promise to establish a new state-owned energy generator within a year of taking office.

>First announced in September last year at a Labour Party Conference that had the feel of a party preparing for government, it managed to deliver on two political fronts – uniting most of the party behind it, and accurately reading public mood in the face of ultra-high gas prices and the ensuing energy price crisis.

>Starmer, Ed Miliband and other shadow ministers have been eager to draw comparisons between the UK and its European counterparts, many of which have state-backed or partially state-backed energy generation companies. In his conference speech, Starmer cited “the largest onshore windfarm in Wales”, which is Swedish-owned, adding “energy bills in Swansea are paying for schools and hospitals in Stockholm”.

>Indeed, according to the TUC, if the UK had a state-backed energy generation company comparable to EDF (France), EnBW (Germany) or Vattenfall (Sweden), it would bring in between £63bn and £122bn in revenues over the next two years. Government could use these revenues - equivalent to £2,250-£4,400 per UK household - to reduce bills or accelerate home insulation roll-out.

>However, there is an internal contradiction at the heart of the party’s messaging around Great British Energy.

>If it is to be the UK’s EDF or Vattenfall, we would expect it to invest in well-established renewable energy technologies and large-scale generation plants, to turn the sort of profit required to be considered in a similar league – and to deliver sufficient revenues for a Labour government to reinvest.

>In contrast, Labour has highlighted that Great British Energy would make “strategic investment that the [private] companies shy away from”. If the focus of Great British Energy is to be on riskier investments, including investing in new technology in emerging industries like tidal energy, or in modular reactors, that would likely be of significant benefit to R&D and scale up prospects in less-well-established industries. But this would almost certainly mean a while before Great British Energy turned a profit and might mean it would require further investment from a Labour government before any financial benefits.

>Moreover, the question is not so simple as Labour deciding how much Great British Energy should invest in established versus emerging technologies. While the company would have operational independence, there is no reason why a Labour government could not enshrine in its mandate both objectives to invest a proportion of its funds in proven technologies that will make more profit – and greater impact on decarbonisation – more quickly, and also to invest a proportion of its funds into emerging and riskier technologies.

>The more challenging issue is that the UK does not lack for private investors with an appetite to invest in renewable energy – especially in established technologies such as wind and solar. There is a risk that a new state-backed company might simply jostle with private actors rather than actually accelerate the build out of renewable energy capacity. Labour appears to have anticipated this predicament and has emphasised that Great British Energy could co-invest with the private sector – and that it would focus on riskier investments, which takes us back to the profit versus R&D/scale up dilemma.

>This issue around how Great British Energy would interact with private sector investment is particularly acute where it concerns the Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme (the government’s main mechanism for supporting low-carbon electricity generation) which has supported significant growth in renewable energy capacity since its establishment in 2014.

>CfDs incentivise investment in renewable energy by providing developers of projects with high upfront costs and long lifetimes with protection from volatile wholesale prices, and they protect consumers from paying increased support costs when electricity prices are high. The most recent CfD auction round was described by the government as the most successful ever, with more than 11GW of renewables capacity securing contract.

>Developers of renewable projects who are successful in a competitive CfD auction enter into a private law contract with the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), a government-owned company.

>Would Great British Energy bid into future CfD rounds? While Labour’s plan is for Great British Energy to have operational independence, the matter of a UK Government-backed energy generator bidding into competitive auctions for private contracts with a UK Government-owned company requires serious thought.

>Might it instead look to develop renewable energy projects on a merchant basis? Volatile wholesale prices make this challenging, but far from impossible for well-established renewable energy technologies such as wind.

>Labour does not need to answer these specific questions immediately, but as we draw closer to a general election the party now thinks it stands a good chance of winning, it needs to be able to articulate a general argument for how Great British Energy will work that is not circular. The broad premise holds true that, in terms of European nations that have invested heavily in renewable energy, we are an outlier in lacking a state-backed energy company that can invest in new plants.

>Nevertheless, just as Labour is looking to pre-empt attacks on its £28 billion green investment pledge as we look ahead to autumn 2024, it needs to be prepared for more probing questions from the media and the energy industry on Great British Energy as we come to the long campaign. It also needs to have answers on the challenges ahead in launching Great British Energy in the event of a Labour victory

In a similar vein, I'd expect concentrated solar to be much cheaper than PV (after all, you only need some mirrors and a tower, instead of large semiconductor panels), but it isn't.

Germany has been making deals with middle-eastern countries to invest into solar and hydrogen infrastructure, so we will probably see more energy imports from there (unless this is just a ploy to greenwash the natural gas investments that we're making).

I never forget a post a while ago where someone asked why poor people buy takeaway.  A low-income redditor responded that sometimes her gas/electric has run out, she has no food and she has only, say, £2.  In a situation like this she can't buy food that needs cooking because she's got no gas or electric.  And in cold weather she doesn't want to buy fruit to eat, too cold.  The only sensible thing to do in a situation like that is spend the £2 on a cheap burger in McDonalds, at least it's a hot meal for the day.

Another redditor replied saying that was bollocks, that nobody lives like that, and was really nasty about it, really thought the woman was making it up.  The other redditor just genuinely did not believe that there were people out there so poor that they sometimes had no gas or electric, and could only afford one meal per day.

Jus the other day I commented on a thread (which now seems to have been deleted) about low-income people, saying that my income isn't enough to cover rent, utilities, food etc and I often run out of things like food and sanitary protection.  One redditor said it's my own fault for not knowing how to cook, because if you cook you can make your own meals for just £3-£4.  Well, I actually do in fact cook all of my own food from cheap ingredients, and £3-£4 a meal is still up to £120 a month, which is actually unaffordable for some people.  It's just this constant refrain that people who are struggling financially have only themselves to blame, they must all bebgetting takeaways and iphones and brand new trainers with every paycheck, and that's why their money doesn't last.  They just refuse to accept that we live in a world where people can budget carefully, buy nothing that's not strictly necessary, and still just not have enough money to last until their next paycheck.

Ah, maybe it has.  But for a couple of years since '99, I've not had to worry about water rates either because I lived in a rural area with our own bore and septic tank or because I lived in accommodation with water included.

Still, for those couple of years, I don't recall having a choice in who provided water (but maybe I didn't look hard enough).

> Since privatization in 1989 over £130 billion has been invested in the industry.

What reason is there to think that wouldn't have happened had water remained nationalised?  Or at least, that the private sector would have outperformed the public sector?  Privatisation of National Rail, after all, has hardly been a screaming success — particularly wrt investment in infrastructure and rolling stock.

Put another way, what is special about water that means that privatisation worked well in that sector where it didn't with energy?  Private/public management is a common factor so it can't be that.

> Water quality has risen dramatically

Technology may have had something to do with that.

> Ofwat has stated that prices would be at least 25% higher if the industry had stayed nationalized.

How could they possibly know that?

> In 1985 they raised the cost of water by 10%, when only a 3% rise was requested by the water industry, and used the other 7% on other things.

That's not cool, but nor is it anything particularly to do with water services. 
 It's a matter of fiscal policy, and if deprived of the opportunity for such covert tax rises, they'll just do it some other way.  Fiscal policy remains the problem.

Back when I worked in retail I tried to take a bit of pride in what I did. ""If you're gonna do a job you should at least do it well"" I always used to think. So when day this big fella comes into the store and he needs help figuring out which protein powder is best for him. I spent maybe an hour talking to him about the gym, training, diet, supplements, etc. He was a nice guy and you could tell he really wanted to make sure he was getting th right stuff. In the end he'd bought so many things an we'd spent so long chatting that I let him use my staff discount to bring the price down a bit. He was incredibly grateful and he went on his way.

Later that evening I was stepping out with one of the other guys that worked there to a club somewhere in South London. We live in North so it took about 45 minutes in a pretty pricey uber to get down there. We get to the door and the they're giving us some grief about something. Maybe we didn't have tickets or ID or were a bit late or something. We spent 15 minutes pleading our case, but it was falling on deaf ears. Defeated, we sucked it up and started heading towards the train station to make our way back home. Night ruined, before it even got started. 

I've turned away from the door staff and take not more than 3 steps before I run into who? You guessed it - the big fella from earlier that day! I told him that we were trying to get into the club but they were having none of it, but turns out he was the head doorman! He walked is in, sorted us out with free drinks once we were inside and kept an eye on us when one of our friends got a little too drunk. 

He explained very clearly that he helped me, because I had gone out of my way to help him.

In which case we'll have to re-evaluate our historical emissions drastically. China has made a competitive advantage out of polluting freely, that doesn't mean it's their god given right to do so. And they're now a middle income country, one of the most powerful countries in the world, they have to be held to the same standards as anyone else.

Wales,comment,weather,ivvf2ge,lkmirr,,"Congratulations! A perfect choice for a honeymoon - or any other reason to visit.

You've already received some fine advice here. I can't resist adding some tips. I've had the privilege of making quite a few visits to Wales over the years, including (after a 3-year absence) this past May. 

Here are my thoughts:

* End of April/beginning of May is a fine time to visit Wales. It's beginning to warm up. Lots of lambs in the fields. And, yes, you're likely to see some proper Welsh rain. But that's true whenever you visit.
* Consider renting a car for just part of your visit. You can focus more on enjoying the sights and sounds – and people.
   * As others have mentioned, you can get from Heathrow to Cardiff via bus or train. And, unless you (or your spouse to be) have had a lovely night's sleep on the plane, I wouldn't suggest having to drive in the UK right after an overseas flight.
   * Cardiff has buses, bikes to rent and lovely places to walk (and taxis, too). It'd be more of a pain to drive in the city, negotiating traffic and trying to find a place to park!
   * It's not at all difficult to get from area to area via bus and train (I expect the strikes will be fully sorted out by the time you arrive). Get the apps for TransportForWales/Cymru, Traveline and National Express for your phone.  And many (most?) of the key bus/coach services have schedules on their web sites. Don't miss out on the Cambrian Line which travels from Shrewsbury west to Machynlleth and then north onto the Llyn Peninsula. Yeah, you can drive that route, but it's a lot better to ride the train and watch the scenery.
   * Even some classic hikes can be accessed via public transport: Pen y Fan in the Brecon Beacons; the various routes up Snowdown (and other mountains) in the north. Once again, it's easier to hop on the bus than to drive (and park) on a narrow mountain road. And, of course, there are dozens of places to start/end a hike on the Wales Coast Path.
* There are some places worth having a car for. On my visit in May (for nearly 4 weeks!) I rented a car for only 4 *days* (picked up and dropped off in Swansea). That enabled me to visit Carreg Cennen Castle and Pentre Ifan, as well as pop around other spots in south/western Wales.
* Wales is beautiful in so many ways. Be sure to stop in the local cafes and pubs. Learn a few words in Welsh (lots of resources online). A simple ""diolch yn fawr"" (thank you) will be warmly appreciated, even if your pronunciation isn't perfect.

Yes, this is really long; it's my favorite topic! Hope it's useful.",2022-11-10T22:05:51+00:00

unitedkingdom,comment,weather,ih1dwku,Wanallo221,,"Yes.

There is a massive difference between 2 days of 36-40C heatwave, which happened because a high number of variables aligned (hot Saharan front, weak gulf stream front, no Arctic/Russian air front/etc). And a consistent, high 30’s to 40’s summer stretching from mid June- early September. 

This is not to say that the heatwave was just an anomaly and should be considered a freak event. Climate is changing to make those variables much more likely to align and intensify.

These events need to springboard action and momentum. Not hysteria and doomerism.",2022-07-21T11:43:41+00:00
unitedkingdom,comment,weather,j9g1m7l,Fringie,,"I've got a lot of plants so it's hard to say. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say I give the tomato plant around 25-35w 18 hours a day (which is more than it needs, I'm trying to get my other plants to grow quickly). I've got a spreadsheet to calculate the cost per month, but if I were to guestimate the cost per month, it's probably about 20-30 quid a month, but keep in mind I'm doing this for fun.


If I wanted to lower the costs, I would put the tomato plant on my window sill that gets a lot of sunlight and then give it a couple hours of led per day during winter just to make sure the tomatoes get enough sunlight (more sunlight makes them sweeter), that would bring the cost down a lot. And I would give it less light from the led, probably about 10w of light. If I wanted no cost, I would put a 1 kwh solar system in my garden and that should be enough for like 5-10 plants using the windowsill method.",2023-02-21T17:40:48+00:00
unitedkingdom,comment,weather,jb1wgeh,TheTelegraph,,"**From The Telegraph's Senior News Reporter, Neil Johnston:**  
Forecasters have warned this week could see the coldest day of the year so far as swathes of the country face a weather alert over freezing conditions.

  
The UK Health Security Agency issued the cold weather alert and has placed north-east England, north-west England and Yorkshire under a level three alert, with the rest of England at level two.

  
The level three alert means there is a 90 per chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to the vulnerable and elderly. All areas are under alert between 1am on Monday and midnight on Thursday.

  
Yellow weather warnings in Scotland and northern England

  
On Sunday yellow weather warnings for snow in Scotland were brought forward as Arctic air moved over the country and down to northern England.

  
The Met Office said temperatures could drop below minus 10C on Monday night on higher ground in northern Scotland, with northerly winds making it feel even colder. 

In some parts of Scotland temperatures could fall to as low as -15C over the coming nights while south of the border could also face below freezing conditions.

  
The wintry conditions could lead to up to 10cm of snow on higher ground in Scotland and 5cm at lower levels.  
The Met Office has warned those living in the areas covered by the weather warning to prepare for disruption to travel, with “some roads and railways likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services”.

  
From midnight on Sunday, the yellow warnings of snow and ice spread to north-western England and north-eastern Scotland, and creep further down the east coast as far as Hull on Tuesday.  
'Pretty cold conditions and snow showers'

  
Honor Criswick, a meteorologist for the forecaster, said: “We are expecting a few more snow shower outbreaks into this evening and seeing a bit more snowfall early on, which is why the warning was brought forward.

  
“We are expecting pretty cold conditions and snow showers over the next few days across Scotland and northern parts of England.

  
“Temperature wise, we could possibly see lows of minus 10C in the sheltered glens and higher ground across northern Scotland on Monday night, so it’s going to be feeling quite cold and the breeze is picking up a little bit so will be feeling rather chilly.”

  
She added that temperatures could drop below the previous low of this year set in January. “Potentially we could see some of the coldest temperatures so far this year. 

The lowest we have seen was in January at minus 10.4C, so we could see something turn lower than that.

  
“We are expecting between 5cm and 10cm of snow across higher ground, so if we see more accumulations on lower ground of between 2cm and 5cm we could see some travel disruption on Monday into Tuesday.”

  
Areas affected by the warnings could experience power outages, delays to road, rail and air travel, icy surfaces and some rural communities may be cut off by the freezing conditions.

  
Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: “During periods like this, it is important to check in on family, friends and relatives who may be more vulnerable to the cold weather, as it can have a serious impact on health.

  
“If you have a pre-existing medical condition or are over the age of 65, it is important to try and heat your home to at least 18C if you can.”
