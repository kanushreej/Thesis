It is called Musee des Beaux arts after the museum the painting is in and it is basically all about this- that the world goes on.

And this is how Brueghel has done the painting - the actual event it depict is a tiny thing in the corner.

> 
> *The collateral damage wrought by the pandemic is becoming clear, with lengthy waits for surgery and life-saving treatment*
> 
> Pills. Pain. Broken sleep. Such is life for Irene Winter, the manager of a community centre on a north London housing estate. “I can’t walk, I can’t drive,” she says. “At most I can stand for five or 10 minutes. The pain is excruciating. Like a knife cutting right through your bone. I take 13 pills a day but they just take the edge off. Sometimes I am screaming in pain.”
> 
> Winter, 60, who is waiting for a hip replacement, is one of tens of thousands of people who have been left in agonising limbo as NHS waiting lists reach record levels — silent casualties of a pandemic that has consumed the health service for months.
> 
> The mother of three had already been waiting a year to have her right hip replaced when the coronavirus struck. She was informed by phone message that her operation had been cancelled until further notice. “I’ve not heard anything since,” she says.
> 
> Winter is not alone. NHS England figures released last week show 2.2 million people have been waiting longer than the target 18 weeks for surgery — the highest since records began. Like Winter, 83,200 have waited more than a year. “These figures paint a really bleak picture ahead of the winter,” says Tracey Loftis, the policy director of Versus Arthritis, a charity that has seen a 200% surge in calls to its helpline.
>
> Since the start of the crisis, NHS hospitals have treated more than 100,000 patients with the virus, but that has come at a huge cost. Fearing hospitals would be overwhelmed, as they were in northern Italy, thousands of hospital beds were freed up by the simple expedient of stopping almost all routine, non-urgent surgery, outpatient appointments and referrals from mid-March through April, May and most of June. Only now, as hospitals prepare for a possible second wave, is the true extent of the collateral damage starting to emerge.
> 
> Many of the delayed treatments were for patients with cancer or other life-altering conditions. The number of prostate cancer referrals between April and June was the lowest for a decade, and almost half the number for the same time last year. Prostate Cancer UK estimates that as many as 3,500 men with undiagnosed higher-risk prostate cancer have missed checks.
> 
> Even those who had been given a diagnosis experienced delays in treatment that may have worsened their prognosis. Chris Romney, 64, a former RAF fighter controller, was settling into retirement in the Peak District with his wife, Laura, and looking forward to time with their grandchildren when a biopsy at the Royal Derby hospital in late January uncovered aggressive prostate cancer.
> 
> Surgery was scheduled for March 30, pitching Romney onto what he describes as “a complete emotional rollercoaster”. Lockdown began a week before his operation was due and his surgeon phoned to tell him all urology operations had been suspended. “In order to ramp up their capabilities to deal with the suspected flood of Covid patients, the trust had mothballed the theatre and turned it into a three-bed ward,” he said. “The equipment that was needed to do the operation was put into storage.”
> 
> With months to wait before he could be seen, Romney sought to pay for treatment but found private hospitals had been seconded to help the NHS — though in the event, many were not used. “You’re literally left just sitting there, with no options,” he says. “It was like a black hole.”
> 
> Eventually Romney was put on hormone therapy and finally had the operation on June 18, nearly three months late. “I was incensed by the fact that throughout this [the health secretary] Matt Hancock and the NHS people were maintaining it was business as usual,” he says. “It was a lie, just a simple lie.”
> 
> After recounting his experience on local radio, Romney says many people contacted him to say their radiotherapy or chemotherapy had been stopped or surgery delayed.
> 
> It’s a similar picture with bowel cancer, which is the UK’s fourth most common cancer and the second biggest cancer killer, but treatable and curable if caught early. “Bowel cancer services were already stretched at the start of the year, with too many people not being seen for urgent investigations, even before the coronavirus,” says Genevieve Edwards, the chief executive of the Bowel Cancer UK charity. “Screening and diagnostic services were paused across the four nations in March and are only now restarting in some areas. This has created a huge backlog that needs to be dealt with, and quickly.”

I'll copy and paste this from a different reply, but I disagree that automation would be more favourable under a worker-owned model when it's paired with the incentive to protect jobs. There is incentive under capitalism to replace as many workers as possible with automated systems that are vastly cheaper and vastly more productive. This is possible under socialism, however it requires turkeys voting for Christmas. 

This is somewhat of an own goal for me though as I'm supposed to be arguing the benefits of capitalism and mass lay-offs don't exactly scream 'workers utopia' but without socialism on a global scale, factories operating with the intention of keeping workers will fall behind automation-driven competition and likely close. My pal works as an automation engineer and while his job might be to replace maybe 100 people per year on the construction line with automated systems, maintaining a competitive edge over other factories allows the other 6000 people working there to keep their jobs. And when they're maintaining a competative edge, they can bid for and win additional manufacturing contracts and take on another influx of workers before automating their jobs.",2022-07-12T23:35:53+00:00

ukpolitics,comment,doctor,jd7n6fj,convertedtoradians,,">They can already reduce payments by leaving the NHS, reducing hours, or retiring early. This is what they already do.

Obviously, yeah. There's no disagreement about that. The point is that some mechanism could be added to allow reduction of payments by some other means than leaving the NHS.

And as of next tax year, of course, they won't won't need to do any of the above. Because there'll be no tax charges for anyone on pensions. DB or DC, public or private.

>We cannot attract or keep enough doctors let alone experienced ones, what services would you cut if you are cutting their package as cutting their pension is cutting their package significantly?

First of all, I'm not arguing the government's removal of the Lifetime Allowance should be undone. So I'm not talking about imposing any charges on anyone or reducing the value of anyone's package. As far as I'm concerned, we could continue with Hunt's measures, with no Lifetime Allowance and I could live with that.

Second, even in some hypothetical world where the Lifetime Allowance was put back, I wouldn't be arguing for doctors' packages to be cut. I'm perfectly happy for doctors to get a pay rise - so long as their pension accruals are handled in the way I describe above.

That's my thing: That either everyone's pension accrual rate lowers through tax when they hit the limit or noone's does.

It's perfectly possible to satisfy my requirements while each individual doctor also comes away with more money in his pocket in total, in fact.

>Pension is deferred salary, its deferred to save the government money now, increasing salary outside of that costs significantly more. 

Yes, it's an entitlement to future money and a liability for the state. But a DB has an equivalent cost that we can consider for valuation purposes. It's not quite calculated like this but you could think of it as: How much money would you need to buy an annuity that paid out that much per year on those terms? That's the equivalent value and it's the accrual of that value that - I believe - should be treated the same as DC pension pots.

(The technical differences in the calculations of the equivalence I gloss over).

The government and NHS management have failed to plan the medical workforce so there is now a colossal shortage of doctors. There are plenty of doctors for example who want to be radiologists - the competition is around 10:1. These are fully qualified doctors who can't get a place.

The country is so short of radiologists they are outsourcing it to private companies. The government and the NHS hate doctors because it thinks they have too much power.

So rather than train these thousands of doctors into radiologists which would be the neatest and most obvious solution, they are using PAs as pretend doctors.

The fault is also on PAs - they were originally created as assistants, but many have been holding responsibility which no doctor would ever dream of holding without proper training. They can get away with this because they aren't regulated, and if a mistake happens, it doesn't matter - they will just get a job somewhere else. One egregious example is a PA acting as the hepatology registrar for a children's liver unit in Birmingham - this is a super niche specialised area of medicine, and no doctor who hadn't been through a minimum 10 years of formalised training would dream of doing. Other consultants will be calling them for specialist level highly expert advice. This unregulated individual somehow believes they have the capability to do this.

I'll copy and paste this from a different reply, but I disagree that automation would be more favourable under a worker-owned model when it's paired with the incentive to protect jobs. There is incentive under capitalism to replace as many workers as possible with automated systems that are vastly cheaper and vastly more productive. This is possible under socialism, however it requires turkeys voting for Christmas. 

This is somewhat of an own goal for me though as I'm supposed to be arguing the benefits of capitalism and mass lay-offs don't exactly scream 'workers utopia' but without socialism on a global scale, factories operating with the intention of keeping workers will fall behind automation-driven competition and likely close. My pal works as an automation engineer and while his job might be to replace maybe 100 people per year on the construction line with automated systems, maintaining a competitive edge over other factories allows the other 6000 people working there to keep their jobs. And when they're maintaining a competative edge, they can bid for and win additional manufacturing contracts and take on another influx of workers before automating their jobs.",2022-07-12 23:35:53+00:00

You may be referred to PLT (psychiatric liaison team). PLT is a small team already and like all the other specialties, they will work across the hospital. So if there is a patient on the ward who is under PLT and is more immediately urgent, they will be with that patient and might not be finished for a little while. They also need to go over any history - have you been to this hospital before for  mental health concerns? Are there any notes on previous visits about this? what did the triage nurse write in their initial assessment? Do you have any immediate health problems or injuries which also need to be addressed?

In terms of being in a crowded area, if there is no space in a cubicle, unfortunately you may be placed in the waiting room. We have almost constant ambulances coming in plus walk ins who will need a Majors cubicle. If Majors is full and we have patients who were in minors but are getting more unwell and need Majors, the cubicles in minors will probably be full of them too. Some days we are also holding ambulances outside so there is a queue for beds even just for A&E.

If they end up deciding you do need to stay or they need to put you under a section, there will be a process they have to follow for that and it needs time. Waits for a bed can be very difficult, even for non PLT patients, and they need to find an appropriate space for you, whether that's here in the hospital if they have the facilities or another ward/unit. 

It is shit, and I am so sorry because I have been there, asleep in a corridor chair whilst security were watching me because I was taken in by a friend for a crisis, but I'm very sorry to say that's the state of A&E these days.

ukpolitics,comment,doctors,jd7n6fj,convertedtoradians,,">They can already reduce payments by leaving the NHS, reducing hours, or retiring early. This is what they already do.

Obviously, yeah. There's no disagreement about that. The point is that some mechanism could be added to allow reduction of payments by some other means than leaving the NHS.

And as of next tax year, of course, they won't won't need to do any of the above. Because there'll be no tax charges for anyone on pensions. DB or DC, public or private.

>We cannot attract or keep enough doctors let alone experienced ones, what services would you cut if you are cutting their package as cutting their pension is cutting their package significantly?

First of all, I'm not arguing the government's removal of the Lifetime Allowance should be undone. So I'm not talking about imposing any charges on anyone or reducing the value of anyone's package. As far as I'm concerned, we could continue with Hunt's measures, with no Lifetime Allowance and I could live with that.

Second, even in some hypothetical world where the Lifetime Allowance was put back, I wouldn't be arguing for doctors' packages to be cut. I'm perfectly happy for doctors to get a pay rise - so long as their pension accruals are handled in the way I describe above.

That's my thing: That either everyone's pension accrual rate lowers through tax when they hit the limit or noone's does.

It's perfectly possible to satisfy my requirements while each individual doctor also comes away with more money in his pocket in total, in fact.

>Pension is deferred salary, its deferred to save the government money now, increasing salary outside of that costs significantly more. 

Yes, it's an entitlement to future money and a liability for the state. But a DB has an equivalent cost that we can consider for valuation purposes. It's not quite calculated like this but you could think of it as: How much money would you need to buy an annuity that paid out that much per year on those terms? That's the equivalent value and it's the accrual of that value that - I believe - should be treated the same as DC pension pots.

(The technical differences in the calculations of the equivalence I gloss over).

ukpolitics,comment,doctors,kj9ammj,Frosty_Carob,,"Partially yes.

The government and NHS management have failed to plan the medical workforce so there is now a colossal shortage of doctors. There are plenty of doctors for example who want to be radiologists - the competition is around 10:1. These are fully qualified doctors who can't get a place.

The country is so short of radiologists they are outsourcing it to private companies. The government and the NHS hate doctors because it thinks they have too much power.

So rather than train these thousands of doctors into radiologists which would be the neatest and most obvious solution, they are using PAs as pretend doctors.

The fault is also on PAs - they were originally created as assistants, but many have been holding responsibility which no doctor would ever dream of holding without proper training. They can get away with this because they aren't regulated, and if a mistake happens, it doesn't matter - they will just get a job somewhere else. One egregious example is a PA acting as the hepatology registrar for a children's liver unit in Birmingham - this is a super niche specialised area of medicine, and no doctor who hadn't been through a minimum 10 years of formalised training would dream of doing. Other consultants will be calling them for specialist level highly expert advice. This unregulated individual somehow believes they have the capability to do this.

At one point, I started having insane headaches and chest paints for months - thank you phd, turned out it was just a manifestation of stress - and I had a CT, ECG, and MRI that was in a random shopping centre, saw an ENT and a neurologist all within a week or two - I never paid a penny up front. As you mentioned it was just a tax I had on my salary. Also, don’t forget dentistry. I had check ups, scale and polish and my wisdom tooth removed and that was covered, I never paid anything upfront. 

The German system was very very impressive, some criticisms I heard were that clinics didn’t communicate so sometimes you had to go from scratch rather than have detailed referral info. Also I never experienced chronic care for something like cancer, and I never was an inpatient overnight, and I never used a&e - so I can’t comment.

He was never suitable for the role whilst the other guy had years of experience in the role. It wasn't long before people noticed how shit he was so he left for a similar job elsewhere.

The former accountants, Johnston Carmichael, resigning. This was hush-hush for awhile.

JC's own audits of the accounts which make for interesting reading.

The SNP's inability to find another audit firm to take them on as a client. The firm that did at the last minute - AMS in Manchester - had no experience with political parties. Their sweet spot was dental surgeries and offering tax avoidance schemes through a sister company. Look at their ownership structure and it's easy to conclude how/why they stepped into the breach. 

AMS did sign off on the SNP's latest accounts but did so with a Qualified opinion. AMS flagged missing information around membership fees, donations, and raffle income. 

Manchester police later received a complaint which *appears* to be tied to the aforementioned Qualified accounts. 

There are other items you could add to your timeline but these are more rumor at this juncture. But as Woodward and Bernstein were told, just follow the money. 

As for the media dropping the ball, unfortunately investigative reporting is not as widespread as was once the case. Occasionally, however, the MSM do perform good work. I.e. The Times this past week re: Menzies.

> *By Joe Mayes 22 December 2020, 18:43 GMT*
> 
> *    **£84 million funding program to train new agents is depleted**
> *    **Britain due to need up to 50,000 agents to handle red tape**
> 
> A government fund set up to help companies process customs paperwork after Brexit is running dry, leaving Britain at risk of a shortage of trained professionals to keep trade flowing.
> 
> Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs,the U.K.’s tax-collecting agency, said it has allocated almost all the money from the Customs Grant Scheme, an 84 million-pound ($112 million) program to fund staff training and setting up new IT systems.
> 
> “If applications cannot be fulfilled due to funding, applicants will be placed on a waiting list to have funds allocated if and when funds are returned,” HMRC said in a statement. “Businesses may also want to look into support available through government-backed loans schemes like the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme.”
> 
> Trade between the U.K. and EU faces severe disruption if the post-Brexit paperwork burden cannot be managed: trucks arriving at the border risk being held up by customs officials for having the wrong documents, risking 7,000-truck-long queues at the border. The Port of Dover, Britain’s busiest crossing point with the EU, is already in chaos after France closed the border to prevent the spread of a new strain of the coronavirus.
> 
> The logistics industry estimates U.K. companies will need as many as 50,000 extra customs agents when Britain leaves the EU’s single market and customs union on Dec. 31, because freight moving across the border will be need to be accompanied by a customs declaration. An extra 400 million of them are expected to be filed annually, at a cost of about 13 billion pounds, even if the U.K. and European Union reach a trade deal.
> 
> 
> The number of customs agents in the U.K. was about 15,000 a year ago, according to evidence given by Logistics U.K., a trade body, to Parliament in November. In September, a survey by the British International Freight Association found that 64% of respondents didn’t think they’d have sufficient staff to handle the post-Brexit workload.
> 
> HMRC said the sector expects to see a near fourfold increase in its capacity to process customs declarations, and that Britain is “well prepared” to deal with the changes at the end of the year.
> 
> “We are very concerned that any delays that arise because we have not got the right people in the right place at the right time will make it harder for U.K. businesses to trade with our European neighbors,” a panel of U.K. lawmakers led by Hilary Benn, chair of the Future Relationship with the European Union Committee, said in a report last week. “The government must stand ready to address any shortages in personnel.”",2020-12-23T00:59:53+00:00

In Catholicism marriage is a sacrament between a man and a woman. Same sex marriage and homosexual activity are sinful. Leaders in the church have campaigned against it. [Here’s a BBC article reporting on one of the cardinals in Scotland leading a campaign against it in 2012](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-18847588.amp)

> This is true! But there is a distinct difference, again, between, ""I don't believe in eating meat"" and, ""I don't believe anyone should eat meat."" The former is personal.

There’s a difference between personally believing that I shouldn’t drive at 80mph and believing no-one should. And no-one is allowed to. 

There’s a difference between personally believing that I shouldn’t be married to more than one person ant a time and believing no-one should. And no-one is allowed to.

There’s a difference between personally believing that I should pay tax and believing everyone should. And everyone has to.

There’s a difference between personally believing that I shouldn’t protest outside abortion clinics and believing no-one should. And no-one is allowed to.

When you live in society then you are subjected to rules that you don’t always agree with. That’s normal.

> The 'ultra' part is an inability to separate what should be a personal viewpoint from a social viewpoint.

Marriage is a public relationship that is witnessed by members of the public, regulated by the state and given a certain social standing. It’s quite legitimate to have views on what form of marriage is good for society and the ECHR has affirmed that. If you want a private relationship no-one is stopping you. If you want certain legal rights then they are available through social partnerships. If you think your relationship is nothing to do with anyone else then why demand that it be recognised by the state? Is marriage is purely private then why is it regulated at all?

> If I tried to enforce that on others then that would go against one of the core principles of a free democracy. If you try to force others to adhere to your viewpoints you are likewise acting against democracy. To claim otherwise is honestly insane.

So then, because the cretins have been arguing with me about this for some time now and I have a memory longer than a few hours, the argument goes like this.

Someone goes and digs up [this article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2607492/Tests-foreign-doctors-harder-pass-ensure-patient-safety.html) which claims that foriegn trained doctors are trained to a lower standard than British doctors.

I say that is a problem with our procedure for employing foreign trained doctors not a problem with the doctors per se. 

The cretin will then start asking why we can't employ British Doctors instead.

I say there aren't enough.

The cretin will then say that this is because there are too many immigrants.

>When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide. Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride. Till I get to the bottom and I see you again. 

So the next bit of the argument goes like this:

Me: What do you want to do about the immigrants then?

Cretin: Points Based Australian Style Immigration System.

Me: But the shortage of doctors, you say, is down to the amount of immigrants we have here already. The Points Based Australian Style Immigration System won't solve that problem.

Cretin: It will stop it from getting any worse / It will be a good start.

Me: But how will you address the existing problems?

<*tumbleweed*>

And this is why [I suggested](http://en.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/2y5nji/meta_mods_redditors_lets_have_an_immigration/) that maybe it would be nice if we forego the pleasures of the repetitive immigration argument for a week.

The proposal was downvoted onto page three within about 28 minutes.

And so we get to the crux of why this argument is enacted *ad nauseum.* The Model for this discourse is still /pol and their ""daily reminders"" system.

unitedkingdom,comment,gp,fo40c0c,Redscoped,,"American is nuts at the moment. Then again we should keep in mind in the last 3 months in our country 51 5G masts have been attacked. The USA does not have a monopoly on idiots in the country.

I think in part one of the problem is the USA does not have much of a safety net. When trump said ""The USA was not made for shutting down"" I thought well that is stupid because what country is ? However the USA has very little support if you are out of work. their is not country wide system. For example unemployment payments are state based they work like insurance you pay into the state and they pay out if your out of work. However those payments only last 6 months. 

Health care is another issue because again that is linked into having a job and playing into a plan to pay for it. If you are not working you have no health care in effect.

I know it is more ""complex"" and to say their is no support is not true but you have this complex system between government and state which leaves a lot of gaps. If american is not working the system falls apart.

The other issue is Americans dont trust government / or state control. They have this idea drilled into them everything is about freedom and anything which impacts self determination is seen as a communist plot. I have seen it in some pictures that the lock down is being seens as a communist control. The shadow of the cold war is cast across the country in ways which in europe never was. It leaves they with this distrust of the government even if they are working in the best interest of the people to save their lives.

Other universities in a similar part of the country are considered ""better"", such as Birmingham and Nottingham.  However, as a result, Derby Uni is significantly cheaper - as an international student, you won't be eligible for financial support at any UK university.  I would say though, if the content of the course appeals to you, don't dismiss it out of hand just because it's not Oxford or Cambridge.  I also don't know how the university is thought of specifically in the context of Health and Social Care - many universities are regarded differently in different industries.  Also, it may make a difference whether you are expecting to be seeking employment in the UK or US afterwards.

I'm Derby born and bred though, and I do love the city.  We have proper history (something that will be a new concept for you  :P ).  We have a *lot* of parks, Derby Arboretum is said to be one of, if not the, oldest free to enter public park in the UK.  There's a wide range of restaurants and cafes, be they national chains, local chains or one-offs.

The Derby Museum and Art Gallery has permanent local exhibits, including a gallery of paintings by Joseph Wright of Derby, and frequent temporary exhibits usually lasting 4-10 weeks (entry is free).  We also have a cinema at the Quad, which shows older and sometimes artsy films.

Further afield, the county of Derbyshire is full of quaint little villages, many of which have their own local events in the summer, and Ashbourne has the only remaining [Shrovetide Football](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Shrovetide_Football) event in the UK - the only sporting event I've ever been to in which violence is frowned upon, but not explicitly banned - even if you don't pick Derby, if you're in the UK, the spectacle is something not to be missed.  It's about a 30 minute bus or car journey to the next nearest city of Nottingham, and about a 45 minute train journey to England's second city of Birmingham.  So all in all, I doubt you'd want for things to do!

My sister is about to graduate in BSc Business and Marketing from Derby Uni, if you wanted to know anything about being a student there.  I'm not expecting her home for a few hours though.

Edit: Oh, also, we have stately homes, which often have special events throughout the summer, such as open air film screenings and live performances.  I'm hoping to go to an open air *A Midsummer Night's Dream* this summer at [Keddlestone Hall](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/kedleston-hall/).

tories,comment,health,j6tpnn5,CarpeCyprinidae,,"I've felt for a while that much of social security should be replaced seamlessly at the back-end by a system generally funded in the same way that private contribution-based pensions are....    

This is my theory as to one way it could be done

 * Government increases the National Insurance contribution by 1%  
 * Additional revenue is ringfenced and handed over to a commercial fund manager or (possibly better) a range of them, all operating under a standard private sector fund management contract
 * The funds inflowing to the fund managers are invested in a range of securities and bonds, and the value of the overall fund is indexed by date.  
 * Each individual taxpayers NIC contributions are recorded by value and month, so over time the total value in the fund attributable to any individual taxpayer is known.   
 * After a period of 10 years, when a taxpayer makes use of social-security funded services their cost is first funded by a withdrawal from the general fund, allocated as a withdrawal from their hypothetical personal NIC fund value, but only down to the point that their ""personal"" fund is exhausted, after which state funding kicks in  
 * At this time the rate of NIC is reduced by 1%, and as the general spend rate falls off due to being partly funded by capital growth in the NIC investment fund, more of the current NIC revenue is put into the fund managers control  
 * Over time it would be possible to fund a significant proportion of all social security spending from commercial fund management operations, using a slowly increasing proportion of national insurance contributions to keep topping up the fund as the proportion of social security costs funded by it increases.   
 * The personal funds of deceased taxpayers would pass to a general fund to pay for social security costs of taxpayers whose personal pots are exhausted
 * Al this can be achieved without meddling with the public-facing side of NIC / Social security at all - or more to the point, it can be done independently of the political decision as to what the social security landscape looks like.   

If the future is dominated by Tory thinking, the existence of hypothetical pots could be used to control entitlement to benefits, if thinking moves more to the left, the presumed reduction in cost to the state might be used to fund other social endeavours.  

Either way, it allows the drag on the state sector finances represented by having socialised benefits in a country with an ageing population to be reduced

Potentially, taxpayers could opt for inclusion and for the higher NIC rate on a promise of higher payout rates of they claim unemployment benefits etc",2023-02-01 20:40:08+00:00

I'm not going to say its a panacea, and I'm not going to say it has made everything better, and my long term experience is now about 6 months.

But I haven't had to take sick days, don't get as distracted at work, forget things less, get more housework done, remember to actually do basic self care, forget to eat less, and combining in with *hard work and life changes* has been transformational.

I also had the run around for years on meds as a teen. And it fucking sucked. And everyone should be wary, and it isn't going to make it all better.

But I trick myself a lot. I constantly end up going ""is it that different? Do I really have adhd?"" And if I take breaks from my meds remind myself that I very, very much do. I did that a lot when I was more depressed though, one good day makes you forget the bad days and the self loathing kicks in.

For example, if you have for example a product which is in any way processed, then it is easy for problematic ingredients to be less obvious. Oats for example are naturally gluten free.

And once milled, they could contain traces or gluten from other grains milled in the same mill which makes anyone with a gluten allergy sick. Having  to have a detailed knoweledge of the production conditions of all items is unrealistic for most folk. So you have to have a strict law which has some funnx side effects such as bags of nuts having to declare the presence of nuts.

* How is placing a much higher entry bar (read: tons of cash to pay for ISPs benevolence) not stifling innovation on any given market, especially tech/web that pretty much evolves through disruption above all else? Economical fact: the harder is it to enter a given market, the less dynamic that market becomes, and before long you see cartels appearing and essentially locking it until that paradigm changes ─think oil, pharma, energy. Must we do that to internet as well?

* How is it not a fact that there is no European Apple, or Google, or Facebook, or Amazon, Microsoft...? How likely would it be that such a rising star emerges in a market that's locked behind a giant paywall? You'd essentially be begging these innovators and entrepreneurs to take their business ideas elsewhere, as they simply couldn't rise in their own domestic market in Europe. As if that wasn't already a huge issue.

* How is saying *f.u* to disruption not essentially saying in economical terms that we don't trust/value those who come after us, as we essentially lock everything today to benefit those who are already at the top, thereby further aggravating the already dire lack of social mobility? I don't think it needs to be proven that liberalism, economic freedom, is beneficial to society. I'm not sure how it is not a fact that bringing about a cartel's legal haven isn't just about the very opposite of anti-trust, the pursuit of a free market.

* How is it not a fact that a vast majority of European peoples never voted for more debt? How is it not a fact that a majority of people who have an opinion in the matter are against such SOPA-like legislation? Do know of the EFF, would you say they are as clueless as european politicians as far as technology is concerned?

* How is it not a fact that democracy is at a historical low level, so much that it's constitutionally and statistically (read: scientifically) a fallacy to even call it a democracy?

You need only step from the deprived North Side of Dublin to the wealthy South side to see the huge wealth inequality that has developed under Dail policies. 

Throw in a huge housing crisis in Greater Dublin and beyond (look at Mica in Donegal) and it's quite clear that the Dail cannot manage the 26 counties. So why should it be put in charge of 32?

N.I may not be perfect but it is a more socialised and fairer society than R.O.I, by virtue of its history. 

People talk about investment and growth as if they are always good things, but Dublin shows, not everyone benefits from untamed capitalism. Someone has to lose for it to work.

With opioids it's obvious, but with cocaine I have no clue if my girlfriend has overdosed. Is this typical? I have seen an opioid overdose and it was very obvious. However I honestly can't tell when my girlfriend has had too much cocaine, So it's very hard to help. She has the same behaviour when she is high as when she has overdosed. The only way I know she has overdosed is when she tells me. When she's taken too much I drive her to the ER. 

To summarize: How do I honestly know if someone is overdosing on cocaine? How do I know they are not just really high on the drug but not at risk of overdosing? I don't feel like driving my girlfriend to the hospital every time she gets high if there is no point.

I have lived all over this fair land of ours and can honestly say Bristol has everything, I would say it has more than London does in the sense of countryside, towns, quiet villages with country pubs galore and a decent city centre.

The graffiti scene in Bristol is next level as you would expect being the home of Bansky, but the city actively supports graffiti and there are weekends dedicated to it with music events etc. Speaking of the music scene it is very diverse and has a lot going on. ST Paul's carnival (Think maddigra) the Bristol brewery tour, where all the breweries open their doors and basically Bristol gets hammered, OH speaking of the breweries OMG if you are keen on trying some of the finest ales or the local cider it's divine, I highly recommend Wiper and True, There's harbour fest, the restaurants and pubs are all great, always things going on that gets people out.

The people for the most part are friendly, it's the land of "" Alright mate!, sup geezer, cheers drive, gert lush, ere have you seen, basically every word that has a H at the beginning say with out saying the H part lol) I love Bristolian's and there *Lush* accents (everything is Lush here apparently);(or Gert Lush) Lol, don't hear it as much in the centre but get into the neighborhoods etc haha especially after a few beers it's like it brings out their inner farmer pmsl, oh and the Wurzels 🤦.

Its biggest issue is public transport, no trams, rail links across the city are sparse however there is a plan to bring a lot of old stations back online.

There is a very active public concern about what is going on in the wider world with many demonstration etc, Greta has been to Bristol etc which is from what I have seen is supported by the wider community so it's not a case of "" not another bloody protest "" it's "" Let's go check it out "" .

1: You claimed that a video of children being killed by the IDF was ""pallywood lies.""

2: You have claimed that palestinians aren't being killed and that they are lying, while using a pro IDF isreali news outlet as your source.

3: Argued that Jewish only streets do not exist despite corroboration from Human Rights watch and Amnesty international stating they do.

4: ""There was no ethnic cleansing happening before october 6th, and there is no genocide now""

5: You have claimed that nearly everyone killed by the IDF isn't actually innocent and are in some way related to Hamas.

6: You have claimed that Isreal isn't stopping food and medical aid from getting through borders despite both the organisations delivering them stating that they very much are.

7: You claimed that the 7th of october was unprovoked, ignored the over 200 palestinians killed by the IDF in august, and straight up denied that it had happened.

Scotland,comment,hospital,hrsk4mk,me1702,,"That’s the picture in my health board. I know of at least two of our wards are entirely “COVID positive patients with other diseases”. 

However, whilst this is a welcome change in some ways, it’s not without issues. 

1. This is still reducing capacity. COVID positive patients need to be cohorted on separate wards and isolated from COVID negative patients. This has, in our board, further reduced capacity for planned surgery. Two elective wards have become COVID wards. 
2. COVID positive patients, regardless of the reason for admission, have higher rates of thromboembolic disease (DVTs, PEs), which can complicate admission and prolong stay. It can also lead to mortality. 
3. For surgical patients, you have reduced throughput in operating theatres due to the need for air changes, PPE and enhanced cleaning. 
4. People who swab positive on arrival may not have pneumonitis when they get into hospital, but that may well develop over the course of their admission. For this reason, I don’t think you can really get information on this until patients have been successfully discharged. 

More anecdotally, I’d say that wards of “incidental” COVID positive patients are also intrinsically less efficient. On a true COVID ward, you’d have maybe two teams of doctors getting on with things. Now, we have surgical COVID wards where there’s multiple specialties. Instead of one or two teams, there can easily be more than a dozen fighting over the ward which just creates all sorts of challenges. And from a nursing side, providing specialist care across multiple specialties (eg neurosurgery, upper GI surgery, plastic surgery, vascular surgery, orthopaedic surgery) is often just not possible. 

However, there’s definitely been a welcome reduction in unwell COVID. It hasn’t disappeared entirely, but we have about a quarter of the ICU patients we’d expect to have (based on hospital numbers from past waves) which eases pressures greatly.",2022-01-08T16:32:17+00:00

We have handed over the keys to one of the world's largest employers and most intricate delivery network to people who genuinely have no concept of what they are tinkering with. It's like me taking an antique 200 year old clock which is still running and needs a servicing down to the local car wash for a spot of pressure washing  cleaning in the hands of someone who started the job 3 days ago. 

Both labour and the tories need to be called out on theor bullshit manifestos and plans. Unfortunately the tories also have 15 years of pretty horrendous vindictive cuts to the very service which everyone relied on for 3 years to literally save the very fabric of the country. They are naturally going to get the brunt of the critisism because they have gone far far beyond losing just credibility and are now probably the most despised democratically appointed political entertiy ruling a nation on this earth. 

The one and only solution is to set up a 20 year cross party, cross chamber committee soley responsible for health legislation, a separate professionally staffed body akin to the BOE with ring fenced funding of inflation + 2% to use to meet the defined goals and work force planning as set out by the committees described above. This short termism has to end.

This isn't how the system functionally works though.

At any one time, its the workers who pay for the pensioners. Its staggered by one generation.

They don't hold the money paid in by workers until their retirement, that money is used to cover the needs of the current generation of pensioners *until* that generation of workers becomes pensioners themselves upon which their children who are now working pay for them.

This is why pensions are such a huge issue, the boomer generation which are the current generation of pensioners make up such a disproportionately large slice of the demographics that no generation after them can afford to pay the boomers pensions. This is made worse through things like the triple lock, assets like houses which have gained in value above that of pay, etc etc. Then add to that that the political landscape is dominated by the same boomers who vote for parties with policies that protect them, and due to the voting system there isn't a damn thing anyone can do it about. Oh, and the knock on effect of all this is that the younger generations can't then afford to have children, which compounds the upside-down population pyramid even further.

Its also why the person who you are talking to is angry, because the majority of current generation workers will not see a pension scheme anywhere near as prosperous (if at all) of the current pensioners.",2023-07-31 17:18:26+00:00

There is a very good reason why people think this. It is because time and again the UK government has proven itself to be incompetent and almost always chooses the worst solution or fucks it up even more.

Consider the Ministry of defence:
https://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/British_Military_Procurement_Mysteries Look at all those fuck ups.

So in a sea of fuck ups where the government goes overbudget (haha the UK government talked about cross rail being on budget on time and then fucked it up :D) you think that they will suddenly become competent? 



On top of this you also have to realise the UK is becoming Americanised. Look at astroturfing, gerrymandering and workfare all of these things originated in the US. Hell the shrinkage of HMRC was also an emulation of the US IRS system. In fact if you look closer you'll see even racist slurs cross the atlantic and be used in the UK.

Therefore while you say you won't copy the US system I doubt you will. The UK government will invariably come up with something worse.

Thinking some more about this... I remember back in my ACCA days when NIC was to be merged with income tax. Loads of administrative savings it was touted. Except some very smart people noticed NIC and income tax merger would cut the historic link of 'me stamp' (literally people would be given stamps in the past) and various rights associated with it.

So sure today you pay 20% income tax and 11.8% NIC the 11.8% NIC is entitlement to government services.

Tomorrow you pay 31.8% income tax but no NIC! So no more government services.

So you're both paying the higher taxes AND private insurance ontop !",2019-06-05 17:28:54+00:00

europe,comment,medical,ghb5645,Specific_Bowler,,"An army of more than ten thousand medics and volunteers has been recruited by the NHS to help deliver the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, once it is given approval.
The Telegraph has learned that teams are trained and ready to begin giving the jab at sports stadia and race courses across the country, with a target of vaccinating at least a million people each week.

The Oxford/AstraZeneca jab could be approved early next week by the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), after the final cut of data was submitted by the Government last Monday.

Officials have pinpointed January 4, 2021 as the date the rollout of the mass vaccination programme will begin.

A Government source said: “At the moment, we are operationalising everything for the 4 January for the first Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs in arms. You’ll see it everywhere, while we’ll also be carrying on with Pfizer.”
The source added: “Tens of thousands of vaccinators and support staff have been recruited.”

They are expected to be delivering at least a million jabs a week to the vulnerable by the middle of next month, once manufacturing has been scaled up.
Village halls, community centres and other local sites overseen by GPs will be used to administer the vaccine alongside vast regional hubs.

How does the Oxford vaccine work? The Telegraph can also reveal that ministers are looking at proposals to triple the length of the time between taking a first and second dose of a vaccine in order to speed up the delivery of the vaccine before Easter.

It comes as frontline NHS workers have been told they will soon receive the Oxford vaccine, and amid calls for teachers to be prioritised alongside health workers for the jab to help keep schools open.

The head of AstraZeneca, Pascal Soriot, has also revealed the company has come up with a ""winning formula"" which has boosted the effectiveness of the jab so that it matches the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.
Britain has ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford jab, with 40 million expected to be available by the end of March. Manufacturing is due to scale up significantly from the second half of January.

The ease of delivering the vaccine, compared with the complicated cold chain required for the Pfizer jab, and low cost mean its approval is viewed as a game-changing development in Westminster.
Tale of the tape: Pfizer/BioNTech v AstraZeneca/Oxford v Moderna The rollout of the Oxford jab is a core element of the Government’s exit strategy from tough lockdown measures, as concerns grow over the damage to the economy wrought by keeping whole sectors shut.

Ministers are aiming for all vulnerable Britons included in its priority list of nine vulnerable groups, which cover around a quarter of the population, to receive a first dose of the jab by the end of February, and a second dose by the end of March.

Once this feat is achieved, mortality from the illness will be reduced by up to 99 per cent.
It is hoped the tougher lockdown restrictions can be lifted at that point.

At present, 43 per cent of the population is living under Tier 4 restrictions, which require Britons to stay at home and the hospitality industry and non-essential retail to close, after emergency measures were implemented on Boxing Day ahead of the fortnightly review scheduled for December 30.

Ministers will still meet on Wednesday to review the latest data, with a series of other areas set to be plunged into Tier 4. Burnley, Cumbria and Lincoln are thought to be at risk of moving into the toughest tier.
Last night senior doctors warned the NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, as the number of coronavirus patients in hospital is about to exceed the peak of the first wave.

Former Tory party leader Lord Hague of Richmond last week warned the Prime Minister to undertake “a national mobilisation of resources on a scale never before seen outside of war” to accelerate the vaccine rollout in the face of the new hyper-infectious mutant strain of Covid-19.

Government insiders have credited Minister for the Vaccine Rollout, Nadhim Zahawi, UK vaccine taskforce chief Kate Bingham, and St John Ambulance, for scaling up infrastructure and personnel ready for the rollout next month.

A high proportion have been recruited by St John Ambulance, which reached out to its network of 25,000 volunteers, while also partnering with the Royal Voluntary Service, British Red Cross and other charities.
Ministers have a target of enlisting 10,000 vaccinators, 14,350 care volunteers to observe people after they have received the jab, and 6,150 patient advocates to welcome and process people arriving at centres.
Retired doctors and nurses, pharmacists and trained first aiders have been drafted in to administer jabs, while other members of the public have signed up as support staff.

A Government source also revealed that ministers are looking at proposals to triple the length of the delay between taking a first and second dose of a vaccine in order to give millions more a single dose more quickly, while waiting for more deliveries of doses.

Proposals to offer Britons only a single dose have been shelved, but ministers are examining the idea of extending the time between doses from between three and four weeks to around 12 weeks.
A Government source said: ""Everyone will get two doses, nobody will only get a half dose, but it could be a longer period, up to 12 weeks, between jabs. You could get a better impact.

""The MHRA will look at this stuff and decide what’s the best thing to do to get the most effective vaccination programme in the fastest, safest way possible.""
Pfizer vaccine rollout perfect scenario However, the insider added that a longer delay between doses would become redundant once sufficient quantities of the jab became available, saying: ""We're getting the volume coming now with Oxford/AstraZeneca, so it could become academic.""

The Pfizer results were based on a regime of two doses 21 days apart, while the Oxford vaccine was given 28 days apart.

The MHRA determines the dosing regime based on submitted evidence, so moving to a single dose, or a delayed second dose regime, would be experimental and could leave the government liable to legal action.
While those waiting longer for a jab would not be disadvantaged in the long term, they would be more at risk in the delay period before the second injection.
However, the Government could decide to initiate a clinical trial within the general rollout and monitor the efficacy of a delayed second jab among consenting participants.

Previous studies of vaccines have shown that delaying a second dose does not usually result in reduced long-term efficacy.",2020-12-28 18:16:38+00:00

I've just seen Pakistan go from the best PM they've had in my lifetime to the absolute GUTTER, the opposition who are now in power are literally a hive of villainy and scum - not a single leader within the opposition has either not been in jail or does not have an open court case against them. Following democratic processes of course.

You will see, many, many Pakistanis prefer military rule, just because its stable. I've only had one experience of it myself and it wasn't a great time, but for my home state, Punjab, compared to the democratically elected government that followed, it was a damn sight better. I'm very opposed to martial law though, I'm not a fan of the army, especially not now after they so brazenly orchestrated this entire affair.

If there was a person out there who installed programmes for the very poor in society to have free shelter and food, and installed a national health insurance policy (which BTW, the opposition has been in government for a matter of days and hospitals have already stopped refusing out of fear of funds not being released) then I would prefer that person to have a period of maybe 10 or 15 years uninterrupted rule. Might be undemocratic, but would be a lot better for the country, and the bottom line is, the country needs to get better. You think I, as a woman, am proud of the fact that Pakistan is not safe for me to go around and do as I please? Of course not.

Democracy is very much a luxury and Pakistan's democracy is in every way a true failing of the system. Broken from top to bottom. Why not have a civilian led dictatorship now?

While there are a few things you could do about recruitment (more bursaries and paid routes in, higher starting salaries), retention is largely a problem because of the workload and working conditions. Some of that could be dealt with by increasing funding, but mostly only if that was enough to hire a lot more staff, both teaching and non-teaching.

But even there, we’re struggling to recruit and retain TAs for the roles we have funding for, because they’re leaving for better paid jobs elsewhere (and who can blame them?). Combined with us trying to plug the gaps from a lack of broader support for students who should have had diagnoses and help years ago (but are on waiting lists), should be receiving counselling, should be receiving various therapies, should have support to give them clothes, food, respite care, it feels to me like this is more systemic.

I’m not sure how much is possible to resolve just by focusing on teacher recruitment and retention, or even just by focusing on schools, unless you were going to recruit a load of other specialists to work in schools in other roles and turn schools into child-hubs.

AskUK,post,medical school,uoru4r,grade4haemorrhoids,How would you feel about your local A and E being led overnight by a physiotherapist or nurse as opposed to a emergency medicine doctor?,"Given the royal college of emergency medicines recent announcement about potentially moving towards having non doctors being the 'emergency physician in charge' (EPIC) overnight how would you feel about a non doctor leading your A and E out of hours? And how aware at the general public that this is the direction of travel?



For comparison of the training pathways:

An ED doctor to be EPIC: 5-6 years of med school, 2 year house officer, 4 years EM training minimum. (12 years total) plus then a further 4 years to consultancy once able to be EPIC. Many doctors also do additional years of fellowships or educational roles so will have much more experience than this. Arduous Royal college exams. Requirement to have a massive burdensome portfolio. High GMC indemnity and college fees. Average working week 48-56 hours.

Or an allied healthcare professional: 3 year degree with lower entry requirements, 3 years of experience working, 3 year master degree. Average working week 37.5 hours. 

ACPs also do not have to move around hospitals during their training. Meaning some will never work in major trauma centres and won't have the same breadth of experience. This has concerned some stakeholders.

This is not to discount the valuable role ACPs have in hospitals. They are very good in their specific roles.

There has been outrage from the medical profession over these moves. See r/juniordoctorsuk. What is the British publics take?

EDIT: there seems to be some misunderstanding the EPIC is the senior medical decision maker. I.e. they decide who gets discharged who gets referred what the management of the patients condition is.",2022-05-13 13:31:52+00:00

~ [Scottish independence: Price warning letter due as business row intensifies](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29169114)

Now from a brief bit of searching, I can see much hand wavey warnings from various retailers about ""prices will inevitably rise"", but it's all a bit vague, with no actual percentage figure (as far as I can see).

(Also, at no point that I can recall, was there ever any mention of food rationing, medicine rationing, or martial law, but I digress).

#In 2019 we have this:

> Such intense food shortages, almost overnight, will have one obvious outcome: price rises. But this is where Lang disagrees with Johnson’s government, which is expecting an increase of 10 per cent.

> “I think it will be higher,” he tells me. “As I said in my article, in the 14-page document prepared by the Cabinet Office – widely presumed to be what made Boris Johnson look ashen-faced when he came out of a briefing – Sir Mark [Sedwill, the cabinet secretary and national security adviser] said 10 per cent food price rises.  

> **“Most people in the food industry think [10 per cent] at least,” he says, with a heavy emphasis on the last two words. “And it depends on the level of the pound, of course. The pound is going down already.”**

Scotland,comment,nhs,k7863jg,abz_eng,,"There are numerous problems with the NHS **but** no politician will admit them as they are effectively election suicide

* The NHS was set up on the premise that once the country was *got well* the bills would go down. They've only ever gone up
* The NHS is a reactive service. Got a broken bone, they can fix that. Got a problem that needs investigation? Tests are expensive and take money, that is needed elsewhere, so we might test for X and see the result. Then we'll see how you are and might test for Y, await the results of that before testing for Z. Whereas if you do lots of tests the individual costs come down and people aren't ill as long - but to get there will mean all additional money has to go to prevention and not the waiting list. The change would take 5 years to see effects, that's 5 years of waiting list headlines
* The patients are a problem. We don't look after ourselves, we **expect** and demand the NHS picks up the pieces e.g. Cardio rehab, one guy refused to do it ""they just put in another stent"" FFS that's the attitude of some and the staff can **not** say anything. No politician is going to tell the voters they need to really buck their ideas up and do unpalatable things
* Moving off the NHS model to a **mutual** insurance model aka most European ones with some private involvement - the German Health Insurers become responsible for Sick pay (Krankengeld) after 6 weeks, as an incentive to get you well - that's on top of them realising that testing saves money in the long term (less sick pay / lower cost of treatment). But mention changing the model & the headlines will literally **SCREAM** ""24 hours to save the NHS"" or American model is **the only possible option being done** or such fucking nonsense - so no politician will stick a hair above the parapet 
* closing local hospital as it's in the wrong place, out dated, needs rebuilt, and isn't fit for purpose? Even if every local GP, NHS body, Ambulance staff, police, fire inspection, health inspection, etc agreed, if there is a local campaign to *save our hospital* the politicians have to publicly fall in line else they will be dumped

The most important and difficult part of medicine is the triage - most countries and every military hospital uses the most experienced staff to triage patients. 

I am saying that you should have senior doctors triaging you. There is officially no money to hire GPs (the best at community triage) however the govn has found £1.4 billion to allow GP practices to hire anyone but GPs. Now there are hundreds of GPs without work.

NHS struggling for money and cant hire new staff (& I work in the NHS) - but few years back £3billion spent on locums, sometimes even with all evidence pointing to saying we need them permanently & the staff member wants to be permanent. They are also spending huge amounts of money paying private companies to do extra work - but private company is hiring back the same NHS staff and even hiring the NHS building & equipment - but all the private company is doing it adding a healthy profit margin for themselves (this is privatised insourcing).

My point is the NHS has money when senior govn leaders want to do something. They always have money. The govn just want to think how poor NHS service is & it cant be saved & want you to go private. Its how to privatise any public service - underfund, run it into the ground, then everyone “made a choice” to go private.

It could absolutely be fixed and the great ppl of this country deserve that - but theres too much money to be made making healthcare private for govn to care.",2024-05-18 06:52:33+00:00

You can’t eliminate government spending from healthcare, because there will *always* be people who can’t afford it. 

I’m a big fan of data too, unfortunately Jarman didn’t publish his, but he did specify that he used hospital data. If you’re interested in data on Americans without insurance it was reported to be 27 million in 2018, or around 8.5% of the population (https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-267.html). Many Americans also have only the most basic insurance with high levels of deductibles (they outlawed excessive copays a while ago I believe), and cost is a factor which determines whether or not people even seek treatment. An article from March this year reports that 22% of Americans have skipped healthcare treatment because of costs in the last year alone (https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/03/11/nearly-1-in-4-americans-are-skipping-medical-care-because-of-the-cost.html). In the U.K. they will treat you, and they priorities based on who needs it most, or you can pay for private insurance and get it faster. 

There’s a great many areas where competition is hugely beneficial, but what meaningful competition can you get from an entirely insurance based healthcare system? Health insurance is also prone to adverse selection issues (if you feel a lump on your neck, that’s when you’re most likely to take out comprehensive insurance for cancer treatments...) so you end up paying above and beyond for insurance because insurance companies aren’t allowed to penalise you for a having a preexisting condition, unless you are also advocating for a complete abolition of regulation.",2020-08-23 10:35:08+00:00

I think the 20% tax band should go. It's unbelievably self destructive for the economy out of some dumb notion of fairness. Income tax raises around 25% of government income and of that the lowest paid half of the population pay  10% of that. So 2.5% of government income comes from taxing the poorest 50% of workers.

AskUK,post,nurse,t74j95,SatoshiSounds,Where do you stand on the debate regarding influence of automation on UK industry and workplaces?,"Lots of people in the UK just experienced a tube strike, which led to lots of people crammed on buses, kids missing a week of school, and other factors that led to a stressful week. I've seen and heard a lot of comments like ""good luck to them, but they'll all be automated eventually"".                  
                     
My instinctive, 'big concept' reaction to this is: good, the sooner automation happens, the better.                 
                 
Firstly, machine work will be more efficient and more reliable. Two big ticks there. I've ridden driverless trains, I've experienced the technological precedent (and you can sit at the front and look out the window like a kid up top on a double decker!). I understand that the tube is 150 YO and notoriously hard to update, but it's undeniable that the investment would pay off eventually, no matter the cost - it's only a question of how long that might take.               
                
Secondly, the idea of maintining human input where machine input is more efficient, just to give people something to do, doesn't sit well with me. I think that generally, individuals are capable of far more than the remit of their vocations. Fewer cashiers and machinists, more nurses and teachers and tech experts? That's the world I want to live in!                 
                  
I don't think *all* human inpput should be eliminated *wherever possible*. I understand that some people like interacting with cashiers, and there will always be room for handmade goods etc. so I'm sure the free market will create scope for this kind of human input. But most people in those jobs would be more productive, more stimulated better paid engaging in more complex vocations. So in general I'm very much in favour of large scale, widespread automation.

For a neonatal unit, babies being murdered is pretty much top of the 'severity of harm' chart. Once any accusation like that has been made, the relevant staff need to be out of the clinical environment until a full investigation has occurred.

 If the accusation is found to be malicious, that's a sackable offence on the part of the accuser, but you don't ignore a safeguarding report ever. 

I was a teacher. One of my colleagues was accused by a student of touching them inappropriately.

We knew the kid was a twat, a well known liar and troublemaker. Everyone in the school knew it was almost certainly bullshit and the staff were confident that the teacher would be exonerated. 

The teacher was still suspended while a full investigation was conducted. CCTV showed the kid had been lying, the kid was permanently excluded, and the member of staff reinstated, and that was absolutely the correct way to handle it, because even if there are 999,999 malicious accusers for every 1 real complaint, the procedure needs to be set up to protect the kids from harm as best as possible.",2023-08-22 12:22:05+00:00

Looks like you need to read up a bit on history yourself, squire. Because under the Feudal system, a ""Tithe"" was defined as either 10% of your income, or 10% of your crop yields if you were a farmer. Whichever way you cut it, that's hard to describe as a ""majority"".

It was still grossly unfair, because the ""tithe"" applied to absolutely everyone, regardless of income level. It was the feudal equivalent of the ""flat tax"" that people of a ""Tea Party"" persuasion tend to advocate for today. If you were a relatively well-off freeman of the land (the local blacksmith, for example), then paying 10% of your income to the local Baron or Lord didn't affect your livelihood all that much. But if you were a subsistence farmer, struggling to grow enough to put food on your own table, then having 10% of your crop forcibly taken from you meant that someone in your family was going to go hungry. Most people in those days were subsistence farmers, so it's hardly surprising that everywhere that a feudal system dominated eventually underwent some variety of peasants revolt.",2021-12-31 00:51:47+00:00

AskUK,post,nursing,t74j95,SatoshiSounds,Where do you stand on the debate regarding influence of automation on UK industry and workplaces?,"Lots of people in the UK just experienced a tube strike, which led to lots of people crammed on buses, kids missing a week of school, and other factors that led to a stressful week. I've seen and heard a lot of comments like ""good luck to them, but they'll all be automated eventually"".                  
                     
My instinctive, 'big concept' reaction to this is: good, the sooner automation happens, the better.                 
                 
Firstly, machine work will be more efficient and more reliable. Two big ticks there. I've ridden driverless trains, I've experienced the technological precedent (and you can sit at the front and look out the window like a kid up top on a double decker!). I understand that the tube is 150 YO and notoriously hard to update, but it's undeniable that the investment would pay off eventually, no matter the cost - it's only a question of how long that might take.               
                
Secondly, the idea of maintining human input where machine input is more efficient, just to give people something to do, doesn't sit well with me. I think that generally, individuals are capable of far more than the remit of their vocations. Fewer cashiers and machinists, more nurses and teachers and tech experts? That's the world I want to live in!                 
                  
I don't think *all* human inpput should be eliminated *wherever possible*. I understand that some people like interacting with cashiers, and there will always be room for handmade goods etc. so I'm sure the free market will create scope for this kind of human input. But most people in those jobs would be more productive, more stimulated better paid engaging in more complex vocations. So in general I'm very much in favour of large scale, widespread automation.

We knew the kid was a twat, a well known liar and troublemaker. Everyone in the school knew it was almost certainly bullshit and the staff were confident that the teacher would be exonerated. 

The teacher was still suspended while a full investigation was conducted. CCTV showed the kid had been lying, the kid was permanently excluded, and the member of staff reinstated, and that was absolutely the correct way to handle it, because even if there are 999,999 malicious accusers for every 1 real complaint, the procedure needs to be set up to protect the kids from harm as best as possible.",2023-08-22 12:22:05+00:00

unitedkingdom,comment,nursing,hnkzs9p,Caprylate,,"Hundreds of nurses have called on their regulatory body to withdraw from a diversity scheme run by Stonewall, warning that affiliation with the charity risks harming the reputation of the profession.

Some 460 nurses have written to the Nursing and Midwifery Council demanding that it pulls out of the paid-for scheme, which aims to make workplaces more inclusive for LGBT people.

The charity has been mired in controversy over its gender identity views. It has said people should be able to access single-sex hospital wards based on the gender they identify as.

Several organisations, including the BBC and the Department of Health, have recently withdrawn from the diversity programme over concerns about Stonewall’s position on gender.

The nurses said that they did not support Stonewall’s stance over the medication of children who present with gender dysphoria and its view that patients should be able to access single-sex wards based on their gender identity.

They also highlighted the charity’s behaviour towards those who speak out on gender ideology or challenge its influence, saying that it was vitally important for nurses to speak out for the rights and needs of women patients.

One of the signatories wrote: “I support the needs of trans people — but not to the eradication of women and women’s rights.” Another wrote that they felt unable to protect female patients over fear of being seen as discriminating: “I feel I am unable to protect my female/women patients, and advocate for them without fear of recrimination.”

Eighty-eight per cent of nurses and 99 per cent of midwives are female.

Organised by the campaign group Woman’s Place UK, the letter to the Nursing and Midwifery Council read: “The history of Stonewall to promote equality and safeguard the rights of the LGBT community is one to celebrate.

“However, nursing affiliations must be based on evidence not ideology and judged on current record and strategy, not legacy achievements and reputation.

“We believe that as a profession, there is specific risk to the reputation of nurses and our ability to work within our code from the NMC’s affiliation with Stonewall.”

Andrea Sutcliffe, the NMC’s chief executive, said it knew of the letter and would respond in due course. “We’re aware of Woman’s Place UK’s letter, although it hasn’t been sent to us directly yet,’ she said.

A Stonewall spokesperson said: “This petition is littered with inaccuracies and misinformation. It is disgraceful that these groups continue to misrepresent our diversity champions programme, which simply provides support to organisations to build inclusive workplace environments.

“Ultimately, it is lesbian, gay, bi, trans and queer people who are harmed by these kinds of baseless attacks.”",2021-12-07 11:44:45+00:00

Scotland,comment,patients,jtch3jb,Polstar55555,,"Not a medical receptionist but I do spend a lot of time working with GP practices on the HB side. 

That seems a awful lot of tasks for such a big practice, usually when I encounter practices with >7000 list size they have self check in screens and receptionists are exactly that, they do reception and that's it. Even at smaller practices any admin work usually results in getting cover for reception to let them focus on what they are doing.

Is it A Vision practice? There's sometimes some IT hints and tips that can speed things up e.g. Guidelines that have a button with a Read Code preprogrammed or tasks in day book ready to be assigned to someone, these don't always get passed on but can save a huge amount of time. In our HB Mail Manager should be filing results itself with just the occasional manual input for labs spelling a name incorrectly, there is some setup needed or you constantly get blue headers and have to manually intervene. If you use docman don't forget 'drop a doc'.

I'm curious, who is doing BP's and not entering it in the system themselves? 

Since Covid, a lot of new work has been landing on practice shoulders and it just got absorbed by people so the Practice Manager may not realise they have landed you with so much.

As a GP I definitely prefer seeing my patients in person, I usually only have phone appointments if patients themselves request them (due to work, childcare etc)

But if you couldn’t get an appointment at all - please don’t scapegoat your GP for this. They are also suffering in a wider poor system. Usually if GP’s “refuse” to see you it’s because all the appointments were fully booked by other patients. 

Multiple independent audits have shown that GP surgeries are seeing more patients than what is considered safe. Certainly not sitting there doing nothing and refusing to see people as some people may believe.

 Just because the don’t see YOU doesn’t mean they’re not seeing anyone. The lack of GP capacity makes your GP’s life harder too. It makes it much harder to do their job properly and provide you with good care when you are shouting at them because of a system failure that they’re not even responsible for in the first place.

ukpolitics,comment,patients,jglbjl8,iiibehemothiii,,"It's an interesting one:
We do have long specialist training programmes here, compared to other countries. 

We do have two foundation years in which we rotate around in various depts to get a range of experience (and to see what we'd like to specialise in). I assume your friend is at this point.

Arguments for shortening training include yours above (why am I wasting time on something idc about)

Arguments for keeping it include claiming that a range of experience makes you a better doctor. You might not know what you want to specialise in until you do it (on these rotations). This is actually often the case, in my experience.

The trouble, however, is that a lot of doctors' time is wasted by NHS inefficiencies misusing our skillset. Rather than being trained to improve our experience/skills/take on responsibilities, we are stuck doing paperwork and other non-specialist tasks (I'm simplifying but you get the idea). Cutting this nonsense out could indeed cut a couple of years off the time it takes for a newly qualified doctor into a consultant (currently 10 years for some specialities).  It won't work for everyone and for all specialities, but it's possible.

Unfortunately the NHS prefers longer specialism times for us because it can extract more non-specialist work from us (scribing, doing blood tests) rather than allowing us to do more specialist skills (operating theatre experience, endoscopy, clinics). This is financially better for the NHS as it doesn't have to pay someone else to do blood tests/scribing. The cost is that it is longer/harder to specialise.

The problem is with Physicians Associates scope of practice in that there isn't one. 

Originally they were called physicians assistants with the idea being that they could do the ward jobs like requesting investigations, writing discharges and referrals, cannulation and phlebotomy to allow the doctors to do the more complex jobs they've been trained to do. We now have situations where the PAs are in theatre assisting in surgery whilst the surgical trainees are on the ward writing discharge letters. So currently our trainees are completing their 7 or 8yrs of surgical training and haven't had enough operating time to allow them to take consultant roles, so they all have to go into fellowships to up their numbers.

She used to make them all cry on a weekly basis. My immediate predecessor was also fat and had lodged a formal grievance about weight-based bullying. I wish I’d known about *that* before I applied! 

She’s never made me cry. I’m a trade union rep and I’ve faced bullies who would eat her for breakfast. Both in previous jobs and when I’ve represented others. I’ve calmly asserted myself so many times over the years that she actually claims to be scared of me. 

It’s exhausting spending 7.5 hours a day being braced for an attack. But I keep a log of her behaviour and I have phrases and strategies that work. Unfortunately, she’s quite good at spotting when I’m having a bad day, so that’s when she deployed the infertility stuff. It caught me off guard but I wont let it happen again. 

I’ve been in the job 7 years. She’s old, and in October 2022 she retired. I was thrilled and threw her a party. Then I worked my arse off for six months (doing her manager-job *and* my own job) for no extra money, to “prove myself.” Finally, in April 2023 the opportunity came to apply for the manager job. Imagine my *fucking surprise* when she turned up (suited and booted) for the job interview. And *of course* she got her old job back. Complaints flooded in from colleagues and members of the public but it was too late by then. 

Turns out, her whole retirement was a scam. She’d wanted to go travelling for six months. Senior management had wanted me to ‘hold the fort’ for no extra pay while she was away. Together they’d conspired to give me false hope so she could take an extended holiday.

I consoled myself with the fact that her new contract was only 12 months long. It ended last month. They extended it for another three months. So now I’m waiting til the end of July to see what happens.",2024-05-17 21:57:17+00:00

Almost all of my hospital experiences are positive and I’m lucky to be under a great hospital.

My primary issue which perhaps didn’t come across in my post is these were observations that were due in mid March, the receptionist called to make the appointment on Friday 05.01, appointment is for 09.01 but the receptionist made no mention of these tests need to be done within the next week or there will be no more prescriptions. Having physical disabilities and working full time being told to drop everything for a non urgent appointment has real life consequences- I’m unable to walk to my GP and can’t drive because of my arthritis so also need to arrange taxis. My GP is aware from consultant letters I’ve had IBD and RA consultations in the past week and a routine MRI. 

With blood tests I get a full test from the hospital because of my methotrexate and looking at the GP order it’s exactly the same. My GP has always accepted my hospital bloods for prescriptions related to my physical conditions (I’ve had the hospital forward them 4-5 times) but I’m noting a very different attitude to my psych health. My previous GP actually preferred this because my inflammation markers are always up and it was hard on their system to say that was OK as part of my diagnoses. My hospital also send my most recent bloods to the GP every 6 months in the consultation letter.

The receptionist replied to my cancellation email so they did have it. They’ve also incorrectly put me as a no show previously- including my last bloods and ECG when I was in having my bloods done and got called for my ECG obviously(obviously unaware in the next room) so I was put as a no show and had to rebook and re attend. Although interesting what you’ve said about ICB’s as the GP I have a really negative experience with has shouted at me ‘I am the ICB lead’.

As for ADHD advocacy in addition to my NHS psychiatrist my hospital consultants have also written to my GP to say they have no concerns of my ADHD treatment and my observations have improved since starting treatment. My hospital consultants in particular aren’t happy with my GP as they’ve made some mistakes and made some decisions that have detrimentally affected my health.

I agree most NHS staff are of great calibre and do the best for the NHS. However, GP Partners who are stuck in their ways and don’t consider new research or methods are the exception - and my GP won’t even use econsult or let pharmacies directly request repeat prescriptions",2024-01-17 07:46:00+00:00

This research tries to understand how leaders' behaviour in your organisation can affect your involvement or the enthusiasm you feel about your work, especially when working remotely, like from home or a coffee shop. We know from previous studies that when leaders inspire and motivate their teams (a style known as ""transformational leadership""), it can lead to team members feeling happier, being more productive, and less likely to leave their jobs in a traditional office environment.

Research is being done by PATRYK MAKOWSKI

Current Research ""The relationship between transformational leadership and follower employee work engagement in a remote working environment: A mixed methods investigation.""

It should only take about 10 to 12 minutes to complete. Remember, you can withdraw your participation anytime and don't have to explain why.

Rest assured; no personally identifiable details will be collected or asked for during this survey. All responses will be gathered together in such a way that individual answers cannot be traced back to any one participant. The results will be used for a university thesis and might be presented at academic conferences or even published in a research journal. If you're curious about the results, you can request them, and they might be shared with you or your organisation.

To participate in this study, there are some conditions:

You must be working entirely remotely, which means not working in a traditional office setting at all (no 'hybrid' work).

You should have worked remotely with the same employer for at least SIX MONTHS..

You need to be employed by a PRIVATE-sector organisation.

Your employer should be located in Ireland or the UK.

You should be at least 18 years old.

The study is open to remote workers from all levels of the organisation, regardless of your role or position. Whether you're a new hire or a senior executive, you are welcome to participate.

Almost all of my hospital experiences are positive and I’m lucky to be under a great hospital.

My primary issue which perhaps didn’t come across in my post is these were observations that were due in mid March, the receptionist called to make the appointment on Friday 05.01, appointment is for 09.01 but the receptionist made no mention of these tests need to be done within the next week or there will be no more prescriptions. Having physical disabilities and working full time being told to drop everything for a non urgent appointment has real life consequences- I’m unable to walk to my GP and can’t drive because of my arthritis so also need to arrange taxis. My GP is aware from consultant letters I’ve had IBD and RA consultations in the past week and a routine MRI. 

With blood tests I get a full test from the hospital because of my methotrexate and looking at the GP order it’s exactly the same. My GP has always accepted my hospital bloods for prescriptions related to my physical conditions (I’ve had the hospital forward them 4-5 times) but I’m noting a very different attitude to my psych health. My previous GP actually preferred this because my inflammation markers are always up and it was hard on their system to say that was OK as part of my diagnoses. My hospital also send my most recent bloods to the GP every 6 months in the consultation letter.

The receptionist replied to my cancellation email so they did have it. They’ve also incorrectly put me as a no show previously- including my last bloods and ECG when I was in having my bloods done and got called for my ECG obviously(obviously unaware in the next room) so I was put as a no show and had to rebook and re attend. Although interesting what you’ve said about ICB’s as the GP I have a really negative experience with has shouted at me ‘I am the ICB lead’.

As for ADHD advocacy in addition to my NHS psychiatrist my hospital consultants have also written to my GP to say they have no concerns of my ADHD treatment and my observations have improved since starting treatment. My hospital consultants in particular aren’t happy with my GP as they’ve made some mistakes and made some decisions that have detrimentally affected my health.

I agree most NHS staff are of great calibre and do the best for the NHS. However, GP Partners who are stuck in their ways and don’t consider new research or methods are the exception - and my GP won’t even use econsult or let pharmacies directly request repeat prescriptions",2024-01-17 07:46:00+00:00

ukpolitics,comment,privatization,jmldc0w,spiral8888,,"So, what exactly should the government do about housing the asylum seekers? You are clearly against putting them in hotels. Fine. Someone above recommended building a refugee camp for them and got huge criticism for that. Then what is the solution? 

And the answer can't be ""process them faster"" as I'm sure any government on this planet would choose to do exactly that if it were that simple. In most cases, it is not trivial to verify if the heartbreaking story that the asylum seeker tells is true. And if you just go with the #metoo philosophy and believe whatever they tell, then every asylum seeker will be given a story to learn by heart in Calais and that will get them through the process. So, you're left with the arduous job to try to piece together what really is the truth with each and every asylum seeker. With some (like the Ukrainians) it can be easy as you know that their country is at war and missiles killing civilians get launched to pretty much everywhere in the country, but with people coming from regions where there is no open war going on, it's not so simple. 

What pisses me off in the political discourse on asylum seekers is that everyone thinks that there are easy solutions but the government just on purpose refuses to do them. Having watched this same thing in several countries over a couple of decades, I'm pretty sure that no such easy solutions exist. Or maybe with one exception, namely what Hungary is doing, which is to say no to pretty much everyone without caring the consequences.

>If the government uses it's borrowing power to provide efficient rents no private entity could compete

I would agree with you that the public sector can borrow at lower cost than private individuals (Councils use the PWLB) - that is not a contentious point between us.  However. I am not sure how that is relevant to the point I was making. The point I was making is that without a legislative impediment, there is nothing to stop that re-investment. Whether or not it would be sensible to reinvest in property, or profitable, is quite a different issue. A private landlord  'bought out' under the proposal might want to reinvest in rental property and, if there  was 'competition' from a public sector body they could either choose a different market segment where there was no competition (e.g. holiday lets, upmarket housing stock) or work on the basis that there would be excess demand so a 'profit' was still obtainable. They may even think that a low rate of return (even negative) was satisfactory if the investment protected their capital. This is why I see the creation of that legislative impediment as  a key (unwritten) element of the proposal with all the negative implications that would go with it.

>I don't have the freedom to find a 1BR flat that doesn't take 50% of  my salary. I'm not interested in the unlimited freedom of rich people.

I think that's a misuse of the word 'freedom'.  The absence of a cheap rental (relative to salary) is not an infringement of your freedom (i.e. that the world is not a certain way) whereas a legal restriction preventing you doing something is (right or wrong). The point being made is also not about the unlimited freedom of rich people, it is about the freedom of individuals to rent out their property (and property rights form part of the ECHR). Use of the term 'rich' does not help as it tends to be emotive and ill-defined/relative. I would not see many private landlords as 'rich' - unless they also have a yacht and private island :-) but you may see them as 'rich' simply as they own one or more properties. To go back to my example, I have known teachers take teaching contracts abroad and rent out their homes in the UK - that does not mean they are 'rich'.

>It would not be difficult to provide caveats to people temporarily away  from their properties.  Acting like this is complicated in the era of  modern technology is either silly or disingenuous

I think the confusion is yours in thinking technology relevant. As noted, a proposal like this would require primary legislation. When talking about legislation the provision of caveats and exceptions is difficult and that has nothing to do with the ""era of modern technology"". It is a matter of parliamentary drafting and handling exceptions.

>This is a vacuous statement. You have no data.

It's based on my experience working in the social housing sector and in regeneration. But you're right - I didn't provide data although it is realtively easy to find the buisness plans/strategic plans of housing associations and Councils to see the thinking (and reasoning).

>The bad logic continues. Renters are generally lower-income working class. .*.\[edited\]*.. These workers spend every pound they earn so that money would immediately flow into the economy

You seem to misunderstand the point (and the logic). If a landlord is paying 20% tax on their rental income then that goes straight to the treasury. If rents are reduced through the proposal and the  'profit' element is removed then that money does not go to the treasury and the tenant gets a lower rent. Therefore there is an effective transfer (albeit indirect) from the treasury to the tenant. You appear to be making a quite separate point (which may be a valid counter argument - but that does not mean my logic is faulty). The separate point you appear to be making is that 'working class' people spend every penny they get so the 'transfer from the treasury to the tenant' in my point will be offset by the tax on the spending - presumably alcohol and cigarettes plus VAT! :-). It is a valid point for you to make but it does involve some curious assumptions about peoples behaviour based on class :-) .

>Only someone with a vested in the current corrupt system such overwhelming flaws as advantages

I enjoyed and appreciated your response except I felt this last comment was unhelpful. That someone takes a different view to you does not mean they are X or Y it simply means they have a different viewpoint and we all learn by sharing our different perspectives. In this case my comments were directed at the OP which I thought was entertaining but impractical if not undesirable. That does not mean I do not think there are problems with the housing market which is, in my view, highly distorted and dysfunctional. If I were to make similar assumptions about you then based on your comments about working class spending habits (certainly not evident on the Council estate where I was brought up) I would guess you are both under 30 and middles class (and probably studying at Manchester Met). But I'm just as likely as you to be wrong! :-)

Thank you for taking the time to respond to my original comment.

Almost all of my hospital experiences are positive and I’m lucky to be under a great hospital.

My primary issue which perhaps didn’t come across in my post is these were observations that were due in mid March, the receptionist called to make the appointment on Friday 05.01, appointment is for 09.01 but the receptionist made no mention of these tests need to be done within the next week or there will be no more prescriptions. Having physical disabilities and working full time being told to drop everything for a non urgent appointment has real life consequences- I’m unable to walk to my GP and can’t drive because of my arthritis so also need to arrange taxis. My GP is aware from consultant letters I’ve had IBD and RA consultations in the past week and a routine MRI. 

With blood tests I get a full test from the hospital because of my methotrexate and looking at the GP order it’s exactly the same. My GP has always accepted my hospital bloods for prescriptions related to my physical conditions (I’ve had the hospital forward them 4-5 times) but I’m noting a very different attitude to my psych health. My previous GP actually preferred this because my inflammation markers are always up and it was hard on their system to say that was OK as part of my diagnoses. My hospital also send my most recent bloods to the GP every 6 months in the consultation letter.

The receptionist replied to my cancellation email so they did have it. They’ve also incorrectly put me as a no show previously- including my last bloods and ECG when I was in having my bloods done and got called for my ECG obviously(obviously unaware in the next room) so I was put as a no show and had to rebook and re attend. Although interesting what you’ve said about ICB’s as the GP I have a really negative experience with has shouted at me ‘I am the ICB lead’.

As for ADHD advocacy in addition to my NHS psychiatrist my hospital consultants have also written to my GP to say they have no concerns of my ADHD treatment and my observations have improved since starting treatment. My hospital consultants in particular aren’t happy with my GP as they’ve made some mistakes and made some decisions that have detrimentally affected my health.

I agree most NHS staff are of great calibre and do the best for the NHS. However, GP Partners who are stuck in their ways and don’t consider new research or methods are the exception - and my GP won’t even use econsult or let pharmacies directly request repeat prescriptions",2024-01-17 07:46:00+00:00

unitedkingdom,post,privatize,wyzyz5,JacobRiley,"We need to consider radical change to help with the cost of living - Food, free at the point of use.","We need Food, Shelter, Energy, Water, Education and Care (in its many forms). This is a basic threshold we should not even debate. Beyond that we need opportunities to grow, to self-actualise and do things that bring us joy.

I want to generate a grand plan that envisages a society where all of these requirements are free at the point of use. We have the shining global example of this in the NHS, and until recently in our education systems. Our safety, through policing, the fire services, the army are also free at point of use. As is the countries fundamental infrastructures.

In our current state of crisis we also have continuous discussions around taking back public control of our energy and water sectors.

But I want to start with the first fundamental. Food.

Food (along with water) is our most fundamental need. The revolutions in farming that allowed fewer hands to feed many led to us having leisure time, which in turn led to us having the mental capacity to want to drive the world forward. And to many of us it is considered a solved problem. But the latest reports suggest 1 in 10 people in the UK live in food poverty. That is 1 in 10 people cannot afford to eat in a way considered nutritionally appropriate. We all have heard that food banks are used in numbers never before seen and many attendees are people in jobs that are considering respectable and needed by society.

So **let us discuss making food free at the point of use**.

**Food**

In my family of two we spend around 100 pounds a week on food. This is a decadence. Five years ago I had 100 euros a month spare after I had paid my rent (which included utilities), 10 euros would go on my phone bill, and I would then scrounge as best I could to give myself around 40 euros a week to feed myself and keep my 90 euros disposable income disposable. I ate OK. Hunger could be satiated even on this minimal income.

My thesis here is that it does not cost a great deal to feed someone. Food Poverty occurs because competing pressures mean that the small amount of money required to eat OK is not available, or (and I do not believe this happens in any significant numbers) some people spend frivolously and buy large new TVs rather than feed them and theirs.

So **I propose a card, that every adult in the country may have that gives them £50 a week for food. With a £30 top up for each child.**

There are around 55 million adults, and 14 million under eighteens in the UK. These are important figures. With a significant cost burden to feed.

In total this idea of a card that makes food free at the point of use **costs £143 Billion pounds a year to feed the adults, with a further £22 Billion pounds a year to feed our children**.

These are figures that seem unreasonably large but allow me to put them into context.

The **UKs tax income in the tax year 21-22 was £718 Billion**. In 2011-2012 this income was £454 Billion.

That is **a growth of £264 Billion in the last decade**. This is more than inflation. **This is extra money the government has to drive progress. This is enough money to make food free at the point of use.**

More realistically the country needs to find around 20% more tax income to feed its nation free at the point of use. This doesn’t take into account that not everyone will use their allowance, the intent is not that someone can build up credit. It doesn't take into account that this would be a national trial that can adjust the money given each week downwards if we are seeing 'waste'.

I'm not going to try and discuss increased taxation here, though i'm a fan of increasing the higher rate from 40% as a starter.

First lets discuss some of the obvious questions:

**Won’t people just buy steak and cake?**

This system works because we are covering peoples needs. It works because supermarkets would have regulations on what can be sold through the card. I envisage a clear section of a food shop that contains fruit, vegetables, poultry, fish, flour, grains, eggs, milk, beans and other staples. Incredible food can be created from this, and people are of course welcome to spend their own money on any ‘luxury’ foods that they wish to supplement their shop with. Which leads us to the next obvious question.

**Won’t shops simply raise the prices of these foods?**

Hopefully the prices should drop. It would be a requirement that these foods are sold at cost, or minimal return. We can take advantage of the private sector here. If all supermarkets have these sections they are competing for you to go and spend your card money at their supermarkets. This means incentives to shop with them. Incentives like if you spend your £50 with us this week we will give you a free box of chocolates. Incentives like if you spend your £30 with us we will give you a free pack of nappies. The largest goal of a shop is to get you inside and this system works because we have a large amount of companies competing for your custom already.

**Then won’t the suppliers raise prices?**

The supply chain shouldn’t be affected. If one supermarket begins to pay suppliers more then the cost of their section will go up. We will keep the tiered system of an expensive Waitrose shop and a cheap Farmfoods shop. Many of us know £50 will get us less in Marks and Spencers than Lidl. It is an individuals choice how much they need to supplement this ‘free’ food.

**Won’t the system be ripe for fraud?**

In a system where you receive £50 a week, that does not accrue with underspend, and that will procure you only things available to everyone else in the country then what reason is there to make the effort to create false identities, or steal others cards when at best it will acquire you £50 of eggs. These are not high value items that can be sold on for profit. These are in many cases items with a short shelf life not worth stealing and selling to other countries. Of course fraud will occur but by its nature it should not be worth the effort and risk for 99.999% of people to partake in such activities.

**What would these cards look like, what if I lose mine?**

We already have systems in place that give us unique identifiers, with cash associated, that are easily blocked or cancelled and replaced with our bank cards. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel here. Much of this manifesto will discuss how we either have technology in place that allows for the betterment of society or that this technology is coming and we must plan for it.

There are of course other questions but I believe these are the obvious ones.

Now let us revisit the issue of cost. At £165 billion pounds a year this is equivalent to paying for the NHS again every year. But it is only a little more than half of current spend (£300 Billion) on ‘social protection’. Pensions do not need to cost us £111 Billion if food is free. £30 a week bonus for children could be taken somewhat from the existing £46 Billion yearly spend on family benefits.

Now I don't actually think any of these benefits should reduce. I think tax should increase at the higher rates.

But this is just something i've been thinking about for a while, and finally tried to do some of the math on.

Hopefully it's interesting and people will want to discuss it.",2022-08-27T10:55:05+00:00

Brexit and Trump represent temper tantrums by old powers way past their prime. 

Instead of showing a clear vision for the future both realistic and costed so actually feasible, they look to the past and the “good old days” when they were truly dominant powers.

Trump talks about gas and oil as great industries, even though the oil age has ended. The UK is talking about gas fracking still and Scotland talks about the oil industry revenues endlessly.

Now consider other nations. Japan, SK even India. All of them are developing renewable energy. Go take a flight over the Siberia corridor flight path and you can see the gigantic solar farms.

Both the UK and US have rejected science in the formulation of policy. 

In the US, Christian Zionist groups which reject evolution have a strong role in the Trump administration and the formulation of policy. None of these policies are costed or thought out. Trump for instance on his infrastructure bill. He just said it will be great trust me. When asked how he stormed out.

In the UK charlatans who are no better than religious types peddle fantasy. There are similarities again when people ask a terrible question of HOW? They shout meaningless slogans or threaten to kill you.

Almost all of my hospital experiences are positive and I’m lucky to be under a great hospital.

My primary issue which perhaps didn’t come across in my post is these were observations that were due in mid March, the receptionist called to make the appointment on Friday 05.01, appointment is for 09.01 but the receptionist made no mention of these tests need to be done within the next week or there will be no more prescriptions. Having physical disabilities and working full time being told to drop everything for a non urgent appointment has real life consequences- I’m unable to walk to my GP and can’t drive because of my arthritis so also need to arrange taxis. My GP is aware from consultant letters I’ve had IBD and RA consultations in the past week and a routine MRI. 

With blood tests I get a full test from the hospital because of my methotrexate and looking at the GP order it’s exactly the same. My GP has always accepted my hospital bloods for prescriptions related to my physical conditions (I’ve had the hospital forward them 4-5 times) but I’m noting a very different attitude to my psych health. My previous GP actually preferred this because my inflammation markers are always up and it was hard on their system to say that was OK as part of my diagnoses. My hospital also send my most recent bloods to the GP every 6 months in the consultation letter.

The receptionist replied to my cancellation email so they did have it. They’ve also incorrectly put me as a no show previously- including my last bloods and ECG when I was in having my bloods done and got called for my ECG obviously(obviously unaware in the next room) so I was put as a no show and had to rebook and re attend. Although interesting what you’ve said about ICB’s as the GP I have a really negative experience with has shouted at me ‘I am the ICB lead’.

As for ADHD advocacy in addition to my NHS psychiatrist my hospital consultants have also written to my GP to say they have no concerns of my ADHD treatment and my observations have improved since starting treatment. My hospital consultants in particular aren’t happy with my GP as they’ve made some mistakes and made some decisions that have detrimentally affected my health.

I agree most NHS staff are of great calibre and do the best for the NHS. However, GP Partners who are stuck in their ways and don’t consider new research or methods are the exception - and my GP won’t even use econsult or let pharmacies directly request repeat prescriptions",2024-01-17 07:46:00+00:00

This research tries to understand how leaders' behaviour in your organisation can affect your involvement or the enthusiasm you feel about your work, especially when working remotely, like from home or a coffee shop. We know from previous studies that when leaders inspire and motivate their teams (a style known as ""transformational leadership""), it can lead to team members feeling happier, being more productive, and less likely to leave their jobs in a traditional office environment.

Research is being done by PATRYK MAKOWSKI

Current Research ""The relationship between transformational leadership and follower employee work engagement in a remote working environment: A mixed methods investigation.""

It should only take about 10 to 12 minutes to complete. Remember, you can withdraw your participation anytime and don't have to explain why.

Rest assured; no personally identifiable details will be collected or asked for during this survey. All responses will be gathered together in such a way that individual answers cannot be traced back to any one participant. The results will be used for a university thesis and might be presented at academic conferences or even published in a research journal. If you're curious about the results, you can request them, and they might be shared with you or your organisation.

To participate in this study, there are some conditions:

You must be working entirely remotely, which means not working in a traditional office setting at all (no 'hybrid' work).

You should have worked remotely with the same employer for at least SIX MONTHS..

You need to be employed by a PRIVATE-sector organisation.

Your employer should be located in Ireland or the UK.

You should be at least 18 years old.

The study is open to remote workers from all levels of the organisation, regardless of your role or position. Whether you're a new hire or a senior executive, you are welcome to participate.

See, the problem with trying to woo the parents that can't afford private school anymore is that Labour is proposing to make private schools more expensive, by removing their tax breaks.

Putting aside whether this is the right policy or not for a minute, I can't help feeling that the people that Labour have *just* priced out of getting their children into the school that they wanted them to go to aren't necessarily going to be receptive to being wooed.

However, unfortunately I have to move on at a really awkward moment and am desperately looking out there for someone who might like to take my place!

The kids (aged 4 - 12) are great, and the facilitator part is pretty simple... you just have to set up an activity and let em go at it! 

This would really suit a student, hopeful teacher or other caregiver, or someone who loves drama equally. There's a lot of autonomy in the roll, and plenty of guidance and training too - so no experience is needed.

ukpolitics,post,subsidy,5obpfr,Findex,"Why is the economic policy of the British Government considered ""Neoliberal""?","Why is the economic policy of the British Government considered ""Neoliberal"" as many people both in this subreddit and in the media suggest?

Neoliberalism is definied by Investopedia as ""Neoliberalism is a policy model of social studies and economics that transfers control of economic factors to the private sector from the public sector.""^1 or basically, the privatisation of industry and the non-intervention of the state in the economy. 

Lets look at the British economy since 1980, the point at which many would argue that neoliberalism became the dominant economic view within the UK. Raw Government expenditure has risen enormously, whilst as a % of GDP it has fallen only very marginally.^2 Whilst successive British governments since 1980 have provided increased economic controls, micromanagement and subsidies to business and services as demonstrated by a 2015 Treasury report.^3 These subsidies are at the expense of both the taxpayer and unsubsidised taxpaying businesses. Other sectors lose out due to government subsidies as by giving government support to a specific sector of business, private investment is therefore encouraged in that sector given it's relative safety, as a result depriving unsubsidied sectors of business. Since 1980, social spending has also exploded, with Healthcare (NHS) spending seeing a consistant rise.

This data points to the conclusion that successive British governments are engaged in economic planning and funnelling public funds into sectors of business which it deems part of the national interest to do so. So whilst key industries may have been privatised since 1980, the government has subsequently started micromanaging the economy in other ways. 

The British government is therefore not Neoliberal, it is a consumerist mixed economy where Capitalism and State controls are both employed. If the government were Neoliberal surely it would seek to cease all economic control of the economy instead of attempting to manipulate it to the advantage of the state?

europe,comment,surgeon,d4t9n6p,nikolaz72,,"Being a fellow Federalist I think I'm in a good position to argue with you on this point from another perspective.

As a member of a political youth group I'm going to remind people that we are humans and starting off by calling us indoctrinated is a very poor way to begin a discussion.

Political youth groups are a way not only to socialize with likeminded individuals interested in politics but to gain experience in politics and a wide area of subjects without being a politician, to act like we're less qualified, more disconnected with the public or even indoctrinated than someone straight out of the working class is absurd. To say we're -straight out of indoctrination- is at the very least mean spirited in its wording considering the very people you're talking about often have widely different opinions on a great number of subjects even within their own party (As shown in the U.K).

I've attended meetings by farmers, butchers, fishermen, ex-soldiers (Yugoslavia, Afghanistan) and ofc the odd meeting from a politician to discuss their experience with matters we may or may not experience ourselves in the future. 

We get to travel, meet people from not just other parties from within the countries but also in Germany, France, U.K to talk with the people of countries we might be doing business with in the future, networking, learn about their politics. 

And its not like politicians coming out of the working classes with no political background are always success stories, they sometimes end up in communist or nationalist and populist parties pushing the kind of politics that'd doom a nation were they implemented, stuff like Brexit. Because while they aren't in a political youth group its not like they don't still have their own political preferences and with the internet it is more possible than ever to find echo chambers of people that agree with your view however fringe it might be. And even before that you could just read one very biased tabloid for your news every week and get your opinions from that, no need for a political group 'indoctrinating' you.

I do see where you're coming from (And think we do have too many politicians with a background in political sciences) but at the same time I think you're being unfair in your brief and inaccurate representation of political youth groups, its not even a majority of us who take political sciences...

northernireland,comment,surgery,hb8xujs,Lotsofnots,,"I worked at GP surgeries for a couple of years. Imagine working retail, but people really want to buy things, and you are under specific instructions to not let them. 

The practice managers and GPs are largely financially driven. Some absolutely care, some are psychotic egomaniacs. 

GPs are often worn down by dealing with time wasters and the futility of trying to promote healthy living to overweight, smoking, drinking, self-diagnosing hypochondriacs. That mixed with people who genuinely need their help, but referring them, prescribing meds, any treatment, costs their business money. Couple that with the infinite politics of healthcare funding, contracts, qof targets etc. It's shite. 

Most patients are polite and courteous, but, let's face it, mostly you are interacting on not a good day. You forgot to put your prescription in on time, your kid is screaming bloody murder, you have been putting off getting that lump checked for 3 months because you are scared of the potential. We get it. But we also get a decent proportion of entitled, angry, rude and offensive people demanding we sort things for them.

Now be the meat in that sandwich. You want to speak to a GP? I put a call through and they scream at me. I remind them to sign the prescription stack I printed (and slipped yours in with a note, yes I tried) and get the stack thrown at me. I try to catch them in between patients to let them know you are having a crisis and threatening self harm if they don't see you, I get an eye roll and told you are always threatening to get your own way. Genuine examples here btw. I get paid living wage while a locum gp is paid £150 an hour. Yes an hour. We see the invoices. Oh and my favourite, having meetings and reading all the complaints about the receptionists, but none about the GPs or other staff. We knew there were complaints, we heard them and handed patients a pen and paper. 

Receptionists are stuck between swearing and emotional blackmail from patients and screaming, egomaniac employers all while paid a pitiful wage and having absolutely no ability to actually help 90% of the time because of the restrictions and rules they face by GPs, the manager and just the situation of healthcare. I know they should be understanding, but in my experience, most became hardened old dragons that treated the doctor's like old testament gods and the patients like an inconvenience.

This shouldn't cost this much, provided you spread the costs over several meals. Eg. a bag of 10 potatoes is £1, so really 20p per portion. And broccoli is usually more like 50p for 2 meals worth. Then if you buy a whole chicken for say £5, and roast it. Then you have 2 legs, 2 wings, 2 breasts, probably enough leftovers to make a sandwich, and bones to make stock with.

It cost me £4k, and while I could probably have gotten it done a lot cheaper if I wanted to, I felt better getting it done here.

Laser eye surgery isn't exactly a new procedure, so it's not likely you'll get a doctor who has never done it before, and it's pretty much all automated anyway, so the computers should be able to take care of it all - it's quite probable that you'd be fine having it done overseas.

However, any small mistake and your sight could be irreparably damaged for the rest of your life. Do you really want to be looking around for the lowest bidder on something so important?

In the past and many people would say it shows they like me and need me and it's an honour to be thought of like that.

europe,comment,ward,ckqktl6,H0agh,,"Well, I think we sort of felt betrayed by your banks like Goldman Sachs, betting hardcore on a European default and breakup in 2012, so we are somewhat defensive there. We also feel like a big part of the mess we are in is to blame on the Anglo-Saxon banking model with derivatives and swap packages containing many of your subprime mortgages pushed upon our banks in the past. Which is of course bullshit. We were just as complicit in this, and Deutsche Bank is one of the most overleveraged banks in the world right now.

On top of that there is also the feeling of America as the new imperialistic power and us being falsely lured into the Iraq war in the Bush days. 

Let´s just say there is a lot of misunderstanding about eachother on both sides of the Ocean.

That being said I still stand by my points of not liking the idea of just printing money and adding up debt for future generations, I think we all need to learn to live within our means and actually work on lowering the debt to gdp ratio like we agreed on entering the EU.

Btw, I appreciate you answering calmly and us having a proper discourse instead of a shouting match, which often happens on the internet and kind of annoyed me about other US posters, even though my comments were probably inflamatory as well from a US perspective so I will take that into account next time I post.

I do think we should learn some serious lessons from the past crisis, and I don´t think we can just turn on the printing presses and continue on the same course. We need some serious regulation of the financial sector, I´m not opposed to a Trading tax to curb the excesses of High Frequency Trading and I think we need to jail bankers just like we jail regular folks who don´t abide by the law.

But Queens (and Oldchurch, Queens' predecessor) were abysmal with how my step-nana was treated. She had to go in THREE TIMES during her stint with a hernia. The first to get it removed. The second because they fucked up the first time. And the third because she still wasn't recovering...because she caught MRSA when on the ward. Six long months of pain and agony for her which ended within six weeks of her going private.

Not to mention when Oldchurch transferred their records to Queens they lost both my brother's medical records (noting he'd suffered from bells palsy) And my old friend's medical records too (which is important because she has three kidneys, all of which are fucked.) Like. How can a hospital be so incompetent? 

So now there is no official record of my brother ever having BP, like at all, which is probably an important thing to have a record of. As for my old friend, we no longer talk, but I hope that they sorted it out all thay time ago. Considering Old church took over 12 years of her life to work out she had 3 kidneys and that was causing all her issues just speaks for itself with how shitty that place was. Glad it got ripped down and turned into housing.

Ward granted derogation at the 11th hour based on inflated numbers, some lies, and some creative interpretation of safe staffing levels. Essentially using the very nature of the strike to undermine our right to strike at all.","yesterday. We are exempt (banned) from striking. We should never have told them of our intent to strike at all but we didn’t know any better when they were asking us weeks ago. 

When we were handed a document explaining the justification for this decision it was immediately clear that the state of the ward has been grossly misrepresented, with many numbers being out of date, some plainly inaccurate, and some usefully vague language about risk, all working together to make a case that our normal and safe minimum staffing levels are higher than they are 99% of the time. We feel cheated. 

I’ve already reported it to the union and will hopefully have a response this morning. 

They have said we’re full when we’re not, said we have more increased observations and 1-1’s (mental health inpatients) than we actually have, and have led the union to believe that our participation in the strike would be too risky, even though he ward is the best it’s been all year.

Some of the figures about the patients were accurate two weeks ago, but we’re provably not true when the application for derogation went in on the 8th.

They have been misinforming staff for the past fortnight about the strikes, telling various people they’re not allowed to strike, asking people of their intent to strike (which some of the decent ones later told us we should never have been asked), and generally trying to cast doubt in everyone’s mind about their rights and how this is gonna go down.

They have convinced the union that anything less than 2 qualified and 4 hca would be drastically unacceptable. The qualifieds I spoke to yesterday were laughing through their tears because I they are constantly working on their own. No one could quite believe what we were reading. The ward is the best it’s been in months. We worked 1 and 3 yesterday and we have been for weeks. The thing that gets us the most is that even during the spring and summer when the ward was the most challenging it’s been in years, most of the time we struggled on with 1 and 3 anyway. I’ve worked on these wards 15 years and I’ve never seen it so unsafe as it was then. Even the managements current exercise in creative writing and number fudging is nothing on the actual state of the place earlier this year. They didn’t seem to want to know then, so we are infuriated and sickened to see how much of an interest they’ve taken in the last week now that it suits them.

europe,post,welfare,3qjrat,majezon,A Polish person's opinion about the western media's ridiculous claims about the winning party of the recent elections,"I'm a Pole living in Poland. During the recent elections the Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (Law and Justice) party has won the election. I was rather happy with the result even though it wasn't the party I voted for. Namely because the Platforma Obywatelska (Citizen's Platform) no longer is in charge. 

I would like to explain how stupid and not related to reality the claims of nationalism and such are for the winning party.

1. PIS (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość/Law and Justice) is NOT a nationalist nor even a right wing party - PIS is a center party best described as a social democratic party that values patriotic and Catholic traits.

2. PIS is not an orthodox Catholic party. It is the party officially supported by the Polish Catholic environments (for example Radio Maryja - the Catholic radio).

3. PIS has already ruled for a brief time and didn't do anything revolutionary that would count as an act of xenophobia or orthodoxy leading to persecution of minority or gays.

4. PIS has never attacked homosexuals nor did they oppose to accepting the Syrian migrants. Their opposition is towards the way the European Union handles it.

5. The irony is that in Poland PIS is viewed as a leftist party by the nationalist and far right wing parties and voters. Why? Because PIS focuses on social welfare benefits and is a social democratic party according to the people calling themselves the ""rightful right wing"".

So, why is PIS getting attacks from the western countries? The president of the European Union, Donald Tusk is also the leader of the Platforma Obywatelska party, that opposes PIS. Platforma Obywatelska didn't oppose any European Union policy, while PIS has a very different view point from PO and the EU itself. That is why many western countries and their media are very ignorant in the matter of what PIS actually represents and possibly finds it the enemy of EU policies.

Since PIS opposes Tusk's party, perhaps this is why there is a common misconception about thinking that PIS would oppose the EU policies. It does not. I suggest you wait until they ACTUALLY DO the things your wild imagination tells you to spew like they were facts, before putting them out in public, attacking the party that hasn't even started running out government after this year's elections. ;)

I would also like to remind you that they have won by democratic election, and any attempt at criticizing the fact that they are going to run the country is insulting the people who have elected them just as much.",2015-10-28 11:45:38+00:00
