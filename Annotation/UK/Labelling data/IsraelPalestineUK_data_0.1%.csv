Remembering Palestinian dead is not anti-Semitic, Corbyn has also been present in many Jewish ceremonies too. 

Regarding the mural, Corbyn simply responded to a post by an artist  who wondered why his mural was removed by saying that has happened to many great artists. He did not defend or reference the mural. Calling it anti-Semitic is also rather dubious, it depicts 5 famous American banking families, two of which are Jewish. People mention hooked noses but they look no different to the other gentlemen in the mural. 

We don't need to make it into a who is more racist competition but Johnson has done many other things which could be construed as racist.

But one night the intense Israeli bombing campaign left their house in ruins. “Miraculously, we escaped death and sought refuge in our neighbours’ house,” she said. At 6am the next morning, Nahla and her four children began the slow walk south.

Israel’s war has split the territory of 2.3 million people in two, with the military telling Palestinians to move below the Gaza river to what it calls “safe zones”. Still, it has continued to bomb the entire strip, wiping out families it says are unfortunate causalities in its targeting of militants.

To get people to move, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have often advertised what they call “humanitarian corridors” along the Salah al-Din Road for four hours a day, which they say is to help civilians to flee. UN rights experts warn, however, that demands for civilians to leave while under bombardment, and with no guarantee of safe return, amount to a forcible population transfer, which is a crime against humanity.

Speaking from the al-Maghazi camp in the central Gaza Strip, Nahla described walking past Israeli soldiers, holding up rags of white clothing in the hope they would not be shot. “We were thousands of people, with children crying, women screaming, and many disabled people who could not walk,” she said.

One of her daughters, Yara, 16, said soldiers were pointing their guns straight at them. “I saw Israeli tanks for the first time in my life on the ground.” The soldiers told people to raise their hands and hold up their identity documents, which would be inspected at a checkpoint.

At one point, Yara’s ID card fell out of her hand. “I bent down to pick it up, and the Israeli soldiers started shooting at my feet. They told me that I was prohibited from picking up anything on the ground.”

Young Palestinian men were singled out from the crowds. Israeli soldiers told them to line up, calling them out using a megaphone, and then detaining and stripping them naked.

Now living in an abandoned school, the small family are getting cold as winter sets in. They had slept in a tent in the schoolyard, but moved into the corridor once the rain started. “There is no room for us in the classroom,” said Nahla. “My two daughters, Yara and Asmaa, are trembling with fear to this day. They refuse to sleep except next to me.”

In the same building, 15-year-old Saja sits beside her injured mother on a worn-out mattress. She made the journey south after being bombed out twice in northern Gaza.

The family of six had lived in the Jabalia refugee camp for the past two decades. “We are a peace-loving family that cherishes life,” said Saja.

The IDF called her father one day on his phone, telling him their home would be a target. They then moved to her grandfather’s place, but a strike on a neighbour left shrapnel in her mother’s leg.

They moved to the Indonesian hospital but it too came under heavy bombardment. “Entire neighbourhoods in Jabalia camp were obliterated,” said Saja. “When we decided to evacuate we joined hundreds of Palestinians … moving in groups, pushing wheelchairs carrying my mother and sister. With us, we only had a minimal supply of canned food and our identification documents.

“Upon reaching Salah al-Din street, we encountered tanks and occupation soldiers who shouted at us. Some even laughed.

“We were not allowed to deviate from the prescribed path, constantly holding up our IDs with our right hands,” she added. “As we walked past a soldier, we moved slowly due to my mother and sister’s critical condition. The soldier shouted at us: ‘Run quickly.’”

Eventually, they crossed the river, and paid for a donkey cart to take them to Bureij camp. “Our initial attempt to seek shelter at the [UN] school there was met with refusal.” They boarded another donkey cart and headed to Maghazi camp.

“Upon our arrival, a compassionate displaced woman took pity on our situation and provided a mattress for my injured mother,” said Saja.

Sitting beside her, her leg wrapped with metal poking out of it, Saja’s mother, Maha, spoke in a weak voice: “Here, there are no necessities for life – no food, no treatment, no healthcare, nothing humane,” she said. The days, she said, “resembles life in a forest, where we fight even for water”.

Israel’s offensive, launched in the wake of Hamas’s 7 October attack that killed 1,200 people, has killed more than 14,000 people, and thousands are still missing. A four-day ceasefire that begun on Friday has allowed more aid to reach Palestinians struggling to survive with shortages of water and other essentials. Aid has also reached northern Gaza for the first time in a month.

Aya Hammad, 23, was at home in the Sabra area of Gaza City in early November when her father and two sisters received calls from the IDF, instructing them to evacuate.

“We didn’t have the luxury of contemplating the supplies we might need,” she added. “We carried only our identity documents and a small bag containing a single piece of clothing to mitigate the harshness of the impending winter cold.”

Once across the Gaza river, her family found shelter in the abandoned house of a friend in the southern city of Khan Younis. “The temporary refuge we currently occupy resembles a ghost town, devoid of any human presence,” she said.

“There is no electricity, no internet, no water, and no food. Our neighbours provide us with a small amount of water to prevent us from dying of thirst.”",2023-11-26T15:45:39+00:00

LabourUK,comment,ceasefire,kblst50,ResponsibilityNo3245,,">I'd imagine the US has significant influence, they could withdraw funding from Israel, stop sending them weapons,

Israel doesn't need the funding.  They don't rely on US aid, they like getting it but they don't need it.  They'll hear a POTUS out but they aren't going to capitulate to them.

The aid is more about US domestic policy than foreign policy.  Support of Israel has played well at home for decades, shifting demographics and changing opinions of younger citizens make me suspect that it will be less beneficial in years to come. It's the US government, they're not really quick to change.

>but obviously Israel has strategic value for the US in the region and they won't be willing to use their influence if it risks that

True, countries look after their own best interests.  I would suggest if the relationship deteriorated to the point they weren't strategicly beneficial then there wouldn't be any influence.  The west putting Israel into the cold is a scary prospect, they are a nuclear power and the middle east is a tinder box.

>so in practice it's probably not politically feasible for Biden to use his influence, but I'd say they certainly could, if ending this conflict was their number one objective

I don't think Israel is cooling any time soon, I hope I'm wrong.

Personally speaking, the point at which Israel went too far was when it began moves to attack Rafah as well where it had previously told refugees to move to. That is also the opinion of the Labour party and most other parties too, hence calls for a ceasefire now.

Why not condemn it now, have conversations about how extremists should perhaps be taught not to kill people over cartoons, and also **have discussions for the other issues** you mentioned? You wanna talk about how fucked up the far-right is? I support you. But this isn't about that topic right now.

1. No other religion is impervious from criticism and satire as Islam is. Name another religion that isn't being held to the same off-limits standard as Islam. Even in your post, you just assumed I was demonizing 99% of innocent people. **I never said anything about 99% of Muslims being radical.** This is exactly what I mean, when I say that the left pulls the Islamophobia card.
2. Yes, racism is bad, and those who are condemning all Muslims are wrong. But that's not what we're discussing. We're talking about how doctrines within a religion can be interpreted, so why are you bringing up racism? I am literally saying we should empower those moderates in the religion to encourage a less radical view of the religion, and thus a less radical response such as killing someone over a cartoon.
3. Why are you talking about politics. We're just taking about radical Islam and the need to empower moderates. What does politics have to do with that?

I agree, there is a thin line of extremism that extends beyond just religion, it can be political, racial, or just from a world view. And in each community, those who are moderate, **should discuss and oppose extremism** but this discussion is about one particular topic at hand, so I don't know why you're bringing all these other issues here.

Labour,comment,genocide,l293zee,The-Peel,,">What are the chances of him being unseated

Streeting has a majority of just 5,198 which is quite slim for most seats so there is a good enough chance.

The downside is its heavily likely enough Tory swing voters will go from Tory to Labour this time around to give Labour a 1997 style landslide and Streeting could increase his majority with these Tory swing voters.

But if enough of the left and traditional labour voters vote elsewhere it could turn the tide. 

>would this be a rare case where it might actually be justified to vote tory

You could make that case.

Its very unlikely Tories will form another government after the next election so if a Tory MP was elected in Ilford North, there not going to be able to get into government or do anything harmful to the country like Streeting is.

The case could be made to encourage enough left voters to switch to voting Tory in Ilford North just to get rid of Streeting - however this would be an incredibly bad faith type of argument to make, one that a lot of people would scream bloody murder at the thought of and something that not everyone would understand enough to agree to.

It would make the left look petty and bad so its best for now to just encourage people to vote for anyone but Labour and Streeting.

Lib Dems were third in this seat so perhaps maybe encourage them to vote Lib Dem or Leanne Mohammad.",2024-05-02T14:55:13+00:00

ukpolitics,comment,hamas,k4oknbq,jimwhite42,,"The original hypothetical is this:

> Referring to Hamas as terrorists might endanger them. The situation is dangerous enough for them as it is. 

I am challenging the reasoning in that hypothetical. If referring to Hamas as terrorists might endanger them, surely this also means lots of honest reporting might endanger them. So I think this would indicate not that the BBC are not taking sides, but instead they would be compromised.

So I think in the first instance, this is an incredibly dangerous way to look at things.

> I'm sure viewers/listeners are quite capable of making their minds up about Hamas without having it spoon fed to them by the BBC.

This is a pretty questionable statement. I half agree with it, but I think if the BBC is essentially a propaganda outfit on this issue, this can cause a lot of damage because of their reputation - that many otherwise sensible people will not see that they are being incredibly biased on their reporting. Whitewashing Hamas's behaviour is a really terrible thing to participate in IMO (just like it is for the Israeli leadership's behaviour).

One of the examples I saw, was clear footage in one of the previous wars, of Hamas setting up rocket launchers in a school yard (I think, something like that), right next to a load of journalists, and this was not reported on by a lot of them. So this is the kind of thing to go looking for. I will see if I can find something of more substance, but making an argument like isn't a one-liner.

• Condeming War Crimes. 

• Conflating Terrorists with an official state government military.

• Ignoring journalistic standards.

• Sending billions to a rich country who has superior military technology and intelligence than your own. 

To wipe out an “enemy” they have so much power over that they can turn off their water, electricity, fuel and deny children cancer treatment.

All while your own people are suffering, have been told there’s no money and won’t be as affected by the “conflict” as they would ones closer to home. 

Racism is a form of madness that benefits a few at the expense of many. 

It’s an excuse to do the unthinkable by dehumanising a weaker minority, and for others it gives them a sense of superiority without having to do anything than be born. 

It’s very alluring. 

#TL;DR  

The bias & language that seems benign and small is racist. 

These little drops of water on the heads of those on the receiving end, add up. They accumulate and can be paralysing.

“Anyone who commits violence against people with whom I (claim to, but don’t demonstrate) share(ing) values can have any level of violence up to and including war crimes committed against them and that’s fine”?





My values are supposed western values - a belief in truth, justice, equality, in religion and under the law.




That means not blindly supporting far-right nutjobs who want to commit genocide and justify on the grounds that atrocities happened to them in the past. 



That goes for both sides - same way it does for England and Ireland during the troubles. 




My belief is that the UK just tanked it’s own economy, global standing and reputation over a belief in “sovereignty and the right not to be oppressed” *over economic laws imposed by a body they were voluntarily a member of*.





And those same people are today denouncing all Palestinians *as terrorists* for not instantly condemning the only people doing anything to free them from a systemic and globally supported apartheid against them. 




I believe that “terrorism” is a phrase used only by politicians because it is politically loaded and a matter of perspective. 





Ghandi was a terrorist, as was Mandela. Conflict to free peoples from oppression are always written by the victors - whether a group is terrorist or not depends only on if they win.




How do we know this? 




Because of colonialism and our backing of various “terrorist” organizations when it suited us politically - Al Quaida being the most obvious example, but also the Contras in South America, the factions in Syria and Jordan, the first Gulf war - in fact; 






literally every modern conflict - because governments don’t start wars that they aren’t absolutely guaranteed to win.




That leads to guerrilla warfare in response to overwhelming force, because those who are on the receiving end *never had a chance to win*. 






They have the choice to fight guerrilla tactics, or lay down and die - to willingly be subjugated. 





And as Palestine shows, that doesn’t go well for them - they are dehumanized and eventually wiped out completely.





I believe that *if* we in the West believe in freedom and sovereignty, the right to dictate your own laws democratically, then *that applies universally or not at all*. 




*Is everyone free and equal, or not?*





That is the question.





And Europe’s current answer is “what colour are you?”

unitedkingdom,comment,israel,dwiqojx,SophistSophisticated,,"You know Jeremy Corbyn himself has said that the mural was antisemitic. 

But to your point, why does the mural not identify any other religious groups? Nobody is suggesting that you can't identify a bad person because of their religion. 

What is being ignored is that you can absolutely criticize people without referencing, in starkly racist way that hearkens back to a very dark past.

Lets just take criticism of Barack Obama. Now it is not racist to criticize Obama. But if someone put up a mural of Obama as an ape, we would rightly call that out as racist. If someone created a mural of Obama as a druggie and a criminal, something which Obama has himself admitted he did when was young, we would rightly see that as a dog whistle that stereotypes black people as drug addicts and criminals.

If the artist who created the mural objected, that he was only criticizing Obama, and complained that we couldn't criticize black people because of the history of slavery and segregation,  we wouldn't think the complaint legitimate, because you can criticize Obama without resorting to drawing him as an ape, and thereby drawing from a racist past where black people were called apes and subhumans. You can criticize Obama without using dog whistles of drugs and crimes, which draws upon the racist idea that black people are all thugs and criminals.. And if in doing these things, someone called it out and said that these things were racist, feigning blindness to the obvious racism wouldn't be considered a defense.

So, if you want to talk about banking as a problematic thing, there are ways to do it without resorting to antisemitic caricatures. If you want to talk about the history of Rothschild, (and I would like you to explain the ""exploitation"" that they supposedly committed) you can do so without resorting to dog whistles and antisemitic caricatures. 

You can name and shame people who do bad things, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, or religion.

However, if your criticisms use racist imagery, if your criticisms are misogynistic, if your criticisms use ethnic caricatures, that is wrong and people can criticize you for that.

So you need to defend Bandera because...the Russians rightfully point out you like Bandera? What kind of circular logic is this? 

>I defend him only when people write that Volyyn massarce was his fault - you can check in 1941 -1944 he was in German concentration camp.

That doesn't absolve him of the responsibility for what his movement did. Hitler committed suicide on April30. Germany did not surrender untill May8. Those few days the war Hitler was responsible for still continued even though Hitler was a corpse. 

>He is a person who fight for Ukraine and Ukrainian people...we defend those guys who fought against USSR till 1957 in UPA.

UPA fought for the same reasons the Nazis did. UPA didn't need to commit genocide against Poles for it's freedom, this was just Nazi style imperialism. Make some dumb terretories claim based on bad history and slaughter the people already there. And antisemitism. The UPA leader literally stated the Nazis plans to exterminate Jews was the right idea and he endorses it.  What you people need to understand is that UPA were literal Nazi wannabees and trying to excuse them because ""they fought for Ukraine"" is just bad nationalist history and the same exact mental gymnastics German nationalists use to defend the Nazis.

europe,comment,jew,in1p0uy,strl,,"Oh great, a nonsensical comment claiming Israel is fascist and of course you are an expert on Israel because you are a Jew.

I'll start with the elephant in the room, [Israel is defined as a flawed democracy, on par with France and better than the United states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index), if Israel is fascist we must accept that almost every country in the world is.

Regarding your actual ""points"", they all consist of taking a component, devoiding it of the context (that it should be found in the extreme) and just acting like it applies to Israel. Going by the list in order:

1. In Israel flags are not everywhere and aren't used as clothes commonly, outside of independence day or specific national holidays it is about what you'd expect from any other country. That Jews outside of Israel **choose** to identify with the Israeli flag has nothing to do with this component.

2. Israel has a robust legal team in the IDF exactly to try to follow international law, this is acknowledged by most of its allies. Yes, mistakes happen but, hey, [if we're mentioning hospitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunduz_hospital_airstrike)... This happens to almost every army in almost every war.

3. Generally understood to be in excess of actual threat, over the last Ramadan 19 people were murdered in Israel during terrorist attacks, this is not some imagined threat.

4. Again, in excess of actual threat, I don't think many people here will claim that Finland invests too much in the military despite the fact it invests a lot and has not been in a war since WWII because they understand that Russia is a threat to Finland. Israel on the other hand has had far more armed conflicts.

Actual examples of this are places like modern Egypt or Francoist Spain were a gigantic military structure is maintained despite the lack of actual need. By contrast Israel has throughout history lowered the size of its army as threats decreased and has decreased within the last decade the service time for soldiers. While the budget is still high its share of government expenditure has consistently gone down. 

More importantly is that this support of the military should be to the detriment of domestic agendas but Israel has increased its quality of life, GDP and HDI massively in the 70 years it existed. So while on the surface ""Ah hmm yes..."" might seem like an intelligent comment it is anything but.  

4. I don't even know what to say to someone who thinks Al-Jazeera is more neutral on Israel than Haaretz or ynet but it's good you mentioned them because the fact Israel allows foreign press critical of it to operate in Israel is exactly proof that the government doesn't engage in mass censorship. Also most of this component is about government ownership of the media, most of the media in Israel is private, the point is just patently untrue. 

[RSF which places Israeli media as around the middle in world rankings says](https://rsf.org/en/index):

>The Israeli media enjoy real freedom, but Palestinian journalists experience major difficulties in exercising their profession.

So at least internally Israel is anything but what you claim it is.

5. Israel doesn't even have a state religion, sure there's remnants of the Ottoman millet system which gives religious institutions inordinate control over civil law but that is not the context of this component.

I'm not even going to go into the theological debate because I don't believe much in religion and I doubt you do.

6. Well, [Israel does have corruption issues, not worse than many European countries though and better than most of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index#:~:text=The%20index%20is%20published%20annually,2020%20and%2030%20April%202021). Also you want to prove this point by claiming that Netanyahu wasn't punished *yet*. One Netanyahu would not be the first Israeli prime minister to go to prison over corruption, so Israel is not averse to dealing with corruption. Two, if you had followed Israeli news and not Al-Jazeera you would know that there is no unexpected delay in Netanyahus trial, it was always expected to take around 2-3 years because it's an extremely complex case with hundreds of witnesses. 

7. Netanyahu never broke the law regarding elections, nor has there ever been a meaningful claim of election fraud or fraudulent elections in Israel, the fact Netanyahu actually lost the last elections should highlight that they are, in fact, fair.

>Yeah I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say Israel is at best sliding into fascism and is at worst already there.

I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say you know almost next to nothing about Israel, but take heart, the amount of upvotes you got indicates you're not alone.

People can't have this both ways when discussing and criticising Israel actions and politics though.  

Most people don't give a flying hoot about Judaism but have issues with the way the government of Israel behaves and (in my mind) are rightly criticising their actions especially with regard to the treatment of Palestinians, illegal settlements ect.  

If Israel sees criticism of their actions as a country being labelled as anti-Semetic, they are the ones bringing god into the argument as it were.  They are the ones who are turning a human rights issue into a ""racist"" one where they can play the victim.     

Put it a different way - nobody is labelled ""anti-Christian"" because they criticise the actions of the Christian militias in Tchad and CAR, nor are they labelled ""anti-Islamic"" because they criticise ISIS or even the concept of ISIS.

- Hamas has operated a separate fund for years predating before its takeover of the Gaza Strip in 2007. In 2001, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the founder of Hamas, boasted that Hamas payments to the families of prisoners and of **suicide bombers** totaled between $2 and $3 million.

Scotland,comment,muslim,je4362x,Audioboxer87,,">Humza Yousaf was elected as Scotland’s new First Minister on Tuesday after a majority of lawmakers backed him to become the first ever racial minority and Muslim to lead the country. Yousaf will be sworn in Wednesday and takes over from Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first female leader and the country’s longest-serving one yet.  
>  
>“As immigrants of this country who knew barely a word of English, they could not have imagined in their wildest dreams that their grandson would one day be on the cusp of being the next First Minister of Scotland,” Yousaf said of his grandparents at Edinburgh’s Murrayfield Stadium on Monday. “We should all take pride in the fact that today we have sent a clear message that your color of skin or indeed your faith is not a barrier to leading the country that we all call home.”  
>  
>Yousaf was announced the Scottish National Party’s sixth leader in Edinburgh on Monday, marking the end of what had become an acrimonious and unpredictable leadership contest. Of the three candidates, which included the Scottish finance secretary Kate Forbes and former junior minister Ash Regan, Yousaf was widely seen as the continuity candidate and the favorite of the SNP leadership (save for Sturgeon, who declined to endorse a successor). In the end, he secured the backing of 52.1% of the SNP’s card-carrying members, who were the only ones eligible to vote in the leadership contest.  
>  
>Yousaf’s victory isn’t historic for Scotland alone. He is the first Muslim politician elected to be a national leader in a Western democracy, according to Sunder Katwala, the director of the British Future think tank. Yousaf is also the first ever ethnic-minority leader of a devolved U.K. government. That his victory comes so soon after the election of Britain’s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak last year and Ireland’s Taoiseach Leo Varadkar returning to power in December 2022 means that, for the first time in history, the British, Scottish, and Irish leaders are all of South Asian origin.  
>  
>While Yousaf is expected to build on Sturgeon’s progressive policies—including supporting the Scottish government’s reforms to make it easier for people to legally change their gender, which were ultimately blocked by the British government in Westminster—his backers say Yousaf will nonetheless carve out his own leadership style. “There’s more to Humza than perhaps people recognize,” Ian Blackford, the SNP’s former Westminster leader, previously told TIME, adding: “He will be very much a team player. He will show leadership, but he will have people around the table with him.”  
>  
>But perhaps the most immediate challenge facing Yousaf will be to unite his party. The leadership contest—the first the nationalist party has held in nearly two decades, because Sturgeon ran for the top post in 2014 unopposed—exposed deep divisions within the SNP, prompting some of the party’s senior members to even speculate about the possibility of a potential split. Such an outcome would be a major boon for the Scottish Labour and Conservative parties, both of which have struggled to best the SNP in recent elections. The most immediate electoral test for Yousaf will be the next U.K. general election, due to take place by January 2025.  
>  
>“That doesn’t give them very much time,” says Nicola McEwen, a professor of territorial politics at the University of Edinburgh, noting that if the SNP loses seats in that contest, Yousaf “might not have the tenure that Nicola Sturgeon or her predecessor had.”

Whether these individuals succeed or fail as political entities, this is definitely a hard one for #TeamBrexit

The channel 4 survey is. I'm not interested enough to look into the methodology of the pink news one.

>Or are you sure that if they would show a different result, one that would show Muslims not to be any more bigoted than the rest of the population, you would have no issue with it?

It would entirely depend upon whether the methodology introduced bias. If the result showed them to be less homophobic than the rest of the population I'd be inclined to disbelieve it.

>I think it's you, not the poll that's biased. 

Honestly, I have so little regard for your opinion that I'm not going to waste any time pretend to care about it.

>Instead of blaming some conspiracy of hidden bad motives that the EU (who commissioned the study), Gallup (that did it) and me are all part of it,

Critiquing a methodological introduction of bias is not a conspiracy.

>it's just you who are trying to spread hatred by belittling and minimising homophobia in the Muslim community

No, I was literally talking to a Muslim friend yesterday night about the problems with homophobia in the British Muslim community and how it compares to Middle Eastern cultural attitudes, as he has experience of both.

Rather than using a biased survey to try to justify spreading hate on reddit, I'm actually talking to the big scary Muslims. He was telling me about the difference he sees due to demographic divisions, how younger more educated Muslims are generally much more tolerant even within Muslim majority countries but that the older and more entrenched bigoted attitudes are still very strong.

You can discuss this topic without just spreading hateful nonsense and pretending the Muslim community is a monolithic, single-minded entity that must be thwarted.

Do you know what else my friend said to me? He said he thought this was the ""shameful aspect of Islamic culture"" and that he was ""generally reluctant to discuss it with non-Muslims because so many people use it as an excuse for bigotry rather than trying to change people's values.""

Those are his words and he's right. You're an example of this.

People like you aren't some crusaders against homophobia in Islam, you're part of the problem and suppress the younger voices that would be more progressive. You and people like you are impediments to progress not unlike the Muslim homophobic bigots who are at the root of the problem.

>The difference is, I don't wish these things to be true but accept it. You just ignore them because you don't wish them to be true.

Usually, the 'change' in religion doesn't come from the text itself, but from how people respond to and interpret it. Like how if you ask someone if they follow the bible, and they're like 'yes, every page', you only have to pull up Leviticus to have them either backtrack or tell you it doesn't count (even though it's in the bible).

The Quran is no better than the bible. It too can (and does) have thousands of different interpretations. The only difference is it hasn't been ripped up and edited by kings and scholars over the years and what was written once upon a time in farmville remains the same.

Both have been used throughout history to justify untold bloodshed and authoritarian control over the lives of innocents.

That's not to say there's no good to be found in there either. Often the community spirit that comes out of religion is a major plus, as well as the comfort of knowing that if you behave you'll get rewarded after you're too dead to say 'heeey this isn't what you prom...!'. That comfort keeps people from doing naughties*^^[citation ^^needed]*.

One of the very first observations I made about religion. I don't even know how old I was, but I was definitely younger than 8... You have books that are supposed to be the words of god, yet they come rolling off the same printing presses that give us the word of man, and King James has his very own version. Is he a god? Buildings where you go and sing to someone who apparently gave us the ability to sing. This isn't going to be news or special for such a person. Putting myself in that position, I'd be like 'what the hell do I want with your praise? (EDIT: adding: I can think whole star systems into existence with the blink of an eye. I'm sure I can withstand going a few days without you lot droning off-key songs I've heard millions of times before) Use that gift for yourselves!'.

It just didn't add up, so I read the new testament cover to cover when I was 10. That was an unsatisfactory experience to say the least.

I have respect for religion, from the standpoint of spirituality (belief in a higher power, and such, and being inspired to do right in the world), but there's no way I'm ever going to *believe* in it. I *don't* have respect for the way it's used as a form of massively-organised control, clearly governed by people, for people.

Needless to say, I extend the exact same amount of cynicism to Muslims as I do to Christians. No more, no less. As in, I appreciate them as people, I often enjoy and am fascinated by their customs and cultures. I respect the spirituality of their positions, even though I will definitiely disagree there, but have zero respect for large swathes of the 'you must do X' angle.

I think that if parents want to raise their children according to their beliefs, religious or otherwise, that's fair.  It's down to them.

Furthermore, many Germans bore the worst of Hitler's oppression: he cracked down on German labor unions and German leftists before he started the Holocaust.

So I bet Germans resent being forced to be ashamed of their history; they probably feel singled out for a disproportionate amount of shame, and they feel they cannot properly express their resentment of the damage that the Allies inflicted upon them in WWII because everyone would say, ""Oh, you deserved it.

northernireland,post,palestine,17rdmsb,sqy2,Braverman clarifies Northern Ireland comments amid angry criticism,"[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/09/braverman-clarifies-northern-ireland-comments-amid-angry-criticism](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/09/braverman-clarifies-northern-ireland-comments-amid-angry-criticism)

Suella Braverman has been forced to clarify that she had been referring to dissident republicans in an article in which she likened the pro-Palestine protests in London to sectarian marches in Northern Ireland.

In an article for the Times, the home secretary described the recent protests in central London as an “assertion of primacy by certain groups – particularly Islamists – of the kind we are more used to seeing in Northern Ireland”.

Her comments were in response to the announcement by the Met police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, that he did not have grounds to ban a march due to take place on Armistice Day.

The comparison to sectarian displays of identity in Northern Ireland caused confusion, however, as it is the unionist and loyalist community that is better known for marching.

A marching season between Easter Monday and the end of September in Northern Ireland is known for the processions by a range of unionist groups, including the Apprentice Boys of Derry and the Orange Order.

Former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Hain said he had presumed the remarks were an attack on Orange Order marches.

He said: “Why on earth is this gratuitously offensive Home Secretary meddling in Northern Ireland affairs with her ignorant attack on Orange Order marches by traditional unionists?”

The BBC reported on Thursday morning that “a source close to the home secretary” had said Braverman was referring to the activities of “dissident republicans”.

The comments have drawn angry criticism from politicians in Northern Ireland.

Colum Eastwood, the MP for Foyle and leader of the SDLP, the nationalist party whose founding member, John Hume, won a Nobel prize for his championing of the peace process in Northern Ireland, called Braverman a “pound-shop Enoch Powell”.

“The comments comparing the proposed Armistice Day protests against the appalling bombardment of civilians in Gaza with the marching tradition in Northern Ireland are an exercise in what can only be described as aggressive ignorance,” he said. “Ignorance of the conditions faced by the civilian population in Gaza, ignorance of the role of the Met police, ignorance of the complex history and traditions of marching and protest in Northern Ireland. She has managed to offend just about everyone – no mean feat in a divided society.

“The comments are far below the standard that should be expected from a senior government minister. The only appropriate action now is her removal from office but given the systemic weakness of this government, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if she remained.”

Stephen Farry, an MP for the Alliance party, which originally represented moderate and non-sectarian unionism but which now takes a neutral approach to the union, said the “comparisons to Northern Ireland are pathetic”, describing Braverman’s comments as the latest “of a series of cruel comments and oppressive policies”.

Sinn Féin’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Matt Carthy, claimed the home secretary had “as much knowledge about the situation in Northern Ireland as she seems to have about the situation in Palestine at the moment”.

He told the BBC’s Good Morning Ulster programme: “The British government has taken a disappointing stance in my view in respect of the ongoing conflict in Gaza.

“I would argue if British ministers are in the frame of mind where they want to talk about Ireland and the north, the frame of mind they should be in is ensuring the DUP return to Stormont and we get the executive up and running.”

David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said the home secretary seemed to be “seeking to exploit the sensitivities of this moment, and an ignorance of Northern Ireland’s history, to inflame community tensions for her own leadership campaign”.

However, the DUP MP Ian Paisley defended Braverman’s broader criticism of the police in the article.

He told the Commons: “When women were treated brutally and unjustly by the Metropolitan police in this city in the wake of the Sarah Everard murder, this house – inside and out – members came out to criticise the police, correctly, for their failure and their brutality … The hand-wringing hypocrisy and the pant-wetting that we are seeing over someone criticising the police correctly is amazing.”",2023-11-09T14:03:38+00:00

Personally speaking, I think Starmer should go, but if I was in England I'd still vote for Labour (or vote tactically to help Labour).

> A huge cache of leaked WhatsApp messages and emails show senior officials from the party’s right wing, who worked at its HQ, became despondent as Labour climbed in the polls during the election campaign despite their efforts . . .

Contrariwise, in London one may feel that there are more 'foreigners' than British, let alone more non-white British than white British.

If someone arrives on a 'casual' work visa though, it's more likely they are in larger cities where there is more of an ethnic mix.

Really? You've fleed the destruction of your home and city, the deaths of family members, and walked across a continent, to seek refuge and a better life in a completely alien country, where you were told you had to live in a council house on an island where there is no work for you?

Right. But you still get to question ""was this person convicted of rape"" and ""is this person a foreign national?"" You'd also probably want to go through ""have they exhausted all opportunities for appeal?"" as, as we've seen recently, being convicted of rape doesn't mean the person is actually a rapist.

europe,comment,un,jwpe6op,kiil1,,"There is a lot of valid criticism for the rushed transition of Russian-speaking schools to Estonian-language, which is clearly heavily influenced by the political situation. 

However, this UN press release is truly an epitome of the incredibly superficial and hollow ""work"" the UN does. 

Especially the final conclusion is incredibly misleading by using terms like ""minority languages"" even though the problem concerns specifically an occupation-era parallel education system *only* in Russian. Many other ethnic minorities study in Russian in those schools and *not* in their own native/minority language (Armenians, Belarusians, even Jews etc).

There is also the aspect how the headline cites that the amendments *may* violate human rights, but citation in the article confidently expresses that the amendments are in contravention of ""international human rights instruments"". Which one is it, then? Also, what human right is exactly violated? Is one minority special that in they have a right to education in their own language, but not others? How does that relate to a country's rights relating its language policy? Or is any step restricting usage of any minority language always a violation?

Don't be mistaken, this reform does deserve some heavy criticism and would need much more public debate, but such incredibly superficial comments from UN human rights are likely to damage the debate than actually help it. Russians will point out to ""violation of human rights"" and nobody else will care because the ""arguments"" given are so incredibly bad.",2023-08-18T11:08:05+00:00

The problem is that technologying ourselves out of it is literally the only scenario that might actually work. None of the others are remotely feasible.

We can't ask places like India to stay in poverty, which is basically the non-technologying option. They're going to continue growing economically, which will come with bigger carbon footprints as they do so. And, due to the size of the developing vs. developed worlds, none of that increased carbon footprint from the developing world can be offset by the developed world becoming ""less consumerist"" - whatever that actually means in practice.

The only thing that might stop (or significantly slow) climate change is new technology that would enable the developing world to continue developing with significantly smaller carbon footprints than the 19th or 20th centuries in Europe or USA.

Transport Minister Eamon Ryan and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announcing increased A5 funding last week.
The total cost of the massive road project has spoked by £600m in under five years.

The review of major capital projects published this morning by the Northern Ireland Audit Office (NIAO) provides fresh details on the Derry to Augnacloy road.

Auditor General Dorinnia Carville’s report points to ongoing delays and cost overruns.

The A5
The A5
""The project continues to be delayed. Following a third public inquiry, DfI received the final advisory report from the Planning Appeals Commission and is now considering the points raised and detailed recommendations made.

""This project was originally planned to be completed in 2018 at a cost of £799 million. Subject to the outcome of the PAC inquiry, DfI’s latest estimate is for completion in 2028 at a cost of £1.7bn,” the report states.

The road project was boosted last week by the Irish Government’s decision to reinstate and increase its financial commitment to €600m (£514m).

But the overall cost has now risen by £600m since March 2019 when the estimate was £1.1bn.

The A6, though substantially completed, also comes under scrutiny.

The Auditor General refers to delays and rising costs due to Brexit, COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine and points out that the northernmost section of the road will not be completed this year as planned because of issues around the Mobuoy dump.

She states: “It was originally expected to cost £594m and is now expected to cost £655m. It is substantially complete. The project was to be delivered in two sections, with the second section split in to two phases.

""The first section (Randalstown to Castledawson) opened in May 2021 and is expected to have a final cost of £192m (compared to an original planned completion date of October 2020 and original estimated cost of £184m).

""Phase one of section two (Dungiven to Drumahoe) was opened in April 2023 at an estimated final cost of £264m (compared to a planned completion date of 2021 and cost of £239m).

“DfI told us COVID-19 had an unprecedented negative impact on delivery of the A6 scheme, and this was exacerbated on the A6 Dungiven to Drumahoe section by the impacts of Brexit, the war in Ukraine and other inflationary pressures.

""Phase two of section two (Caw to Drumahoe) was originally estimated to be completed by 2024 however the Department for Infrastructure told us it is on hold as works will encroach on to the illegal Mobouy waste site.”

The audit report observes that the northernmost section was placed on hold in March 2019 and that up until August 2023 £6.8m had been spent on it.

Ms. Carville looked at seven flagship projects across the North and found only one, the Belfast Rapid Transit project, was fully completed. 

“It remains extremely concerning that, more than four years after my Office’s last report on this issue, there is little evidence of improvement or past lessons learned being applied to new projects.

""Even among the flagship projects, identified as the NI Executive’s highest priority, progress has been very limited. It is clear that departments are not achieving value for money in the delivery of these major capital projects,” she said.",2024-02-27T17:11:40+00:00

It was more important to William to defeat James to avoid a base of opposition in Ireland than it was to Louis for James to win. William was distracted from the main war in Europe so for Louis it was win-win. 

James supported freedom of religious worship but William supported the established churches, and hence the Penal Laws, for political expediency. The Penal laws were an attempt to drive Catholics and Dissenters to the established CoI, CoE, and CoS churches, so non-Anglicans also suffered.

ukpolitics,comment,zionist,d2rg3x6,AndyBea,,"> I can't speak about the particulars of Nelson Mandela - I don't know any details - but you can't categorically call someone a terrorist. It depends on your point of view.

Mandela had the same inalienable right that the Palestinians possess - to resist colonialisation. Probably in any way they see fit (though that needs testing in court).

There is a second important difference - Mandela's people had been war-like and were defeated by better technology.

Whereas in Palestine the natives are being punished for being much too gentle.",2016-05-03T19:58:00+00:00

 >The angry black woman stereotype is a trope in American society that portrays African-American women as sassy, ill-mannered, and ill-tempered by nature. Related concepts are the ""sapphire"" or ""sassy black woman"". Scholars Dionne Bennett and Marcyliena Morgan suggest that the stereotype is less studied than the mammy and Jezebel archetypes because researchers accept it as true. Carolyn West defines the Angry Black Woman as one variety of a Sapphire stereotype (another category listed is ""Sistas with Attitude"").

ukpolitics,comment,zionists,fcmtjl7,Foolish_Bob,,"It really depends on the credibility of the message and whether people give a shit. Calling Trump out in his shit certainly energised people against him enough that he lost the popular vote (and had the Democrats not been stupid and complacent they'd have won the college too). The Britain First joining the Tories and Nick Griffin supporting Labour stories don't really have any impact though because almost no-one takes either of them seriously.

There's a limit to how far you can push the negative messaging though. Extending the narrative from ""Trump is racist and sexist"" to ""if you vote Trump you're racist and sexist"" was an obviously idiotic move that was always going to backfire in the way that it did.

So negative messaging has a place. You need to point out that bringing back hunting is a shit idea, or that snatching 10% of companies is economically and politically illiterate, but if you push too hard it backfires, and if you're stupid enough to attack the voters (by for instance suggesting that Brexit voters didn't know what they were voting for) then you deserve the electoral spanking you get.",2019-12-31T11:26:01+00:00
