The Palestinians now have only two small places to live, parts of the west bank and Gaza, the conditions there are inhumane and have been called by the united nations the world’s biggest open air prison.
The recent attack on the Israeli occupiers has been called an act of terrorism when it is in fact just an attempt to fight for freedom.

To be honest you do several places in this very comment.

>  so we should build them an ethnostate on stolen land.

That was the comment I objected to.  The UK didn't build them a state.  The Jews built themselves a state.

> Why should the work not be done to fix the conditions they are fleeing, 

It could very well have.  Had the British in the 19th century considered antisemitism a serious problem and worked hard to fight it likely there never would have been a mass movement for Zionism.  In 2020 that's not relevant anymore the option isn't open.  Now with a few exceptions they are done fleeing, Israel is their home where they were born.  

> or even integrate them into Palestine without giving them dominion over another group of people.

That was attempted.  The Zionists were amenable to that.  The problem is the natives (Palestinians) were supremacist.  They objected to the immigration and they objected to the immigrants ""disrupting their cultural norms"" which were Ottoman and thus involved Muslim supremacy. They were quite right.  The Zionists intended unlimited immigration and intended to establish equality.  When the Palestinians reacted violently on several attempts the made the Yishuv stronger and then finally  were crushed by the Yishuv.  The British weren't the ones who ""gave them dominion"". 

>  They had absolutely nothing to do with the rise of Hitler,

That's correct.  They weren't the ones who started any of the various European antisemitisms.  They did something do with foreclosing the option of expulsion and so  why the Nazi regime ultimately choose extermination rather than expulsion.  They also  after the holocaust was over and knowing full well what had happened took the position that the Jews in the Displace Persons Camps should freeze to death rather than being allowed to move to Palestine. So let's get to the period of time when the events were relevant.  

Additionally the Palestinians certainly promoted the 1950s wave of antisemitism in Muslim countries which pushed the Mizrahi Jews out.  So if your criteria is ""started"" rather than merely ""facilitated"" there is an example of started. 

> We don't really tolerate this from anyone else in the world.

You must certainly do tolerate it all over the world.  There are governments all over the planet dominated by one of the tribes in the territory.

>  and to say we don't get to question it because the Jews had a rough go is beyond stupid.

Can you name one time everyone has ever said that?  What does get questioned is your right to make up positions Jews don't hold and then mock them for holding them like you just did there.

> Why aren't we creating an ethnostate for the Palestinian people in their homeland and arming them too? 

What do you think has been British policy since the 1930s?  What do you think the two state solution means?  

> Pretending that the Balfour declaration didn't happen, which lent legitimacy and also paved the way for the sale of huge amount of military hardware

The British imposed arms restrictions on the Yishuv. UK policy was literally precisely the opposite of what you are stating here.  

> [The Yishuv] had support and arms flowing from superpowers 

They most certainly did not.  Quite the opposite until the Soviets intervened and Czechoslovakia gave the Yishuv heavy arms.  Prior to that almost all the arms were smuggled or illegally built over British attempts to make sure the Jews couldn't defend themselves.

> Tell me why, today, we should be supporting a theocratic police state that maintains the world's last apartheid?

No one is asking you to support them.  What people are asking you to do is to treat them like any of the other hundred plus tribal regimes whose government you don't like and mostly ignore them.  

You are the one who is seeking to make them an enemy of the UK with (depending on your policy) an explicit goal of: territorial diminishment,  regime change or possibly total population destruction.  And then be shocked that the supporters of the state are outraged by this policy.  Much as you are about Tony Blair having similar feelings about the Ba'ath in Iraq.

How are you supposed to deradicalize people who are massively radicalized and live in a society where authority has currently become oriented around further radicalizing them, without seizing that authority and retooling it to push people towards greater tolerance and reason?

Remember we are dealing with a situation far more radical (in this sense, in terms of how deeply the radicalization goes) than even the Nazis and other fascists were in during WWII and after. It's not like we saw widespread suicide bombings and other acts of protracted insurgency by Germans after WWII, and that was even a situation where the victorious allies ethnically cleansed Germans from many areas like Silesia and Pomerania. 

After all the totalitarianism of the Nazis to establish complete control over society, and the hundreds of thousands of German civilians killed when allies carpet bombed German cities, and the rapes and butchery of the Red Army, and the expulsions of German civilians, the German people... basically accepted that it was necessary to give up and accept a new way of life under the authority of the victorious allies

Whereas in the Israeli/Palestine conflict, Palestine has waged multiple aggressive wars and attacks against the Jewish state, with the desire to destroy the Jewish state and massacre it's people, and despite being crushed each time, they keep rising up again and again to keep futilely trying to erase the Jewish state.
