ukpolitics,comment,UKIP,ixi41jr,Xezshibole,,"This is an opportune time to take it and not suffer effects of walling off England, all due to one key reason.

UK, and definitely England, cannot and will not properly check Single Market goods well into the foreseeable future. It's waving in SM goods as if it were still in SM, largely because checks cause delays, lowering trade flow. It's the flow of goods, most prominently food. In short, properly implementing the checks would trigger an immediate food shortage, hence the government preferring this even as opening UK market to near seamless EU flow while not getting it reciprocated is deeply disadvantageous to UK businesses.

Scotland in contrast has pledged to rejoin the full EU. Though that may or may not be quick, rejoining the Single Market and Customs Union is definitely quicker and a prerequisite to the EU anyways.

When Scotland rejoins SM and sets up a hard border between the two, England is forced to wave in Scottish goods as it is doing with other Single Market members or discriminate against a SM member. And we all saw how the EU reacted to that during the Trump trade wars. Meaning Scotland keeps most if not all its market share in England as SM and Northern Ireland have.

Meanwhile Scotland walls off English exports into Scotland, substituting it with SM/NI/Scottish goods just as Northern Ireland has done.

In exchange for all of this, Scotland regains *seamless* access to a 460 million sized market.

For the record Northern Ireland is the best performing region in the UK right now, with a nonfunctioning government to boot. They manage this precisely because the SM is so important to the economy, they maintain most of their pre-Brexit market share in England as SM has done, and there's so much former UK market share in SM, NI, and now Scotland to expand into.

Edit: Seems like someone below is so thin skinned they blocked me before I could reply. No matter.

>if England wanted to increase checks 10000x on goods entering on the EU Scottish border (vs. say the French) to punish Scottish exporters it would be perfectly within its rights to do so

And it would perfectly be within the rights of all other SM members to sanction England for discriminating against one of their own. And as we can see from the current and future *voluntary* unequal border arrangements, SM needs the UK a *lot* less than the other way around.",2022-11-23T16:45:12+00:00,t1_ixhfj1w

You can't even declare non-dom tax status and bring money into the country without being taxed twice. Once upon a time people used to earn monies abroad and bring it back into the country. I am currently working in Saudi and fly back every 3 weeks or so.

Ir35 changes also closed a lot of the consultancy loopholes meaning people need to go PAYE unless under exception circumstances.

The UK government is currently stamping down and ensuring it gets every piece of cash it can because of the current debt levels and borrowing set up by older age groups.

This together with the ability to stifle growth into Europe is beyond me. Before Brexit vote the UK construction industry was due to take Europe and several large contracts to bring money into the country and pay the bills. Then the old people decided to have a opinion and fucked it all.

In fact, due to the border situation, it would probably make a lot of sense to have concurrent, tripartite talks.

UK/EU to work out their issues, UK/Scotland to work out their issues, and UK/EU.

I honestly don't know how a separation arrangement could be reached without negotiations on all those three parts.

A chaotic separation would be bad for everyone, see ""hard brexit.""

Now that Scotland is, along with the UK, out of the EU, It would probably make more sense to have a transitional process where Scotland temporarily remains within the UK while negotiations take place between all parties.

That process would take longer, but lead to less disruption.

It’s not a “reward” to let them stay in this country. It’s just basic decency. Some of them want to be here because they have family or friends here. Some want to be here because they can speak the language and it’s already terrifying being uprooted from your home and having your whole life go up in flames without having the additional stress of not understanding what is going on because you can’t speak the language. Some of them want to come to the U.K. because they feel unsafe in the country they ended up in. 

There are no legal routes from Europe to the U.K.

If you want to stop people crossing illegally, you have to make legal routes. 

I was listening to the founder of the Say it Loud charity - a gay Ugandan man who came to the U.K. as a student and was tortured when he went back to Uganda because of his sexuality. He had six months on his U.K. visa so he just flew back to the U.K. and stayed as an illegal immigrant here for five years because the U.K. didn’t recognise asylum on the basis of sexuality in those days. 

People trying to come to the U.K. are not necessarily people unfamiliar with the country. Lots of people from countries like Syria used to be affluent enough to travel. Some might have been here for university. Some might still have links to the community and are pinning their hopes on that. Some might know people working in asylum charities here. Is it enough to risk your life? 

Maybe not for you, or for me. But living in a war zone can do strange things to your perception of risk. Let’s not forget these people are severely traumatised in many cases.

brexit,comment,Tories,iuckl9j,maxlan,,"Brits hate europe. The only way to make EU a success is to be a full member. The only way we will be a full member is to leave and people to realise how good it was.

Unfortunately now we have left, not only are the brexiteers pointing out all the shit still happening, but bremainers are shouting about all the bad shit they are doing to us. Which is pushing those on the fence further away.


Like the whole disabled parking thing. About 10/40 countries decided that the UK disabled badge might not give people the same privileges.

Brmainers are like ""look, if we were in, this wouldn't be a problem""

Brexiteers are like ""it is only a problem because those countries made it a problem. Weren't you telling me the great thing about the eu is harmonised rules and no one country can do what they want? Isn't that exactly what is happening here 10 countries doing what they want. So what's the point of it again""

Why has it ruined the country? Because about a third want out, a third want in and a third don't care. If you could slice that up per region, we would probably be having a civil war.

So, the government, which everyone now hates for giving massive tax breaks to the rich, being rich or ignoring their own rules and having a piss up while other people were dying alone, is trying to govern a country where 2 thirds of it hate the other 2 thirds for disagreeing with them.

Overall if they hadn't screwed up the covid response so bad, we could be winning right now. The rest of the EU should be almost bankrupted by the freak weather and taking refugees from ukraine in mid east. Both of those things have affected us a lot less than many other countries.


Putin taking Ukraine was a master stroke. Climate change has destroyed harvests, so he's taken a whole country that is reasonably unaffected and has a LOT of farmland. Next year economic sanctions will be dropped and EU'll be buying ukrainian grown food from Russia. UK may buy from USA instead because we can change our food hygeine rules more easily.",2022-10-30T08:35:39+00:00,t3_yglesr

All of the scandals and corruption aside (honestly I'm deaf to it now, it's just concern trolling, I operate on the assumption all politicians are self serving scumbags, after what the Tories got away with in the pandemic, why should I care?), my main problem with the SNP has been the blanket contrarianism in their platform. Anything that can be used to show there's a purported difference in cultural and political outlook between Scotland and England is weaponised. So many SNP voters are already so diehard nationalist that the SNP could be a single issue party and they'd still vote for them, but the SNP insists on picking up wedge issue after wedge issue to beat the ""look how different from the English we are"" drum. Makes me kinda hope we become independent just so we can focus on voting for policies other than yes/no to independence again.
