The problem is that the damn Jews insist of surviving attempts to exterminate them. That is just unjustified.

Take this article, for example, written by a Holocaust survivor:

It would probably be classed as anti-Semitic according to the definitions, but the point he is making by juxtaposing Israel's treatment or the Palestinians with the Nazi's treatment of the Jews is basically: how can we do this to other people, given what we came through as a nation? What's happened to our empathy, and our common humanity?

ukpolitics,comment,Israel,k8dbebb,LycanIndarys,,">the protest tradition is about achieving political goals. they can be about spreading awareness (like ER, JSO, etc) as a precursor to achieving political goals, but there has to be a goal else what's the point?

Because it makes people feel like that they're doing something.  And because they don't agree with your interpretation of what the purpose of the rally is.

>even on this surface level 'spread awareness' vibe, the IDF have killed immeasurably more civilians and children in this conflict, never mind over the decades, 

While I think that Israel *probably* have killed more civilians & children in the conflict, I don't think you can say that it's definitely true.  Hamas have already proven with that hospital story (where they claimed that 500 people had been killed in an Israeli strike on a hospital; it turned out to be a hospital car-park that was hit by a Hamas rocket that went wrong, and it definitely didn't kill anywhere near 500 people) that they simply cannot be trusted to report deaths accurately.  Nor do they distinguish between civilians and terrorist deaths - they just report them *all* as civilian deaths.

But even if Israel have killed more, it's not a fair equivalence, so it's not reasonable to use that as a justification for protesting against Israel rather than Hamas.  Israel strikes result in more deaths because Hamas go out of their way to maximise Palestinian civilian deaths by putting military targets amongst the civilian population, and therefore using Palestinian civilians as human shields.  Simultaneously, Israel does everything that they can to protect their own civilian populations as best as they can, by intercepting as many Hamas rockets as possible with their Iron Dome.

Those discrepancy in death counts is absolutely not reflective of their separate approaches to civilian casualties, and thus should not be used as a moral judgement of their actions.

>so even by this false metric one would expect there to be more protests showing palestinian solidarity than isreali.

There certainly have been more pro-Palestine rallies than pro-Israel; though that's mostly because British Jews are currently incredibly fearful of antisemitic violence right now.  Which, to circle back to my original point, is being met with deafening silence from the sort of people that usually crop up whenever a minority group expresses concern.",2023-11-08T15:48:03+00:00,t1_k8d920t

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Hamas,kbnsgic,TeddyBongwater,,"Thankfully the ruling elite and the CIA will never let Trump win again. It's why we are seeing him prosecuted on 3 fronts. 


I really hope my conspiracy theory is right. Here are the bullet points:

-The US justice system is controlled by the ruling elite. Remember when the attorney General in Florida was ordered to stop investigating Epstein 20 years ago or when Matt Gaetz legal troubles just went away. Or how politicians and rich CEOs never face justice. It's because the elite control our justice system and their are countless examples. 

-The elite have decided to use the justice system to go after trump. Yes he broke many laws and you could argue they are prosecuting him on 3 fronts because he broke serious laws,  but he had been doing that for decades. Things changed when they realized he had a chance to win in 2024. Why do you think it took so long to prosecute him for jan 6th and Georgia? Its because they were hoping to not have to go this route. 

-They opened a huge can of worms going after an ex president and Trump will retaliate against many of them and put them in prison if elected. This is the number 1 reason he will never win. They will do whatever it takes to get him off the ballot if there is even a 1% chance he could win. 

-Also, the elite know he will end democracy and that is bad for business and takes away their power. America is a country built on money and power. The people winning the game control the rules and they don't want this to change. Trump has zero chance of becoming president again and either won't be alive by the time the election happens, won't be on every swing state ballot he needs, or will drop out from the threats from the elite.

- If the elite don't take care of him. The CIA will. They do not want Trump to hand Ukraine to Russia and then have them attack Poland, Finland and other countries. They don't want him helping all of our enemies again either. 

They will let Trump grift a little longer, but everyone in ""the know"" already knows he will not be a real candidate in 2024.",2023-12-02T08:14:48+00:00,t3_187x3td

Oh do fuck off.
If anything is certain about the middle east it's that no one is 'Clearly in the right'. There's blood on everyone's hands.

Like Northern Ireland, each side have legitimate grievances and no one has a monoply on suffering.

That said, Israel is acting with impunity right now. They offer platitudes towards peace every so often and then carry on bulldozing homes and adding to settlements that are illegal under international law. The settlers frequently attack palestinians with security forces watching on, burning families out of their homes - sometimes with them still inside...

europe,comment,Israel,k7i1rof,budgefrankly,,"Facile nonsense. 

Ireland’s last 60 years have been absorbed by trying to find and keep justice for a (until recently) oppressed minority (Catholics in Northern Ireland) whilst simultaneously criticising terrorists (the IRA) ostensibly supporting the same aim. 

This isn’t particularly new: the troubles saw the movement for equality in Northern Ireland fractured between the peaceful SDLP party and the nationalist and pro-violence Sinn Féin party. 

Likewise in the 1910s, there were differences between Home Rule supporters and the nationalist supporters like the IRB. The former of course were betrayed by the British Army mutiny which implicitly endorsed and encouraged newly formed unionist militias like the UVF. 

So for anyone who grew up in Ireland it’s pretty easy to comprehend that Hamas doesn’t represent all Palestinians, and that all Palestinians, and their children, don’t deserve to be punished for what Hamas did. It’s also easy to see and empathise with the degree to which people have had, and are still having, their homes taken away from them by an occupier. Finally, it’s clear — given Ireland’s sorry history of sectarian conflict — that discrimination based on religion, no matter what the history, is not a means to build an equitable and peaceful future.",2023-11-02T13:00:36+00:00,t1_k7hnj5r

So, Israel says they're going to raid Al-Shifa, 5 days ago. Hamas decide, in a fit of sheer desperate stupidity, that they're going to fight it out in and around the place. There has been exchanges of gunfire, right? There has been prepared fighting, right? I don't remotely understand how your comment above points to anything that might be off about what's been maybe or maybe not legitinately found. In those 5 days, a bunch of Hamas folks could have just decided: ""this MRI facility is innactive, the area is abandoned, let's stash weapons here."" And thus, after the raid by the IDF was conplete, they might have just found such a stash.

Obviously this needs to be verified and the truth needs to be properly found, and again, it excuses *piss all* of what the IDF have done: clear cut war crimes. That said, how is this *completely implausible* a find, given the circumstances?",2023-11-15T22:17:24+00:00,t1_k9f0ojt
