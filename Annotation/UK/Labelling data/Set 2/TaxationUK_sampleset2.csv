ukpolitics,post,tax rate,ffh5g2,callingacab,We're learning the wrong lessons from New Labour,"Many commentators here and elsewhere are adamant that Labour can only win the next election by returning to a more moderate program, or to what some describe as the “political centre”. This planar way of viewing politics is neither constructive nor accurate in any way - it severely lacks any nuance. Need I remind you how some of the Lib Dems' best electoral performances were during the New Labour years? Logic dictates that a centrist Labour Party should have cannibalised them.

Some clever people are frothing at the bit to bring up Labour's Militant years with Foot as a parallel to how a ""leftist cult"" condemned Labour to losing all those years ago. However, let's not forget the fact that his successor, aka the moderate Kinnock, also lost 2 successive elections, one of which was to John Major (the Theresa May of a past time). 

So what did Blair do that Kinnock didn't?

New Labour was an exercise in branding, first and foremost. It really was an overhaul of the party's image - at the turn of the millennium they were able to reinvent themselves as modern, metropolitan, cool etc - thus capturing the mood of a generation. Not only that, but they knew how to play the game - Campbell and Mandelson were ruthless when it came to spin in the media and were able to rival the Tories' network. Their policies were straightforward and focused to key policy areas with simple soundbites that resonated with the general public. We also can't forget how Blair sold his soul to the devil - by courting the baron Rupert Murdoch, who demanded from Blair that Britain would never rejoin the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in exchange for his support. But that's getting away from the point.

These tactics are not exclusive to the moderate wing of the party, though I do believe that those closer to the left may be inclined to look down on spin and salesmen tactics as the kind of slick politicking that they rail against. But I believe that this is where the party must compromise - not necessarily on matters of policy (though there is room for discussion) but on presentation. Jeremy Corbyn was a bleeding heart who couldn't understand how others didn't see the world the same way as him (full disclosure: I am the same). He thought tales of austerity and homelessness would be enough to win the hearts of swing voters, as he had done with the Labour membership. In an ideal world this would be the case, but this was not enough when we were already fighting an uphill battle. 

Some are convinced that pushing the Overton Window can only happen by starting in the centre and pushing leftwards from government. Blair it seems made no effort to accomplish this. And therein lies one of the main issues with New Labour - rather than trying to redefine the political landscape, it simply fought elections on Thatcher's terms. We all know how she described New Labour as her ""greatest achievement"". Blair had an opportunity to create a new political consensus based on community, social justice, putting people before profits etc. Instead, he consolidated the grip of Thatcherism on our system – individualism and corporate greed.  By endorsing Blair all the way into 10 Downing Street, the right-wing press played an absolute blinder - by legitimising a neoliberal Labour Party as the only true ""viable"" opposition, they would ensure that Labour could never appoint someone who would actually fight their hegemonic business interest in the world of media. 

The moderates in the party seem to fundamentally misunderstand how Blair actually came to power, as evidenced by their constant undermining of Corbyn's leadership [every single day](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/21/peter-mandelson-i-try-to-undermine-jeremy-corbyn-every-day). Rather than rallying behind a popular leader they decided to backstab him (or front stab if you're Jess Phillips) by resigning from his unity cabinets, challenging him in leadership elections etc. Through hubris, they fulfilled their own prophecy of Corbyn's unelectability. And they were unable to provide an alternative vision for Labour, presumably since many of them had no guiding principles or beliefs - they only sought to relive the glorious noughties whilst simultaneously criticising Corbyn for being stuck in the past himself, albeit in the 1980s. Those years saw some of Labour's worst performances - especially in 1983. The moderates back then wholly abandoned Foot's Labour to form the SDP, who joined up with the Liberals and doubled their vote share. Who knows what might have happened if the moderates stayed as a united front on the left? It seems like this is a common occurrence amongst the centrists in the Labour Party - they are unable to cope with not being in charge and ending up wrecking the party's chances. Yet the Left never abandoned the Labour Party en masse, not even after New Labour and Iraq. What I found abhorrent this past week was those critics on the right of the party saying that Momentum and the left had “failed those who needed a Labour government” implying that we had blood on our hands as a result of our “ideological purity testing”. Yet the moderates were all too ready to throw those same people under the bus with their austerity manifestoes in 2010 and 2015. And how can they blame the loss on the Left when it was those same moderates who were pushing for the second referendum that lost us key seats? 

I hope this gives you all an insight into why those of us on the left are hesitant at the calls for moderation. We’re not idealistic, navel-gazing students who all forgot about Blair winning elections. Our left-wing policies are popular, reasonable and credible; we just need to be able to sell them to the public. After all, it is their tax money we are spending. 

TLDR: People can't be defined on a left-right axis - People don't necessarily know what they want from politics - New Labour were salesmen who knew how to sell policies you didn't know you wanted - Current Labour are in a bubble where the policies sell themselves - Moderate politics are not inherently easier to sell to the public (Kinnock, Brown and Miilband lost 4 elections total, whereas Corbyn and Foot have only lost 3 between them)",2020-03-08T18:59:58+00:00,

tories,comment,income tax,ftaoeij,Blakajac,," **Climate Change.**

> Do you feel the conservative party is doing enough to prepare or mitigate and lead? What policy would you advocate?

No, but some of the work being done is good. 

The energy markets have been nudged in the right direction and we are less rellianton fossil fuels for electricity than before, gas will be harder to replace though. This will likely require investment in better energy storage infrastructure, and there doesn't seem to be the willpower or incentive for this currently, one policy area that I would work on.

The flip side is that we are still not doing very well with transport and in the home energy use, driving cars and burning gas to heat leaky homes. To combat this I think we need to pull a classic Tory move and nick a few opponent policies on housing improvement and public transport (particularly rural bus support), both of these would also help those on lower incomes quality of life and opportunity. The combustion engine ban is a good step, but we need to get electric charging infrastructure  rolled out more quickly, particularly for homes and workplaces.

>An economy that grows 3% every year doubles in size in 25 years, do you think we can continue to expect to grow the economy in light of climate change? If so, how?

The UK has quite a service based industry, and digital/tech industries are growing. It will be hard to get everyone to pivot from fast fashion and throwaway consumerism but societal changes are happening. The energy market changes I mentioned should help the digital sector grow without parallel emissions. I don't think we can be 100% sustainable with growth as we need to vastly improve the reuse/reclaim/recycle structure of the economy, but we could be worse placed too.

**Wealth Inequality and Billionaires / Multinational Corporations.**

>How do you feel about the existence of billionaires and their contribution to the economy / the public purse, and from a moral point of view?

I'm not too fussed about inequality, the more important metric for me is eliminating poverty. High earners/spenders contribute lots in taxes (and some of them through philanthropy), and many fortunes will have been earned through hard work and risk. One thing that does concern me though is the power of ridiculously large/powerful companies, although the CMA does a fairly good job with traditional businesses e.g. ASDA/Sainsbury's, the tech companies are a different kettle of fish.

>What if anything, would you like to see the conservative party do regarding the ultrawealthy & multinational corporate tax avoidance?

Not sure on specific policy but it is a continuous cat and mouse situation to close the loopholes which will never end. Tax avoidance is fair game, tax evasion is not, international collaboration will be important to combat some elements.

**Automation.**

>How would you like to see society adjust to an economy that can support significantly fewer jobs?

Another difficult one, automation will also create new jobs in certain industries, so upskilling will be important, this is probably a weak point at the moment of the labour force, I think the Lib Dems had a policy of a skills budget or something. What we will need to do depends upon the rate and nature of changes, many jobs will still require the human element. If there is growth prospects/opportunity, businesses will identify what they need and that will guide the market.

I have considered the merits of UBI/negative tax, I think this could be a good way to A) reduce the inordinate bureaucracy of the welfare system and B) support a transitioning economy, but I don't think it would ever be a total substitute for work, and probably actually is more to do with welfare reform than automation, but that depends on the speed of change again.",2020-06-07T19:33:40+00:00,t3_gybrjg

It's not a perfect system by any means, and there's always some way you can take some data of some sort and construed it to be that the system is horrible.

It's an extremely self centered world in America. Everything is always about the individual rather than society at large. Their mental health system is dog shit, why? Because no one wants to pay for anyone else, they don't seem to realise though that having a system paid for by taxes isn't going to be a whole lot different than just paying health insurance for a large chunk of people, but for a lot, it will be a whole lot better.

The difference is, in England, you pay your taxes, and if anything at all happens, you have medical coverage. In America, there's a whole laundry list of things that the Insurance companies will do to get out of paying, even things that aren't related - like, you break your leg in a car crash, but you failed to mention that you got a sprained wrist when you were 5, so your insurance is invalid, and you have to fork out thousands of dollars anyway.

We have such little control over google and our daily workplace/employers - and what the EU demands in exchange for its benefits and membership of the club seem paltry by comparison! "" - Fair enough.  We'll just have to disagree here.  If the goal is for greater integration (which has been stated as being the goal quite clearly before the migrant crisis) then legal supremacy creep is how they will achieve it.  Essentially I view the supremacy argument as a gateway to greater integration, and if I dislike the EU now, then greater integration is the last thing id want.  Hence this becomes forefront.

While I may not like the existing government (I dont) and there is a good discussion to be had as to whether it needs reform.  There is no way that I would pick another government structure which I also think needs reform, and add it on top of the existing behemoth we already have.  The chance of any actual reform taking place reduces the further away you step from the system.  So I do not see the additional system of the EU as a solution.

Edit: I do think you're right about immigration simply being filled by alternate means.  Hopefully in the mean time they'll sort out the mess to vocational qualifications in the country so we can reduce reliance on foreign labour (im not holding my breath though)

I have lost every ounce of respect for Keir Starmer. At a time where we need a radical leader he is wet and pathetic.

His cabinet are the same.

His back tracking on rent controls and reinstating DfID has been the nail in the coffin.

As it stands I'll be voting Lib Dem. I'm in a safe Labour seat so it'll be more of a protest vote than one likely to bring change, but I can't bring myself to vote Labour again.

Lib Dem policies include:
- Rejoining the single market.
- Electoral reform (PR).
- Raising taxes on energy companies and passing it onto consumers.
- Energy support for small businesses.
- Tax water companies to pay for sewage clean up.
- Repealing Tory anti-protest laws.

ukpolitics,comment,VAT,i414mwq,passingconcierge,,"Clothing and shoes for young children have been charged a zero rate of VAT since the introduction of the tax on 1 April 1973.

There is no definition of the term ""young children"" in VAT law. Instead, the VAT relief is based on the maximum size an average child will be on their 14th birthday. Coincidentally the minimum age you could leave school in April 1973.

Clothes for children at school, over 14, as well as many larger than average children, are taxed at 20%. This includes school uniform.

The Government of 1973 is responsible for VAT on school uniforms.
