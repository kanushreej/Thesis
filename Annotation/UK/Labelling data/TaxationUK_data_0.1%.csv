next one will be tomorrow but not released to the public for  a few days. 

they just widen the range when the have lower numbers to work with. There were 231 total case in July but the R Paper of 21 July had ""Current estimate of R (new positive tests): 0.9 – 1.5 ""

The thing to look out for later in the week when it is publish; 

"" First COVID +ve hospital admission in last week:""  - This is the number of admissions that excludes those who acquired COVID while in hospital. For the RP Paper on 23rd March this was 40 and the number of admissions in the previous 7 days was 59 which implies 19 infections in hospital - 32% of all admissions

and

""Number of community acquired COVID inpatients:"" - on 23rd we had 154 total but only 105 community acquired. That means 31.8% of those in hospital got it while already there or tested positive upon admission for something other than COVID.",2021-03-29 16:01:55+00:00

Scotland,comment,bank,jz5hv62,TheFirstMinister,,"Without a UK ""footprint"" obtaining a mortgage will be difficult - but not impossible.  Your deposit would have to be sizeable and the interest rate will be on the high side.  As your German credit score will carry no weight in the UK market you will need to bring as much cash to the table as possible.

The UK market is largely sentiment rather than data driven which leads to irrational behavior by both sellers and buyers.

Sales data is out-of-date - 6+ - 9+ months - so obtaining comparable sales data to determine local market prices is a challenge.

Searching for homes by sq/m / sq/ft is not a thing in the UK which, BTW, is completely asinine but is it what it is.

Homes will *possibly* be of poorer quality than what you are used to.  Insulation, for example, was for a long time considered to be an optional extra. The housing stock can be very old indeed. Heating some of these older homes can be expensive.

Estate Agents are largely clueless about the house they're selling, local area, the competition, etc.  When dealing with them remember the First Rule Of Property:  Everybody Lies.  The Second Rule Of Property is this: refer back to Rule #1.

House prices are *generally speaking* declining due to high ('er than usual) interest rates and lower home affordability.  However, property is hyper, hyper local so relying on national - or regional - trend data is foolish. It's a street-by-street affair. And even though prices are falling, a lot of the stock is garbage being dumped by landlords who want to put their money elsewhere or are probate sales following the death of aged parents and whose homes haven't been upgraded in 30+ years.  The good stuff carries a premium and is still getting a lot of attention from buyers (cash buyers, especially).  St. Andrews which you mentioned should continue to hold up despite price falls elsewhere.

There's a lot of \*bad\* info./advice out there (again, it's a sentiment rather than data driven market) and the pitfalls are many.  You may be best served finding an independent Buyer's Agent to conduct the search on your behalf and guide you through the process.

Again, however, the biggest issue I see is obtaining financing.  You could be looking at a cash buy only.",2023-09-04 21:57:20+00:00

Although it wasn't as exciting as listening to UK politicians and negotiators.  

I think the EU will respond to this crisis like other similar crises. It will be boring, but the EU will write laws and regulations that will cause the UK such economic damage that the UK will return to the negotiating table. Despite the fact that the UK still has many things to negotiate with the EU. Since the UK EU negotiations have not ended, I am not surprised that the situation in Northern Ireland is still returning. Because it's the only really strong card the UK has in this negotiation. The threat of peace in Ireland was one of the strongest UK cards. That's why it will never be solved.  

But I think the UK underestimates the possibility that the situation in Ireland may get out of hand. And people really start to die.",2021-03-17 15:08:53+00:00

Also, the border conflict is also the only thing stopping Transnistria from uniting with Russia (which Transnistria wants), in which case Moldova would be bordering Russia, putting itself at risk of a russian invasion if it doesn't manage to unite with Romania faster than Transnistria unites with Russia. And Moldova has no chance in a war against Russia alone, unlike Ukraine.

And no, Transnistria was only part of Romania for the few year period in ww2 when Romania pushed the USSR past Crimeea using german weapons. It was not part of greater Romania.

And nothing changes the fact that Moldova is an artificial state made from territory and a populace stolen from Romania with some deported russians to make it look like it is different, when in reality it's blatantly a part of Romania just like east Germany was a part of west Germany.

The fact that Moldova exists is living proof of how Russia oppressed and oppresses Romania. And the fact that there are people like you who try to argue that it isn't the same as east Germany proves how efficient the russian propaganda machine is.",2024-04-26 11:36:32+00:00

The deal essentially was PO Ltd. would provide the operating capital for the business free of charge but the SPM would be liable for any shortfall.  The SPM would also receive a fixed annual amount for operating the office, as well as a commission-based amount that varied depending on the trade they did. Any staff salaries, utilities, rent, etc. were their responsibility to cover. They were essentially contractors, and PO Ltd. retained the right to terminate the contract at any time.

The serious problems came about when PO Ltd. believed the data too well, refused to admit there could be any error in Horizon, terminated contracts of SPMs then used the Proceeds of Crime Act to pursue SPMs through the court system to recover claimed losses.  SPMs would lose access to Horizon as soon as their contract was terminated, so they had very little evidence to present in their favour, and PO Ltd. refused to share any evidence with the defence that may have allowed SPMs and their legal teams to exonerate themselves.

Automation sounds great! But the UK is a service economy, not a manufacturing one. The gains without substantially redirecting the economy are unfortunately small. You're also asking the state to start picking winners in industry. That's not usually worked out well.   


Similarly, a huge UK industry is higher education, and while net-zero over time, expanding that industry has meant a growing foreign student population. 


But that doesn't mean we can't do better with immigration policy. For instance, we'd much prefer migrants who came over when young, did some work, and then left instead of bringing over all their dependents and staying.

Because if their argument is that trains are slow - you sort of have to ask slower than what?

Someone said communism had no success. A reasonable reply is to wonder what success is and what exactly that looks like right now under our system. Because hidden in the ""no success"" criticism is the idea that things are better now.

Then the defence often becomes ""capitalism is the only one we can be trusted with"" or some other nonsense.

ukpolitics,post,credit,14upqpt,da96whynot,Lessons from the IRA - Why Keir Starmer will struggle to spend his £28bn,"Recently, there was a lot of complaining about Rachel Reeves saying that the Labour Party would not be able to spend £28bn a year in every year of the upcoming parliament, but would instead have to ramp up to it.

&#x200B;

This was widely touted as a U-Turn across the press, which was quite shocking to me as I didn’t realise people thought that it was possible to spend this money well from Day 1.

&#x200B;

This spending will take YEARS to properly ramp up to decent levels IMO. Because that’s how the British state works.I (a non expert) wanted to take some time explaining why it will be nearly impossible to spend this money quickly and well, based on what we already know of govt processes and what we have seen from the Inflation Reduction Act in the US.

&#x200B;

**Step 1** \- Write a budgetAs Labour are not currently in power, they do not have the resources to be able to draft a full budget. They will claim that their policies are costed, but they have not been through the rigour (both good and bad) that the treasury and OBR will do.The first step will be to spell out in a lot of detail how they want this money spent, how to allocate between:Renewables such as 

1) Wind/Solar

2) Insulation and home and commercial property improvements

3) Technology investments such as Hydrogen

4) Climate adaptation measures such as air-cons

5) Nuclear (if that is part of this plan at all, or if it comes separate)

&#x200B;

**Step 2**\-  How will you spend itOnce you’v figured out what you want to spend it on, you then need to figure out how, will you do it through grants to households, tax credits to companies, set up your own solar fitting company and employ local people in every area.

What will be the rules around where this is manufactured, will it all be in the UK, how much can / should we procure from overseas. Is it more important to move fast and build stuff, or move slower but have our own set of skills in building it.

All of this will need to be ironed out, some of it can be done in chunks, for example you can say Year 1 we will only focus on grants, but you’re gonna struggle to spend 28bn this way

&#x200B;

**Step 3**\- Pass the budgetThis bits easy once you’ve done the above and had it costed by the treasury and checked by the OBR, you pass the bill. This will also take a while, the last Finance bill started in the house 21st of March, and got royal ascent on the 11th of July.

&#x200B;

By this point, you are looking at 6 months just to get the legislative framework in place.

**Step 4-** The fine print. 

Once you’re in govt you realise 2 things, 1 it can move very fast according to its own stopwatch, and very slow by everyone else’s standard. This is primarily because the govt has so many rules around how it spends money.

This is to avoid waste, but also avoid bad headlines such as “Govt. gave loan to wind farm construction firm that went bankrupt 2 days later”.

So once you actually have the money approved you need to write and implement the fine print. How will people get the money, can we scale existing channels, do we need new ones?Every new channel will require a team of people to figure out appropriate safeguards, KPIs, ways to make sure it’s available equally etc. 

This is all assuming it’s done centrally, if it’s done locally you will have 300 councils trying to do the same for their own area

&#x200B;

**Step 4**\- Get the money out the door 

Ok, so you have the money approved by parliament, you know what you want to spend it on, you know how to spend it.

Let’s assume you’ve taken the easy path of basically offering grants and tax breaks for certain kinds of spending, you now have a new set of challenges:

1) Wait for projects to get planning permission (this is where this legislation will fail)

2) Wait for the projects to be built, or have the construction/engineering capability in place to start building (shovel ready if you will)

3) Look at the plans, scrutinise each application

4) Approve/Deny and send the money

&#x200B;

I hope people realise, that this is a short summary of what is going to have to happen before we start spending this money. These are things that have to happen with every bit of legislation.",2023-07-09 05:13:50+00:00

A simple example is free school meals. It was previously tied to specific benefits. But with UC, there is no specific metric. So you have to go on benefit levels. But then you either end up with a massive increase in the program or cause a lot of kids to lose their free meals, which is not an easy problem to solve.

unitedkingdom,post,debt,1cnsa3w,CreativismUK,DfE “Safety Valve” scheme causing major damage to our schools and children,"I’m writing this because I find this whole thing completely shocking and, because it’s been done so quietly, most people are completely unaware of it. 

Safety Valve is a Department for Education scheme which forces cash-strapped councils to severely cut their spending on special educational provision, take money from mainstream school budgets towards these increased costs, and place more disabled children in mainstream schools without the support they need. This obviously has a giant impact on all schools and all children, not only those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).

Many local authorities have giant debts related to education - some over £100m - putting many LAs at risk of bankruptcy when the debt override ends in 2026. DfE’s solution to this is to get LAs to sign agreements that they’ll severely cut spending, and divert funds away from school budgets, in order to get a bit of the money they should have had in the first place, and only if they meet agreed targets for cuts.

The Safety Valve agreements state that the LA must cut their spending and meet targets for doing so - in return, they’ll get a contribution towards their overspend each year of the agreement.

For most people, the part that affects them is that mainstream schools now have less money, which means fewer resources - an academy chain in Norfolk who are [getting rid of primary teaching assistants](https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/24280746.norfolks-wensum-trust-plans-scrap-teaching-assistants/), for example. Mainstream schools are also being asked to do the impossible and educate more children with disabilities, with less money and resources. 

DfE are approving the [diversion of funds](https://schoolsweek.co.uk/send-high-needs-revealed-councils-slice-67m-from-school-budgets-to-prop-up-deficits/) away from mainstream school budgets towards their overspend. Some schools are now below he minimum per pupil funding level - how are they supposed to function like that?

The reason for the debt is that LAs have the statutory duty to make provision for children with special educational needs and disabilities, but nowhere near enough funding to provide what’s set out in the law. LAs have been failing in those duties for a long time - parents can then appeal, and [98% of the time](https://www.specialneedsjungle.com/send-tribunal-2023-councils-stop-wasting-public-funds-send-appeals-fail-almost-all-time/) they are successful because the law hasn’t been followed, so the LA has to pay for it anyway. This government has also failed to provide enough funding to set up more specialist schools to meet the growing need for specialist places so many children are placed in independent or charity-run schools. 

[38 local authorities](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-very-high-deficit-intervention)have signed up to these “Safety Valve” agreements - the crux of them is that LAs must cut their spending on SEND provision over several years until they are no longer overspending. Some LAs are overspending by £40m a year currently because that’s what the provision costs. Govt could recognise the funding isn’t sufficient, invest more into early intervention, better support for mainstream schools but they’re not doing that. Instead they’re holding LAs to ransom and getting them to sign agreements that essentially require them to fail vulnerable children and ignore their statutory duties. 

One of the ways they plan to cut spending is to issue fewer statutory plans and place more children with plans in mainstream schools. That means many more children with additional needs with no funded support in mainstream classrooms while they see their budgets cut. How is that going to work? There’s all this press about attendance and behaviour - what do they think the outcome of this will be? 

Several LAs have already failed to meet their targets so aren’t even getting the carrot of a bit of extra money. 

The whole situation is absolutely shocking, and the way it has been done - behind closed doors and with the actual proposals made exempt from public scrutiny in almost every case - only makes matters worse. There is a parliamentary petition against this scheme and asking government to resolve the deficits - https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/659401

There hasn’t been a huge amount of mainstream national news coverage because people think it only affects children with SEND and not their child / school but that’s not the case. There’s plenty of local coverage in the affected areas. Here’s some national coverage of the transfers: https://schoolsweek.co.uk/school-leaders-rebel-over-raid-on-reserves-amid-shameful-bail-out-ultimatum/

In the end, nothing forces you to take on credit.

I am not making a judgement as to “fault” for your own indebtedness, but just noting that you don’t actually have to take on credit If you are repeatedly not in a position to pay it. The debt collectors don’t chase you for fun, they do it because you took on credit you were not in a position to cover. 


Either way, the debt collectors did not put you in debt. For that you can blame the company giving your credit you cannot afford.

Effectively what she's saying is that the legal route out of the EU via International Law, Article 50 included in Lisbon Treaty as a consequence, will be made to be as difficult and full of obstacles as possible for nations that would wish an alternative relationship with the EU based on Free Trade (as EFTA(3/4) currently enjoys via it's EEA(31) agreement with the rest of the EU(28).

Instead implicit are 2 things:-

1. A Better Deal = Fallacy because it will be attractive to other EU members which the EU does not want as part of it's Centralization process towards the EZ members.
2. But that plays both ways: If the above is too ambitious, then playing by the rules and dealing fairly as equals via Article 50 should be as per the RULES agreed and laid down and written into the Treaties must therefore be the **""HUMBLE""** route to a choice of a member that it no-longer wishes to be part of the supranational contruct.

It seems to me The EU according to Mrs. Bearder is trying to have it both ways! And this is perhaps the most pernicious principle of political membership of the EU that I can deduct. This coercive-abusive relationship that leads to deception of the true purpose of the EU for so long, the degradation of democracy and the ever growing illegitimacy of governance by the government over the governed.

If you want unending uncertainty then here is the root of it. I would suspect that ordinary people intuit this type of relationship and hence why more MEP's are UKIP or eurosceptic MEP's and why the Lib Dems are down to their final and last MEP who still practices the true faith of the EU Supranational political ever closer union.

The end of globalization. It really is the entire world's socio-economic system changing in the next few decades and it's come all at once.

europe,comment,estate,f5stpe1,duisThias,,"If that's true, that people are irrationally buying up properties to rent them, then you guys should have artificially-low rents and losing money on owning rentals -- people hell-bent on buying should be forcing the price-to-rent ratio up.

https://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Europe/Ireland/price-rent-ratio

Instead of topping the list, Ireland is near the *bottom* of the list for Europe, at 14 years, which would be exceptionally low by US standards and indicate that there is very high demand for rentals versus available rental properties relative to purchasers versus available buyable properties.  If purchase prices are going up, rental prices are probably going up *even more*.

I'd suggest that perhaps those high Dublin prices have more to do with several factors:

* [**Urbanization**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization).  Normally in modern economies, the countryside becomes mostly-depopulated and people move into cities.  Ireland is reasonably well-to-do, yet has [one of the least-urbanized populations in the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_countries_by_percentage_of_urban_population), which leaves a lot of room for even her *own* population to move into cities.

* **Concentration of population in the capital**.  I've pointed out in the past that in Europe, unlike in the US, it is nearly always the case that the capital of a country is the largest and economically-most-important city.  Dublin is [by far the largest city in Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_urban_areas_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland_by_population), so there's really only one option for decent-sized cities.

* **Natural population growth**.  Unlike most of Europe, Ireland maintained strong population growth for a long time, and was one of the final countries in Europe to see her total fertility rate drop below 2.1; she continues to have the EU's second-highest TFR after France.  Her population would continue to naturally grow for some time.  More people means more demand for housing.

* **Immigration**.  Ireland speaks English.  The EU will speak English as its interchange language.  In some other countries, the locals are going to be more-pissed about people just speaking English -- I remember this article from a bit back, ""[German minister lashes out at English-speaking waiters in Berlin](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/germany-berlin-english-speaking-waiters-minister-jens-spahn-finance-cdu-a7894436.html)"".  In Ireland, if you know English, you've also got enough to handle everything -- taxes, traveling through the countryside, filling out forms, whatever -- and people aren't going to get pissed off at you (at least over English).  Ireland is one of only three member states in the EU that has English as an official language, and with Brexit it is the largest-remaining and wealthiest, which makes for a very easy place to migrate to for citizens of EU members leveraging freedom of movement of labor.  For perspective, Ireland is seeing a higher rate of net migration than is the ""country of immigrants"" United States today:

    https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ei.html

    >  4 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)

    https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html

    >  3.8 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)

    By comparison, Germany -- another popular destination country in the EU -- [is at a mere 1.5/1,000 population](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html).

    All of those new immigrants need housing.

* **Housing regulations**.  Apparently Dublin has historically had regulations that limited its buildings to be extremely short, so it wasn't able to expand upwards, have skyscrapers popping up and whatnot.  It sounds like this being an issue has gone all the way up to the Taoiseach's level, and Ireland *just* relaxed a ton of building height caps in Ireland at the beginning of 2018...but those take a while to have effect, because buildings don't instantly become invested in, planned, constructed, sold, and all that overnight.

    https://www.irishtimes.com/business/construction/government-plans-to-lift-building-height-restrictions-1.3253589

    > The Government hopes to pass new laws lifting height restrictions on residential buildings by the end of the year, according to Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar.
    > 
    > His colleague, the Minister for Housing, Eoghan Murphy, has already signalled that the Government plans to remove the restrictions, seen as a barrier to tackling the Republic’s housing crisis in its cities.
    >
    > Addressing the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) annual conference in Dublin on Thursday, Mr Varadkar confirmed that his administration intends lifting the restrictions in city centres and along key transport routes.
    > 
    > Such a move will require the Government to introduce legislation and the Oireachtas to pass it.

Half of Europe was 'saved by stalin' the other half by the commonwealth and US.

Tbf most of the gold we took from Europe just before the nazis came but Of course American govt bankrupted us (they would only accept gold because the £ would be worthless if Britain was invaded) and they could have traded with the nazis instead and made much more money.
 But that doesn't wipe out the fact that America only came to the European war to help Britain liberate Europe (if not they would've only gone to war with Japan). They would not have come if Britain wasn't in the war. The first years of the war they refused to fight for another European war but were impressed by British resilience. Thousands of American came to our island and from there they marched through Western Europe and killed and died together, iwould consider that a pretty special relationship.

Sex (female/male) is determined by biological features, chromosomes, sexual organs etc. and gender (woman/man) is determined by social factors.

It was in fact the femmenist movement that pushed for the sex/gender distinction in the 80s, to combat biological determinism. This has however led to the idea of *gender realism*, the idea that there must be a common feature or experience that defines a woman, and that all women are different to all men. This idea suggests that because the only features that are unique to women and common to all women are biological, that sex must be gender and gender must be sex.

brexit,comment,income,jdum96y,barryvm,,"> Not all people from Britain and NI live there. What Brexit has produced is a situation where some Britons have to choose their identity and association. It didn't work for some who are in the EU and EEA trying to be sovereign citizens, but for the ones where it did, it allows an even more critical eye from the inside about what happens and what needs to be done. Some of us have already gone through the Ausstieg from the UK and its looniness, though we're still affected by it. 

I see what you mean, and apologize if I caused offense by generalizing. It is difficult to avoid when there are so many possible different situations and edge cases, which in itself points out the obvious problems with policies such as Brexit in the first place.

> This is why the posts you see about rejoin are completely in a vacuum and people believe all they have to do is get a concensus and that's it. Even here the British keep saying ""the EU is dying to take us back"" or the people that are immigrants, but don't see themselves as such say the same shit regarding residency, citizenships, and so on. 

I agree, actually. Most posts don't really reflect that ""rejoining"" has no legal or political basis. ""joining"" does, but it is a long political and diplomatic process where maintaining political and popular consensus is merely the starting condition. That said, outside the citizenship implications the choice is not a binary one between EU membership and increasing divergence. I'd say the most realistic outcome is somewhere between the two.

> The UK is a disaster that never looked right and looks even less right now and learning and self-reflection is not as ingrained in the culture as leading with britishness, entitlement, and exceptionalism are.

Are these actually that ingrained? They obviously are within the UK political system and the rhetoric it peddles, but is that reflected in the general population? It's not in the people I know who originate from the UK but then that could be selection bias. In general, though, among every people you have those who think theirs is special. The fact that they all do this means none of them really are. The only real difference seems to be how good certain politicians are at exploiting these sentiments. Constitutionally and politically, I'd have to agree the UK is a mess, but then those things are social constructs that can be fixed if people really want that to happen.

> The UK is not showing it has used the last three years to learn and self-reflect. It is simply moving on and diverging politically and psychologically.

Is that not mostly because the UK's political system refuses to engage with the problem? People might not care enough to force a change, but that doesn't mean they don't care or that this will remain the case. Politically, I think the cause is lost for at least a decade. UK politicians have, to borrow a phrase, ""learned nothing and forgotten nothing"". They're back where they started in 2016 in many ways, and all the old grievances (real or imagined) will be unearthed the moment any of them think it politically advantageous to do so. Whether they will have the same purchase as before remains to be seen.",2023-03-27 09:27:18+00:00

northernireland,post,income,170n01c,Ah_here_like,Irish unity poll ruled out by Sir Keir Starmer if he becomes PM,"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67020960

A referendum on Irish unification is ""not even on the horizon"" according to the man who is favourite to be the next UK prime minister.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer spoke to the BBC before his party conference, which begins at the weekend.

He has previously said he would campaign for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK if such a referendum was held in his lifetime.
Those remarks were recently criticised by his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn.

Now, Sir Keir has ruled out calling a poll if he becomes prime minister.

""I don't think we're anywhere near that kind of question,"" he told BBC News NI.

""It's absolutely hypothetical. It's not even on the horizon.""

Sir Keir has also spoken of renegotiating an improved trade deal with the European Union if he wins power, leading to speculation such an arrangement may do away with the need for an Irish Sea border.

The post-Brexit trade border, which led to extra checks on goods imported to Northern Ireland from Great Britain, led to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) boycotting the Stormont institutions.

This has left Northern Ireland without a devolved government since February 2022.
But he flatly ruled out a Swiss-style deal which would see the UK adhering to EU rules with the oversight of the European Court of Justice.
'Step in the right direction'

""I'm not interested in a deal that puts the UK in a position of being a rule taker,"" Sir Keir said.
""Our rules must be made in Westminster, according to the national interest of the UK as a whole.

""I am interested in resolving some of the outstanding issues. And obviously, that will mean making progress on things like the Windsor [Framework] agreement - the protocol - because that was a step in the right direction, which is why we said we would support it.

""So it's quite clear that there can be improvements and I think in Northern Ireland in particular, there will be a lot of interest in whether we cannot have some measures which take away some of these still remaining tensions that are very obviously there.""

Some senior members of the DUP are known to be in favour of waiting to see if they may get a better deal from an incoming Labour administration than the current Conservative government.

But Sir Keir made it clear he believed the Stormont institutions should be back up and running immediately.

Sir Keir Starmer visited Stormont in June 2022
""We've talked to all the political parties in Northern Ireland, as you know, and as you would expect, so I'm well aware of the issues the DUP have and I think there are ways to resolve them,"" he said.

""The wrong thing to do is to simply say there are issues that need resolving. The right thing to do is to get in the room and resolve.

""There's one further thing that I think is important. I did work in Northern Ireland for five years, with the Policing Board and the police service, and I know that the role of the UK government as honest broker is crucial in finding agreement, where it may not appear it's there initially.

""I'm worried that our government has moved away from that honest broker role.""

Sir Keir added that Northern Ireland's government needed to be restored quickly because communities here ""absolutely depend on the decisions that have to be made with their interests at heart"".

""And are we talking to all the political parties about this? You bet we are, to ensure that that can happen as quickly as possible.""

He repeated his intention to repeal the controversial Troubles Legacy Bill after his new shadow Northern Ireland spokesman Hilary Benn said a replacement must be found.

""I do think that we need to look at what the other options are. Of course, I do understand the problem we're trying to confront,"" Sir Keir said.

""We're talking to political parties about what that might look like. But if I know anything about Northern Ireland it's that you don't sit in London imposing things on Northern Ireland if you do not have the support of the political parties or the communities.""

Asked if he had a specific idea he replied: ""I have got some ideas about how we take that forward.

""Obviously, these are difficult matters. If they were not difficult they'd have been solved many years ago, but I was personally involved in my work in Northern Ireland, with some of the investigations into these historic cases.
""And I met the victims groups even more recently to talk through their experience of what they want. But what I would do is bring a collaborative approach that brings people with us on a journey rather than impose it.""

UK-Irish leaders meet in Spain

Meanwhile Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar spoke about the lack of devolution when they met in Spain during a session of the European Political Community.

In a statement released afterwards, a Number 10 spokesperson said the leaders had ""shared their concerns"" about the continued absence of an executive in Northern Ireland.

They also talked about the legacy act as well as the UK and Ireland's joint bid to host the Euros in 2028.

An Irish government spokesman said the leaders also ""discussed the importance of Irish-British bilateral relationships, including the positive indications regarding the Euro 2028 bid"", adding that Mr Varadkar said Ireland was ""happy to assist financially in redeveloping Casement Park in Belfast"".",2023-10-05 16:53:44+00:00

unitedkingdom,comment,income,jvaaf74,Hypno_Hamster,,"What? Use your brain.

Rent in Cornwall for a Flat is approx £1000 in Truro. A mortgage is £750 on the same property.

That's £250 profit for the landlord plus they are having their £750 mortgage paid off.

The renter gets zero. The landlord gets £1000 a month. 

The cost of running that property is no where near that.

When the landlord sells the property they get ALL of the mortgage back out of the house minus the interest.

It's very basic common sense

The only way I can think you might be confused is if you think that either.

A) The £750 is lost money (its not, its the renter paying the landlords debt for them)

It came to light that they couldn't track via credit cards to monitor how many tablets people were buying. They just didn't hold the data.

> No more than decimal points worth of inflation, if any. WE have lowered WTO tariffs since Brexit, we should be seeing cheaper produce from NZ/Aus shortly also.  


The EU accounts for half of our trade and since brexit it is now harder to trade with the EU, with increased bureacracy, tariffs and costs pushing the price of goods up.  


Around 2% of our trade is with australia/new zealand, any changes to tariffs there are minute and the cost of shipping goods half way around the planet is unlikely to be competitive. We also already had a trade deal with australia through the EU.

Why is 'greater equality' an absolute good? Surely it's a more achievable goal to try and ensure that everybody has a good quality of life, and the opportunity to develop their skills if they're capable of doing so?

Maybe that's what you mean, but when you frame it in terms of 'equality', it sounds like you'd see no difference between raising the very poorest up a notch and bringing the very richest down a notch. The same with wealth and opportunity - the children of the wealthy having greater opportunities than those of the poor only diminishes the latter insofar as the children of the poor are unable to compete with the children of the rich, somewhere down the road.

ukpolitics,post,inheritance,4m71sn,666michael,The Ladybird Book of the EU,"EU stands for European Union. A union is like a marriage: full of hatred, betrayal and depression. But you must hide these feelings for the greater good. 
You could try to hide something now - perhaps in the back of a lorry. 


The European Union has had many name changes; Common Market; EC, EEC, EU. In the same way that sweeties change names : Marathon to Snickers; Opal Fruits to Starburst and Dime to Daim. The new names are nicer and make everything better. 
Draw smiley faces. 


Being part of the EU means you will never be poor, unhappy, or discriminated against. Probably. 
It will cost a lot of money to feel this way - but money is not important, unless it is your money. 
Can you draw a euro coin? 


The EU is just like a big family. Some of them created you, and you love them unconditionally, unless there is no inheritance - then you consider murder or theft. Some of this family are your siblings - people you have much in common with, but would not want to be left alone with in a departure lounge. 
You could plan a trip to a departure lounge. There is one in Calais. 


Being part of the EU means your toaster is not a death trap and your fruit has a small angular specificity. You are meant to be pleased about this but just feel oppressed. Don't fret as these feelings will subside
and become a small elephant in the room. 
Try to draw an invisible elephant. 


The EU has many offices and people. They all need breakfast, lunch and dinner. And desks and computers. And travel. And assistants. And clothes. More people are needed to provide these things. They also need looking after. It's an amazing family where everyone is happy - as long as you live in Brussels. 
Would you like to live in Brussels? 


In the EU you are free to travel and work in any other EU country, although in practice you only move in a western direction. If you cannot work you can go there anyway and be given something called ""benefits"". If you have a cat, look at the cat - it is on benefits. 
Sometimes the cat tortures a mouse for your pleasure. 


The EU is a giant party where you can only come if you are invited. Like most parties you don't need to bring anything, or behave, or be nice. Or know anyone. And you can take home anything which will fit in your pockets. Let's all have a party. 


Sometimes you are allowed to vote about the EU. Voting is part of democracy. EU Democracy is different though. With EU democracy you are encouraged to vote to be part of a system where you are not allowed to vote for the people who run the system.

No ones saying you haven’t had challenges or a tough life. About everyone has apart from super privileged people.

The difference is: you haven’t ALSO HAD the challenge of being a woman or POC as well as your personal challenges. That is your privilege. You will never know how tough it is to be a woman or POC and live your same life.

It’s not about saying nothing in your life has been tough. Shit life is tough for damn near everyone.

I can also accept I have privilege as a white passing male, compared to people the same heritage or ethnicity as me who aren’t white passing or male. That doesn’t mean I’m ‘guilty’ as a person. It means I’ve avoided certain additional difficulties in life, but I’d rather root out and help fix or aid the people who face those additional challenges.

LabourUK,comment,interest,kkadb37,Santaire1,,">So, for one. I agree, stalin was extremely purge happy and that, imo, did negatively harm the Red Army's ability to contend with nazi germany early war. The Red Army did still have excellent officers, but they were currently in the east along the manchurian border at the start of 1941.

I feel you are underestimating the impact of this. Last I checked about 20% of all Soviet military deaths in the entire war happened in only the last 6 months of 1941, while fighting on the defensive in their own land. Obviously this is a counterfactual, but it does not seem unrealistic to suggest that a Soviet Union which had not purged a substantial portion of its senior officers and thrown out its key doctrinal texts would have performed vastly better than the USSR did in reality.

Moreover, I feel you're brushing over the point made in my third paragraph. What records we have of strategic discussions in German High Command suggest that even into 1941 the Nazis were hesitant to launch a war against the USSR at the time, for understandable reasons (even then the Soviet army was larger and more mechanised than the German army); a major part of why they eventually decided to do so was down to the perception of Soviet military weakness following the Purge. Not necessarily *actual* weakness (the impact of the Purge is frequently overstated thanks to older texts produced before we could access the Soviet archives), though that existed too, but perceived weakness.

>War against the nazis was always inevitable. Stalin and hitler had been speaking out against one another since the founding of the third reich, even more so before it with the soviet aligned communist party of germany, Ernst Thalmann, the Rotfront and early founding Antifa. Stalin, right up until the molotov ribbentrop pact, attempted to sign 3 separate anti berlin pacts with the west, with the third being rejected literal months prior to the start of ww2. Stalin fully planned on going after germany. But, he was smart enough to know that as of 1939, he wasn't ready for that war. He had that dejected realisation that we can not fight these people yet and so sent Vyacheslav Molotov to sign a NAP.

This is a very kind reading of Stalin's conduct. While, yes, war between the USSR and the Nazis was likely inevitable because Hitler was an expansionist genocidal warmonger, the extent to which Stalin believed it was inevitable any time soon is very much in question. To evidence this, Stalin was repeatedly warned by his own intelligence service that Germany would invade the Soviet Union in 1941, and yet right up until the beginning of Operation Barbarossa he refused to order a full-scale mobilisation or to restrict Soviet exports to Germany.

>Your points about the german soviet treaties are fair. As a marxist-leninist, im in complete agreement that it was a fucking stupid thing to do. However, what we are witnessing is a country not yet ready for the war it knows is coming for it, and so is doing whatever it can to push it back for as long as it can. It was also a both ways type of thing. While germany got what they wanted, the soviets also got much needed supplies that would allow them to set the early t-34 and kv-1 into mass production as early as 1939, and the soviets would not have held as long as they did without these two tanks in 194.

This I would say underestimates the importance of Soviet exports to the German war effort. From mid-1940 right up until the outbreak of war in June 1941 the Soviet Union always made up at least 50% and often over 70% of all German imports, including over 70% of all imports of key materials like chrome and manganese, about 20% of all of Germany's barley (both imported and harvested), most of Germany's imported rubber, a massive chunk of the imported fuel, and more. [Wikipedia provides a nice convenient table that demonstrates how important Soviet raw material imports were for the German war effort](https://imgur.com/a/hTgZOiS).

There's not really anything the Soviets could have received from Germany that would be anywhere close to as valuable as giving Germany enough stockpiled oil, grain and rubber to launch Barbarossa and maintain it until they could seize enough land to make up the loss in imports. Certainly, the machine tools they received were important (though the T-34 wasn't put in mass production until 1940, for the record, its first 2 prototypes weren't tested until January 1940), but not to that extent, and the Germans never actually delivered as much as they were supposed to (they deliberately procrastinated and under-delivered). Not to mention that a lot of what the Soviets did import was naval technology, designs and ships, none of which were particularly helpful to their war effort.

>Literally, every allied power had at some point, including right up until 1939, a treatybor trade agreement with the nazis. I mean, we as the UK literally signed away an entire countries national sovereignty, yet it's treated as a ""meh what can you do"", yet the soviet treaty, in effort to avoid a war they can't fight yet, is the greatest betrayal ever.

I'd say there's a difference between having trade treaties with another party while you're both at peace is distinct from the Soviets being literally the only thing allowing the Nazis to carry on their war effort without running out of food and oil. If Britain refused to trade with the Nazis in 1938 they could still import from South America or non-British-held Asia, if the Soviets refused to trade with them in 1940 they would've been shit out of luck. Though, yes, you are not wrong that the Allies did also trade with the Germans pre-WW2, and it is mildly hypocritical for them to point fingers when they probably would've been quite happy to be the ones trading with Germany if Hitler had declared war on the Soviets instead of Poland.

>In the end, however, most of the old bolsheviks were either on stalins side in the centre or had taken with the left or right. After the assassination of Sergei Kirov, he wasn't taking any chances. If you were in anyway endicted with the right ( the group who is believed to have killed Kirov ) or the left ( Stalin was highly paranoid that trotsky wanted to assassinate him after the death of Kirov so decided to get him first ) you were done.

Why do you think the Right killed Kirov? Generally I've understood there to be 3 general theories as to his death.

1. The lone gunman - Kirov was partly responsible for Nikolaev being expelled, and was rumoured to have slept with his wife, so it could have simply been a case of a deeply unwell man taking revenge on who he saw as the architect of his misfortune.
2. Stalin plot - dubious circumstances regarding Kirov's bodyguard being far away (and then dying the next day), strange treatment of the assassin prior to the killing (ie arrested but not jailed despite carrying a firearm into a government building previously), the reduction in the size of Kirov's protection detail, all to kill a potential threat to Stalin's position and give an excuse to launch the purges.
3. Zinoviev did it - this was the 'official' finding of the Soviet government under Stalin. Zinoviev wasn't of the Right within the Soviet Union AFAIK, pretty sure he was more Centre/Left, as he supported Stalin in the early 20s against Trotsky's Left Opposition and then broke with Stalin in the late 20s when Stalin began working closer with the Right Opposition.

I've typically favoured the first one personally, the rest have a lot more evidence against them, but I don't recall coming across a claim that it was specifically the Right who did it. Bukharin (as sorta the Arch-Rightist of the USSR) was accused of treason, of attempting to murder Lenin, Stalin and Ghorky, and of seeking to partition the Soviet Union between Germany, Japan, and Great Britain, but not, to my knowledge, of orchestrating Kirov's death - that was reserved for Zinoviev and Kamenev, not the Right.",2024-01-30 17:48:52+00:00

The landlord would've known their fix is coming to an end and would know, roughly, how much extra it'll increase by and how that'll affect their ROI. Now there is little they can do to ""plan"" for a fix ending beyond either increasing rent (and I'm sure you aren't a fan of that avenue) or making the decision to say they are done with that property and wish to sell up. Which if the tenancy agreement is coming to an end at the same time may make that decision a bit easier for the landlord. In any case, that is the planning you speak about. Plan to either increase rent or sell up (or do nothing and stomach the extra cost themselves i suppose).

>expecting renters to pay unreasonable amounts of money

Define reasonable. And more importantly, who gets to decide what is reasonable? Whether you or I like it or not, it's the landlord. It's their property, and they can ask whatever they like in terms of rent. Any landlord, however, knows that it is far better to have a property rented at some rate than sitting empty at a high rate.

As for the 26 weeks suggestion, I mean I certainly think it's far more reasonable than 52 but still, I am unconvinced that it is appropriate. Having said that I am not really the person to determine that alone as, while I do understand the landlord side of things well, I haven't a clue on how the process of leaving a rented property and finding a new one is.",2024-01-29 14:45:52+00:00

That's not going to happen because A) the West will not lose that face and B) Russia has no desire to return to the status quo ante. That bridge is burnt, vapourised and the ashes shot into the sun.

That's the brute reality. You cannot drastically reduce the output of one of the most important pipelines to Europe and then just replace that with LNG or other sources without it having a *major, major* knock-on effect on availability and thereby price.

Price caps are insane and essentially never work. All they can do is redirect the cost of something onto somebody else or induce shortages by synthetically selling the product at below its market value.

So our ""solution"" is basically to reduce demand and up output in the cheapest ways we can because anything less is going to kill people this winter through reduced home heating due to high energy prices. Also induced through the recession which is assuredly here unless we're just going to lie about it like the Biden admin.

The issue is that there are basically no trivial energy needs. We don't just casually waste energy for lols. People have inefficiencies and whatnot but it's not because they want to, it's because the alternative technologies are expensive in their own right or reduce your standard of living. So that's basically the answer, we will as a nation continue our living standards decline.

Things get seriously fucked when people cannot afford to commute to work and with fuel / emissions taxes as well as the underlying cost of petrol and used cars we're getting disturbingly close. The cost of a new, efficient car is so damn high let alone an old banger that gets you taxed out the wazoo.

Longer term more emphasis should be placed on nuclear but I don't see it happening much because so much money is being pumped into renewables.

unitedkingdom,post,isa,1z4j7k,ChoppingOnionsForYou,This bank scam happened to my friend a couple of days ago.,"THIS IS A WARNING. It’s not a “I had this forwarded to me from a friend and it’s best to forward it to all the people in my contacts” story. This happened to a very good friend of mine, two days ago, and while I'm not naming her, I'm naming the banks, because of how well they dealt with the situation.

It’s a Bank Scam. It’s an alarmingly good one. (It’s also something of a wall of text, for which I apologise.)

My friend was phoned on Tuesday evening, and someone claiming to be from her bank (Nat West) asked if she’d just spent £4000 on goods in Argos that day, and £7000 on something else. On hearing that she had spent no such sums on anything recently, the “bank” person said, “you need to call the number on the back of your card, and start to reset your accounts – here’s the reference number, so you’ll come back through to this department.”

So my friend duly called the number, which was answered immediately and professionally, and she was put through to the helpful lady to whom she’d been speaking. At which point the lady, patiently and kindly, started to help her “set up new accounts”. These new accounts were, in fact, just payments to the scammers. 

Questions were asked about security on other accounts, and on hearing that she had an ISA with Santander, the lady said, “Oh, we’d better protect that one, too.” My friend, not completely without, did query whether she could help set up accounts for other banks, too, only to be told that nowadays this was quite normal, and a payment was set up for that, too.

Mention of a business account at a different bank resulted in a similar procedure, although Lloyds apparently requires a wait period of an hour before payments can be made to new destinations – I suspect this is a business account thing. “That’s OK,” reassured the scammer, “I’ll call you back in an hour, and we can continue.”

The scammer then asked if there were other members of the family living near/with my friend, who mentioned her son. The scammer then, very plausibly, said that since so many children tried to cheat their parents out of funds, it would be best not to mention to him about all this until it was settled.

Thankfully my friend’s son arrived home soon after, and even more thankfully, she trusts him absolutely. She told him all about this, and when the scammer called back, and told her to call the bank number, my friend’s son told her to call on her mobile. Obviously connecting to the bank this time took somewhat longer than the previous time, and while she was getting through, the scammers called back on her landline, got my friend’s son, and asked why she hadn't called – “She should call on the landline because her number comes up on our system and her call can be directed more quickly.” On being questioned by the son, the scammer became agitated and rude, at which point the call ended, and the son turned to his mum and said, “Mum, you've been scammed – you need to tell the bank right away.”

The good news is that the Lloyds payment hadn't been made yet. My friend (via her son) managed to contact Santander in time to stop that payment, which left the bank payment – her bank, on being informed that all this had happened within the last couple of hours, have even been able to refund the initial payment.

So how did a call back to the bank result in connection to the scammers? Because too many people have forgotten that on UK landlines, it’s the CALLER who breaks the connection. If the caller doesn't hang up, all they have to do is listen for bleeps coming down the line to indicate dialling, and “answer” the call pretending to be the bank. As long as she used her landline, my friend could have called ANY number, and been “connected” to the scammers, who simply didn't hang up.

My friend kept saying, while recounting all this, that the “bank lady” had been extremely patient and helpful, and had seemed, as she carefully coached my friend through setting up the payments, to be able to see what was happening on my friends account as she did it. These people will very likely have access to the banking site, and will know thoroughly how the payments are made, and how the system reacts to certain conditions.

And of course the woman was patient – she was scamming my friend out of her life savings!

And yes, my friend WAS suspicious about whether her ""bank"" could set up payments for other banks - but she is an older lady, and a self-confessed Luddite. She kept saying how patient the woman was, and how if ever she sounded unsure about something, the woman would ask if she wanted to make sure and call the bank back again, on a known number, so my friend would feel guilty for doubting, and carry on. As she said, she did it ALL to herself - SHE set up the payments, and told me how at every stage the scammer was kind and patient, asking if she was OK etc.",2014-02-27 22:24:49+00:00

People will only care if getting online becomes inconvenient - such as requiring registration, permanent ID etc.

A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits; an unemployed man doesn't. Here the tendency of which I spoke at the end of the last chapter comes into play. When you are unemployed, which is to say when you are underfed, harassed, bored, and miserable, you don't want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit 'tasty'.

europe,comment,loan,gzyfytf,usmilitarythrowaway1,,"Russia has agreed to release $500m in credit to Belarus and look to increase the number of flights between the two countries as the Kremlin doubled down on its support for Alexander Lukashenko after his forced landing of a passenger flight that has sparked western condemnation.

Russian president Vladimir Putin hosted Lukashenko in Sochi on Saturday, treating his guest to a yacht trip on the Black Sea a day after the two men held talks for more than five hours.

The two-day summit has underscored Moscow’s position as the embattled autocrat’s closest and most reliable foreign ally, and took place as the US joined the EU in imposing sanctions against Minsk.

Russia’s support for Lukashenko was in stark contrast to US and EU condemnation and could complicate preparations for a summit between Putin and US president Joe Biden in Geneva next month, which has been billed as an effort to normalise relations between Moscow and the west.

Belarusian authorities used a bomb threat and a fighter jet to force a Ryanair flight travelling between Greece and Lithuania to divert to Minsk on May 23, where police then detained Roman Protasevich, a leading dissident journalist, who was on board.

That brazen move, described by Ryanair as “state-sponsored piracy”, provoked condemnation from western countries.

The EU has banned Belarus state airline Belavia from its airports and pledged to impose additional sanctions against the country, while Biden on Friday reimposed “full blocking sanctions” against nine Belarus state-owned companies.

The Kremlin has criticised the west’s response and, announced that a delayed $500m loan to Minsk would be released by the end of June.

The money represents the second tranche of a $1bn financial package Moscow agreed in December to bolster Lukashenko’s finances, which have been hit by the fallout from mass protests against his fraudulent election victory last year, and the impact of Covid-19.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the transport ministries of Russia and Belarus would work together to “organise air transportation” that would allow Belarusians to travel to Russia for summer vacations and to fly home from European countries via Russia, offsetting the impact of the EU’s flight ban.

“President Lukashenko informed [Putin] in detail about what happened to the Ryanair plane,” Peskov told reporters, adding that the talks were “very constructive, rich in content”.

The Kremlin has dismissed as “Russophobia” western claims that Moscow assisted Minsk in the operation to arrest Protasevich or was given advance warning.

The dissident founded a media channel that reported on and helped co-ordinate protests against Lukashenko.

Russia this week forced at least two European airlines to cancel flights to Moscow after it failed to approve new flight plans involving a detour around Belarus.",2021-05-30 08:14:29+00:00

I was searching how to shred plastic and it led me to this site which was started by a guy in the Netherlands. Since then their community has grown and  now they  have designed a hot press for biodegradable  products using sintering method [Food waste Sintering](https://youtu.be/UD57zOGqAPs)

I love the environment but I'm not going to go crazy-no plastic-in-my-life ever mentality, it would drive me insane if I had to this about this day by day. So instead, I would like to build up a community in Northern Ireland to make alternatives for Single use disposable plastic polystyrene and progress  repurposing waste plastic if I can.

The first step was to start up a Facebook page Precious Plastic Belfast. Just to put out the idea and concept. Would like to set up a website as there are many that do not bother with social media platforms. Maybe someone would like to help with this.

I  think that this would be a good active organization post epidemic that can bringing people with similar interests together. You could choose to participate  actively or passively 

I  like the idea of  making biodegradables  and there are ways to use  Fruit and vegetable peelings and Used coffee beans . 

To set this up it's going to cost 2,000 at least, A bank loan is possible but  I rather put profits back into growing this idea instead of into the pockets of Banks. So I am looking at crowdfunding to raise money for this . The main problem with this is  to raise  capital, you need a large source of people beyond friends and family

ukpolitics,comment,mortgage,iu9sghn,GrepekEbi,,"When something happens which massively changes the market conditions, that all goes out of the window, ESPECIALLY with an essential commodity.

Literally everything sold has been sold for the most the company can get away with up to now, and the balancing force is competition (if my bread is too expensive, they’ll buy some other bread from someone else)

When ALL the bread increases at the same time, it massively changes the supply and demand curves and people have no choice but to raise how much they’re willing to pay.

Some things, like water and housing, have effectively infinitely high caps on what people will pay (because they need them to live) and so the ONLY thing that keeps prices low is the possibility that someone can get it cheaper elsewhere - this is why pricing collusion is illegal - if everyone in a market raises their prices, the consumer doesn’t just stop buying an essential commodity, they just get shafted

This is what’s happening - a huge number of landlords HAVE TO raise their rent. The rest of them recognise that as the average price of renting goes up (driven by those btl landlords with mortgages) they can get away with pushing theirs up a bit too. And that raises the average more, and so everyone raises it again. This is how you get sudden skyrocketing prices like we see at the moment

Now, obviously people don’t have infinite resources, so there’s an upper limit to how much people are physically able to pay. But people will eat through all of their savings AND go in to massive debt before they’ll choose homelessness.

Reading the paper, it seems this had been significantly considered, don't think it's been ignored at all

>One We would use the time between a vote for independence and day one of independence to put in place all the requirements for continued use of sterling

>On day one of independence, the Scottish Government would have legal and regulatory responsibility for the macroeconomic regime in an independent Scotland.

>The key operational requirements for day one would be to have created the new institutions and the necessary functions to ensure financial stability.

>The Scottish Government would work with UK regulators to ensure a coordinated and clear process.

>Alongside this, on independence the Scottish Government would have full control of fiscal policy, further discussed below, and we would ensure sufficiency of sterling reserves to cover this initial phase.

>Two We would establish a Scottish Central Bank, to be in operation from day one of independence

>The main new institution to be established would be a Scottish Central Bank. It would operate independently of Government and be given a clear mandate, initially focusing on ensuring financial stability.[105]

>Further institutional capacity would be required for the development of financial regulation functions and for fiscal policy. We propose a new framework that is credible and comparable in scale and scope to those of similar economies.[106]

>Scotland’s current institutional framework is significantly different from that in 2014: new institutions such as the Scottish Fiscal Commission, Revenue Scotland and the Scottish National Investment Bank are already established and operating, with the Scottish Government already performing Exchequer functions for devolved powers and spending.

>The Scottish Central Bank would also act as a lender of last resort, where necessary, to the financial system in Scotland in line with current UK practice.

>As part of its financial stability role, the Scottish Central Bank would also ensure that deposit guarantees are in place. The current UK guarantee ensures bank deposits are covered up to £85,000 per account, which, in the event of a bank becoming insolvent, is guaranteed by the Government, but then funded by the financial sector through a levy.[108]

>Scottish banks would also be able to use commercial payment services for transactions in sterling and other currencies.

>Three We would put in place the necessary level of sterling reserves for day one of independence

>Scotland would not require foreign exchange reserves for market interventions when continuing to use sterling. It would require reserves for functions related to the Scottish Central Bank’s role of maintaining financial confidence and the stability of the system.

>The Scottish banking sector has changed significantly since the financial crisis in 2008-09. There is now a smaller domestic banking sector with many of the major banks operating in Scotland as part of larger UK and international groups.[109] The level of sterling reserves that an independent Scotland would require for day-to-day central bank operations would be proportionate to the size of the sector and in line with the regulatory requirements for the sector. The financial services sector as a whole is discussed in Box 7 below.

>There have also been changes to how banks are regulated. For example, they are no longer required to hold assets in relation to a fraction of their deposits, and instead are required to maintain regulatory capital to ensure they can absorb any losses in terms of their commercial and household loans.

>The Scottish Central Bank would be required, given existing financial regulations, to govern the level of capital required by commercial banks to be held as reserves and, in doing so, would follow the international capital framework standards on capital requirements of commercial banks (known as Basel II).",2022-10-17 13:25:11+00:00

Nobody is naive, including the agro lobbies. I agree on this. This does not change my comment though.

We in Spain are eating f\_cking morocco (or even further) fruit and vegetables while throwing away local products, because they cannot compete. They just cannot, because the regulation here is crazy when compared with no regulation at the other side of the Estrecho de Gibraltar. The costs difference is on another level. The local farmers have nothing to do. They are suffocated with the abusive margins of the distributors and big supermarkets, who basically bring products from everywhere except Spain at a cheaper price than local products. Total non-sense. Somebody (not the farmers) is getting very rich in this chain.

The focus should be on the distributors and the illegal competence. I do not like intervening the economy and I do not believe in subsidies, but in this case the distributors are generating a huge problem for us. If nobody does somehing, some distributors will become absurdily rich and we will lose our farmers, becoming totally dependents from the foreign suppliers.

in the UK (England), my understanding is that, for example, on a salady of £150k, the following would happen:

20% of £37,700, which is the difference found in the 20% basic rate band (£12,571 to £50,270)

40% of £74,870, which is the difference found in the 40% higher rate band (£50,271 to £125,140)

40% of £12,570 (the personal allowance which is now being taxed)

45% for any value above £125,140

I was wondering the political/parliamentary why's behind paying 40% over the £12,570 instead of 20%. 

I understand it would reduce the overall contribution, but that particular band goes from 0% to 40% and is what increases the tax burden for those earning above £100k substantially in comparison to those advancing to the 45% band.

(27.43% to 33.97% to 35.8%)

What the Tories represent today is the same U.S. based neoliberal capitalist puppet regime that literally overthrew the British people's Socialism in the 1980's after a decade long operation of sabotage in the 1970's. It was a two pronged attack on Britain, both economic sabotage and the covert support of anti British terrorism by providing the IRA with weapons. A team of American based IRA gunrunners was literally aquitted in American criminal court in 1983 because their defence was, how could their gun running operation have been a crime in the U.S. when they were working for the CIA? Think about that.

The economic attack included the U.S. pulling the plug on the Bretten Woods system and then conspiring at the 1973 Bilderberg meeting to quadruple the price of oil by getting their new partners in the petro-dollar agreement, the Saudis, to implement an oil embargo which totally threw the British economy under the bus. That sudden unexpected high price of oil causing massive inflation that bankrupted Britain and forced us to accept IMF loans with strings attached. Those strings all designed to sabotage socialist policy and implement capitalist privatisation. During this time Milton Friedman and Co and Thatcher were waiting, lined up to implement the final insult, the asset stripping pillage of the defeated British economy which was to sell off all our national industries and assets to Wall Street, including all our building societies which handed all Britains savings and loans to the high interest banking cartels and then they disarmed Britain by pulling the plug on Britains own nuclear deterrent, the Polaris system which used British made nuclear warheads and replacing it with the American Trident D5 system. The US never wanted Britain to have a nuclear deterrent of our own so they damn sure did not provide real live nuclear weapons with those Trident Submarines. Shortly after the switch to that fake Trident system the Tory Party passed legislation to ban British nuclear weapons testing permenantly. Obviously that ensures the British military never discovers they have a fake nuclear deterrent or ever develops a new home grown alternative.

If that was not enough, not only did they try to ensure the British people would never again own their own industries and savings and loans, or nuclear deterrent, they also implemented draconian legislation to outlaw most of the Labour Party's union base and then they groomed young Tories to infiltrate the Labour Party itself and rename it 'New Labour', under their Tory Stooge, Tony Blair. Corbyn's leadership is the first time Labour has had real Labour leadership since then.

Do not let Britain be further sabotaged and assaulted by those Tory traitors ever again. Everyone knows they want to put the final nail in the Socialist coffin by selling off the NHS.

When I challenged them on this they the receptionist started talking about how I have been taken of the system because it has been so long so will have to pay £50 to put me back on which did not make sense which I challenged further and she handed over to another receptionist which again said I have been taken of the system and to put me back on would cost and if I was to join again fresh there is a waiting list until next year.

europe,comment,pension,jn9uzf7,LeMonde_en,,"**The French President, who visited Normandy to attend D-Day commemoration ceremonies, had little to say about the fact demonstrations against the pension reform were losing steam.**  
On the first day of national protests against pension reform, on January 19, President Emmanuel Macron flew to Barcelona, leaving more than a thousand kilometers between himself and the demonstrators in Paris. The massive mobilization, which took hold even in medium-sized towns, greatly worried the Elysée Palace, haunted by memories of the Yellow Vests movement. But Macron had no intention of wavering on this flagship project of his second term, which he deemed to have been ""democratically validated"" by his re-election.  
Five months later, on June 6, the president was not abroad for the latest day protests. He traveled to Normandy to take part in the official D-Day celebrations of the June 6, 1944, landings. From there, he observed what could be the last major march against the now-enacted pension reform.  
The day after his visit to Mont-Saint-Michel, where he celebrated ""the art of being French,"" a blend of resilience and resistance, the president appeared with Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, all smiles, to attend the traditional ceremony at the naval school in Colleville-Montgomery. No pans or whistles were to be heard, unlike during other public appearances in recent weeks. Has the time for anger against a head of state accused passed? Fatigue perhaps set in.  
With his hand on the shoulder of Léon Gautier, the last survivor of the Kieffer commando unit which, 79 years earlier, landed on the beaches of Normandy to liberate France from Nazi occupation, the president placed a green beret on the head of one of the fusiliers marins, the naval infantrymen trained at the school.  
The fact that Geoffroy Roux de Bézieux, the head of the French employers' organization Medef and a former Green Beret himself, was present at the ceremony was no cause for embarrassment.

tories,comment,pension,gzemjkh,BigSARMS,,"I believe Muslim's consider it to be immoral to make promises based on an uncertain future, hence why certain derivative contracts are prohibited. I see no reason why this wouldn't also extend to overly generous pension promises, NHS promises, etc.. etc... There is something to be said for having a moral/cultural/religious framework in which to base decisions.

The systems we currently have are unsustainable whoever is in government, there isn't a magic solution here other than to adopt different systems. There is an attempt to start this with the pension auto enrollment but its quite a way off being sustainable. There is an appetite for sustainable systems, but often people target that energy on environmental issues. There is no guarantee at all that if a younger population had a significant sway over the vote that they would be in favor of better systems, I would be willing to bet the opposite to be the case - poor education is likely to blame.

Low skilled workers exist and will have it tough, this is the nature of low skilled labour. It is a tough world for low skilled workers irrespective of immigration, globalization, or anything else. The right thing to do would be to not tax them at all, and to provide education systems so that they can change their situation if they wish to.

The tax burden does rest on the wealthy in the UK which in my view is right from a moral perspective, although we likely have gone a bit too far with the wealth taxes (and all other taxes) here given that many wealthy people move away to tax havens such as Sweden.

As for automation that will massively improve the lives of all workers, but its always tricky to tell how close these developments are so we can't exactly rely on them.

I was under the impression that Labour's love for unsustainable broken systems was popular with voters who also like the sound of those systems.

A full answer would require a book :) so I'll just summarize. First of all, I'll tell upfront my biases: I was a grass-roots ""founder"" of PD, coming from the left, had great hopes and participated very actively (I also was the secretary of the first ""circolo web""). My experience is that there are still some great energies there, but also lots of big problems, by no means all coming from former DC people. Problems so big that I stopped being involved, even if I can tell you for sure that there are lots of honest and competent people ""even"" in the government, which I personally know (I'm sure there are honest and competent people almost in every other party too).

Coming to the current situation, I know that Renzi has lots of defects, but honestly I was convinced that the constitutional reform, albeit not perfect, was the last train for nurturing hope that Italy could finish all the reforms that we started 20 years on its own. With the referendum failed, I expect the next elections (80% probability) to yield a new ""big coalition"", but this time possibly with the right having the bigger stake. This would mean that we'll limping along for a few years, without new big reforms, until the next big international downturn, at which point... I'm not optimistic.

If instead M5S+far right+far left will poll so high to make it impossible to create a big coalition (I exclude that the extreme left and right can get into it, I see it impossible for M5S to get 51%) I expect a Greek scenario: election after election, spread exploding, the troika here, and who knows.

My biggest hope - even if it's a long shot - is that changes at the EU level could invert the direction we're headed. I personally would participate in any serious initiative to get there.

A few of my friends were offered this - inwhich the course was hard, making you work long hours for a similar wage as a normal worker... But then again nothing worth having is easy to get in life.

I find it funny too that I used to turn my nose up at these sort of things; yet most of those I worked with at Tesco are probably on just as much as a Graphic Designer and don't have a £21K debt. 

The worrying thing, that I guess would imagine will never happen, is if Tesco started charging for this course... Because then you are having to pay to be employed! Which we are not too far off seeing with all the youth unemployment. Companies have us all by the balls.

FYI I'm a married, 35 year old marketing manager, with a mortgage and 2 kids, but I certainly respect the opinions of those younger than myself.

Young people have much more of a finger on the pulse of how the world is changing, they're more embedded in how life is going to be, rather than obsessed with chasing after the way things used to be.

I've always, for as long as i can remember, been against the neo-liberal ideology that is crippling wage growth and maximising corporate profits, exploiting the human beings behind our economy in the chase for unsustainable endless growth. The fact that the Tories represent the absolute opposite of my personal views does not make me some naive liberal arts educated child.

Furthermore, most proponents of Nordic style government are mainly focussed on social programmes and institutional change which the MUP is neither.

Wales,comment,savings,i38y2nw,Informal-Scene-2648,,"So there's a variety of factors that, generally speaking, determine the direction a language is going in, including generational factors etc. Two areas I think are important are : 

Public perception - do people see having the language as a positive or useful thing? Is it seen as unpopular, useless, inferior, or old-fashioned in some way? 

The factor that can help with that - 
What activities you can do via that language? In Wales, a person can go to school, university, and get a job, socialise, watch soaps and sports and so on, listen to music, hire tradesmen, do paperwork, etc etc all through the medium of Welsh. So in a lot of areas, it's got an equal footing with English - and when it's not made available, enough activism for people to kick off. From reading your comments, it seems like language provision has a major drop off at secondary school - sort of accidentally sending the message that Irish is not a language of prospects. It sounds like a 16 year old wanting to live mostly in Irish would have to try a lot harder than a Welsh kid. 

I think the main thing that could help is increased access to Irish medium education (not just lessons teaching it as a language, those are near-useless) - I'm in an area with a mixture of Welsh and English speakers, and there are teenagers who learnt Welsh at school who do chat in it - a bit of a secret language for them if their parents missed out.",2022-04-03 17:47:02+00:00

Seems a little pointless to tie it to Brexit considering it makes international travel harder. Also the claim that it saves on exchange rates is questionable. The GBP <-> Token <-> EUR rate steps are going to be based on use and demand rather than currency conversion rate so no chance that it's actually useful.

> Incentivisation

The idea that ""you can only spend it within app"" doesn't make it more valuable, it makes it less valuable - like a gift card for your birthday that could have been real money.

Easily the weakest claim. You're using the Ethereum network. If you used actual money you wouldn't go around claiming you're supporting fiat capitalism.

The Labour Party has been historically close with Trade Unions, it still is. There was a cooling off under New Labour in this relationship and many of the previous laws put into place by the previous Conservative governments led to further very restrictive laws that came into force last year as part of the Trade Union Act.

As it stands we currently have two types of Union recognition within workplaces. Statutory and voluntary. Under statutory once 50%+1 of the bargaining group then you can apply for statutory recognition and this gives you full bargaining rights on everything. (There are also other ways to gain this but it is more risky) This is hard to get as people move around jobs more especially in the areas this would help the most.

Voluntary recognition is the most frequent type seen and under this it is a take it or leave it situation. For the company I work at that is what we have, but the union does not have the rights to negotiate on pay, holiday, or conditions.

Trade Unionism has moved on since the 70s and 80s. It has had to. No longer can we go out on strike at the drop of a hat. It is more about campaigning and making changes. The union I am a member of and rep my work colleagues for has over the last year had victories against Uber, McDonalds, Lidl, Deliveroo, Asos. Two of those Uber and Deliveroo was around the status of worker versus employee. This is how Unions are working now on a national level, on the local level we are still doing the bread and butter work. Representing our members, carrying out health and safety checks, something that saves lives and saves money for a company if they fix any issues.

What would I change? I would make it mandatory for unions and executive boards to have ways of working together. If you have that involvement then you know why changes are being proposed and the reasoning behind them. That may then create a better relationship between the workers and executives.",2018-02-07 15:27:26+00:00

ukpolitics,comment,tax,kvpqktm,escoces,,"First sensible reply i have received. 


Like i said - a policy tweaked to maximise benefit to the exchequer could be justified. 


So we are talking about couples (not single parents) who have one partner on over £100k and another who makes a low enough salary that the cost of childcare makes them question the value of work, but makes a high enough salary that they are net contributor to the exchequer for themselves, plus the cost of the childcare.  What percentage of all people earning over £100k does this represent? I would say the spouse salary range is very fine indeed - if it even exists. 


So we have as a benefit to the state: tax revenue from spouse in that salary range (which i question that it exists), for a few years while the childcare.


Cost to the state: childcare for the period, plus childcare for every single parent earning over £100k, childcare for couples where both parents are on high salary, childcare for parents over £100k where the spouse decides not to work regardless but claims childcare.


There's a lot to consider and i struggle to see where the net benefit would come from but if it could be tweaked and maximised to only pay to the people who provide a net benefit overall then i could support it.

The only reasons you could give are more to do with not handing Labour a 500 seat parliament. 

  
But frankly I think a tory collapse and reform is needed. Possibly with Reform but just generally. They are riven into 5 groups. At least one of those groups should probably be a different party by now. The centrist blob that controls the party is barely right wing and certainly not conservative any more and hasn't been for a while. And theyre just out of ideas. Have no conviction. Their record in government is almost painfully empty. 

Ok they did austerity but everyone stood on that in 2010 (go check the manifestos). They did covid but virtually any party would have done the exact same things at a meta level. They did brexit but only to the extent they were forced to, they didnt *want* to do brexit so its debatable how different that would have been with any other party who also didnt want to.

I guess they reformed schools? They pass gay marriage but again that was coming with any government at that point.

I stand by my statements. Legislating increasing in minimum and living wage is one of the reason why the poor are so poor. 100%.

By killing off SMEs you have giving big corporations more control over the markets. Allowing them to jack up the prices.

Which FYI increasing minimum and living wage doesn't work anyway, because companies will only jack up the prices to cover their new found expenses anyway. It is just lazy thinking and the instant gratification mindset that makes it so appealing.

In regards to the kleptocracy society. I couldn't agree more, but it is incumbent on you the British people to do something about it. So what are you going to do.

#8 Remain Campaign Predictions that have failed to pass...

● George Osborne’s remainer Treasury infamously predicted a loss of 500,000 jobs after the Brexit vote. In reality, unemployment is at the lowest rate since 1975.

● JP Morgan just after the Brexit vote claimed Scotland would leave the United Kingdom and get a new currency. Support for Scottish Independence is 12 points behind support for the Union.

● The former Chancellor also claimed there would be an emergency budget with higher taxes and borrowing, he was later sacked by Theresa May and no such budget was introduced.

● Former Health Minister Stephen Dorrell claimed Brexit would “undermine” funding for the NHS. Theresa May recently announced a £20bn boost to the NHS’s budget, partly paid for by reduced contributions to the European Union after Brexit.

● According to European Council President Donald Tusk Brexit could “be the beginning of the destruction of not only the EU but also Western political civilization in its entirety,”. Civilisation remains intact (as of yet).

● The IMF claimed Brexit would lead to a recession but since the vote, Britain’s GDP has grown in every quarter.

● A new world war was predicted by David Cameron, who claimed “Can we be so sure that peace and stability on our Continent are assured beyond any shadow of doubt? Is that a risk worth taking? I would never be so rash as to make that assumption.” No wars have yet taken place in Europe.

[EU referendum: Cameron says UK exit could put peace at risk. BBC 9th May 2016](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36243296)

*really?*

>Cynical (and smelly) no-voters to this day probably question her social justice credential

fuck you, cunt breath.

>If Sturgeon and the SNP were driven only by the constitutional question, why is she advocating an end to austerity?

She isn't.  She's using slightly radical rhetoric that allows the SNP and their constructed idea of ""Scotland's voice"" to be so very different to the rest of the country.  However, the manifesto offered doesn't support that claim.

>We all remember how they spun the economic facts to suit their case.

do we? by far the greatest economic spin I remember came from the yes camp, where a large degree of optimism was required to make the figures work.  One quote a heard recently that summed it up was that *""arithmetic was treated like some kind of fusty English imposition""*

>So I put it to you that the economic plan of the SNP - to prolong deficit reduction to soften the impact of austerity - is proof that the SNP are foremost a party of social responsibility; they prioritise their social justice agenda above their constitutional agenda

It's far from being anything like ""proof"".  You'll have to do much more to convince me.  The SNP are following a strategy that has allowed them to become popular, more powerful and closer to independence than ever before.  That's what they really care about and is what holds them together, not any principles about social justice. They are taking a slightly more gradualist approach to independence because that will allow them to maintain that popularity and power and to continue with their strategy to remove Scotland from the UK.  Supporting Tory policy for a couple of quick wins will see that popularity fall dramatically and damage the potential for independence in the near future, regardless of the surrounding economic environment.  Without a popular party to lead the campaign it stands no chance. 

I think I would lay my life on the line to say that the SNP would be talking a very different and more conventional economic argument in their rhetoric if we were in an independent Scotland and they were not needing to create division with rUK (for a start it would probably match more closely with their manifesto facts and figures).

>it's time you 'internationalist socialist' blairites (or should I say Blairwrongs?) got a grip and got with the program

ukpolitics,comment,taxation,ej8qlzp,green_meklar,,">The land-tax system means I pay $1200/month for the privilege of living within commuting distance

And yet the land you own still has nonzero sale value, demonstrating that you enjoy a net privilege by owning that land in its convenient location.

In the meantime, you *also* pay a considerable amount of sales tax and (if you have a remotely decent job) income tax. Unlike the tax on land, those taxes actually discourage productive economic activity

>Renting a house roughly (give or take $500 or so per month) breaks even with the cost of land-tax+mortgage

But the mortgage eventually stops, and in the meantime it feeds into making your land an asset. Renters don't get these advantages. They just pay their entire lives and don't accumulate any assets as a result.

>no-one arguing for land-tax takes into account human greed.

There were times and places when you could have said the same thing about abolishing slavery. Slaves were assets, and emancipation would have gutted the net worth of people who owned lots of slaves. And yet we look back on the people who freed the slaves as heroes. They did what was *morally right* (and, ultimately, economically efficient as well), even though it was hard and they faced the enormous weight of human greed working against them. I suspect there will be a time when the people who abolish land monopolization privileges will be looked back on the same way.

>you're pretty much chained there due to your job, which isn't available in cheaper areas elsewhere.

The jobs problem is partly a consequence of the existing tax system. Shifting discouraging taxes such as sales, income and capital gains taxes onto land would make it easier for productive businesses to operate and thus easier for people to get jobs. Simultaneously it would let your disposable income stretch farther because prices of consumer goods would decrease, so a job that paid less on paper would afford you an equivalent lifestyle.

>the pain threshold before you capitulate and fuck off out to start over somewhere else is pretty high, and that barrier is something a taxman will use to turn the screw

If it's expensive for you to move out, then it's also expensive for somebody else to move in.

Also, I'm aware growing the economy and tax base is the preferred approach (its something I have myself mentioned several times) but that is not something that can happen quickly (i.e. by April).

This question is just between these two options - there is no wrong answer, I am just curious to see people's opinion on this matter. 

If you would like, you can specify what cuts or tax rises you would take (e.g. scrap council tax freeze) -- ScotGov is reportedly looking at a shortfall of £1-£1.5Bn. Your answer or suggestions do not need to be popular. In this scenario you have infinite political capital - make whatever decision you feel is necessary.

(Important to mention that public spending cuts will likely be required anyway - and no realistic tax rise will generate the revenue required to fully cover the shortfall-- so tax rises will soften the blow rather than avoid cuts entirely)

This was by design: increasing their deployment at all costs was a goal of the mechanism. But we're seeing now that building them out unthinkingly is not a workable strategy. Continuing the subsidy in these circumstances would be nonsensical.

At least in Germany the huge current issue is that exactly what you describe was not done. There were subsidies for renewables after the nuclear exit was decided, but these were increasingly reduced by subsequent governments and at the same time the cost for building them was significantly increased due to red tape. That's why expansion has massively gone down post 2015. Looking at other countries there are similar pictures - initially there were guarantees to take power at a certain price or subsidize it relative to production, but these were often axed a few years later.

Now that renewables showcase a significant competitive edge compared to fossil (being far less dependent on others - except for the materials for their construction), they are being taxed into the ground. That just disincentivizes further development...",2022-11-25 14:40:12+00:00

If you leave wealth to your kids (the first 325k is tax free) than you can't just give them millions without paying some of that back into the public purse. If they went to a state school, ever received free dental treatment, ever were sick enough to need a doctor or you ever received child benefits (everyone does) then you benefited from taxes. Again not to mention the numerous other ways we all befit from public services, state intervention etc. 

And even then it's only 40% above 325k. If you leave a million to your kid that gives your kid quite a bit of privilege. If you leave them 1m then they'd receive 715k. That doesn't seem like too insane a tax. Sure if it was going to 80 or 90% tax rates I'd agree that's excessive but it's really not that extreme as things stand.

Continuing the subsidy in these circumstances would be nonsensical.

At least in Germany the huge current issue is that exactly what you describe was not done. There were subsidies for renewables after the nuclear exit was decided, but these were increasingly reduced by subsequent governments and at the same time the cost for building them was significantly increased due to red tape. That's why expansion has massively gone down post 2015. Looking at other countries there are similar pictures - initially there were guarantees to take power at a certain price or subsidize it relative to production, but these were often axed a few years later.

The real question is whether it is a good thing for the UK and the economy (which desperately needs to grow) to have an artificial limit at which point there is no benefit for people to work any harder, innovate or create more, or to try to get promoted or even just perform well at work? 

In fact, not a limit but an *active penalty* for getting a payrise. As the article says, someone who makes 95k is financially better off than someone on 120k. Nobody in their right mind would build the system like this if they were designing it from scratch - this is an aberration of a system intended to produce fairness.

ukpolitics,comment,taxes,l0wxqqy,CentLib,,"No you can't... you pay VAT and duty on all those things. I assume you'd also live somewhere, so you'd pay council tax. If you worked then you'd have to pay income tax and NI. Also if you sell your goods (like your house) you'd pay tax on that. 

If you leave wealth to your kids (the first 325k is tax free) than you can't just give them millions without paying some of that back into the public purse. If they went to a state school, ever received free dental treatment, ever were sick enough to need a doctor or you ever received child benefits (everyone does) then you benefited from taxes. Again not to mention the numerous other ways we all befit from public services, state intervention etc. 

And even then it's only 40% above 325k. If you leave a million to your kid that gives your kid quite a bit of privilege. If you leave them 1m then they'd receive 715k. That doesn't seem like too insane a tax. Sure if it was going to 80 or 90% tax rates I'd agree that's excessive but it's really not that extreme as things stand. 

It certainly seems more fair to me that someone who works hard gets to keep more of their income compared to someone who just inherited a massive estate. The state probably shouldn't be able to take more than half your assets but the level it's set at seems fair enough to me. Especially if like everyone you have benefitted from tax funded activities. Maybe if you lived in the woods, never went to state school, never saw a doctor, never used public roads, never used the internet, never used any drug or medicine developed through public funding, never used the a toilet with a functioning sewage and pluming system etc then we could implement an exemption were you didn't have to pay tax.",2024-04-23 17:01:24+00:00

europe,comment,taxing,ixqg7ic,MilkaC0w,,"> So far, for decades now, solar and wind have been subsidised to the tune of hundreds of billions through a price-forming mechanism that pays for their energy far in excess of their costs. This was by design: increasing their deployment at all costs was a goal of the mechanism. But we're seeing now that building them out unthinkingly is not a workable strategy. Continuing the subsidy in these circumstances would be nonsensical.

At least in Germany the huge current issue is that exactly what you describe was not done. There were subsidies for renewables after the nuclear exit was decided, but these were increasingly reduced by subsequent governments and at the same time the cost for building them was significantly increased due to red tape. That's why expansion has massively gone down post 2015. Looking at other countries there are similar pictures - initially there were guarantees to take power at a certain price or subsidize it relative to production, but these were often axed a few years later.

Now that renewables showcase a significant competitive edge compared to fossil (being far less dependent on others - except for the materials for their construction), they are being taxed into the ground. That just disincentivizes further development...",2022-11-25 14:40:12+00:00

If you leave wealth to your kids (the first 325k is tax free) than you can't just give them millions without paying some of that back into the public purse. If they went to a state school, ever received free dental treatment, ever were sick enough to need a doctor or you ever received child benefits (everyone does) then you benefited from taxes. Again not to mention the numerous other ways we all befit from public services, state intervention etc. 

And even then it's only 40% above 325k. If you leave a million to your kid that gives your kid quite a bit of privilege. If you leave them 1m then they'd receive 715k. That doesn't seem like too insane a tax. Sure if it was going to 80 or 90% tax rates I'd agree that's excessive but it's really not that extreme as things stand. 

It certainly seems more fair to me that someone who works hard gets to keep more of their income compared to someone who just inherited a massive estate.

A couple of years ago Svartidauði and Almyrkvi had some European dates cancelled because of poor pre-sales and the tour promoter said something about the band's being thoroughly unprepared for the undertaking. So I doubt we'll ever see them play here even if they get their shit together. Too small. Last gig I saw before lockdown was Konvent, for free, headlining an all dayer at a pub in Camden. I doubt we'll get much of that kinda show with smallEuropean bands. And it's too expensive from the states for anyone smaller than Cattle Decapitation. 

Maybe we'll get lucky and some less scene-y UK bands will start up. I've always been somewhat underwhelmed by the UK metal scene. Ingested is the most interesting thing I've heard in a while, and even then it's a bit too cringe on the lyrics for me not to laugh a bit. And the annoying focus on breakdowns. We tend to do hardcore better. Rolo Tomassi should be a source of national pride.",2020-12-31 01:16:19+00:00

But to be realistic to the system we have, if labour presented an idea that the tories implement, then why even have a Labour Party? Or any other party. If tories implement a policy that works, they will claim it as their own idea. Why would voters vote anyone else than tories everytime?

To save Ukraine now, the war needs to end sinner than later. They are losing land every day, leadership is losing support within the Ukrainian population. The demographics are being totally destroyed.

Somebody saying that men should be more committed to providing emotional intimacy or support to their partners if they want to keep a happy relationship would never be framed in the same way as you are framing physical intimacy, but it's a decent argument that they are similar in that they are priorities that seem to be gendered.
