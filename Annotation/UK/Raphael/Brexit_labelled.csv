If Sunak and the Tories had a Brexit sized wedge issue they could exploit then I firmly believe they would be able to kick the can down the road, not vet any paper candidates and just deal with it later - its what Johnson would have done (and pretty much did, afterall).

But this time there is no wedge issue big enough. The war on woke broadly only captures votes from existing headbangers. The Rwanda flights and small boats, especially the latter, had potential to shore up the blue wall but it feels like the sort of issue that means a lot more in very local areas (e.g., the south coast). No energy crisis to speak of, no COVID to speak of (in the sense of an exploitable crisis). Defense would have been ripe for exploitation if Sunak had chosen it instead of the war on woke, but it now just appears as an afterthought, not to mention that there isn't much daylight between their and Labour's policies on defense spending anyway.

My point: Paper candidates with no vetting and little campaigning can (and have) done exceptionally well recently when a huge wedge issue is driving the electorate. But Sunak's campaign is (currently) 'Labour have no plan', which I don't think is in any way enough to drive any more than the 'always vote blue' mob to flock to these candidates.

If you look at Western Romania you'll see it was a huge multicaultural place with Romanians, Germans, Serbs, Hungarians, and Jews all cohabitating in pretty equal proportions. It is true that nowadays we get immigrants from countries from which most people 100 years ago couldn't even locate to which continent they belonged to, and who are culturally very different from us. However, I'm not making an argument about immigration here. I am not even pro-immigration or  pro-refugees, or whatever. I categorically think we shouldn't be letting everyone in en-masse no matter how incompatible they are with the local culture. What I am is pro-Democracy, and that means admitting that citizens of a country have certain inalienable rights. 

My notion of citizenship isn't vague at all. There are very clear rules to becoming a citizen of a country. Not everyone can can just become one. Most people apply for a visa to get the right to live there temporarily based on some point system. There's criteria you have to meet to become a citizen; tests, time lived.in the country, interviews, ect. They hold a a whole ceremony around it if you manage to acheive the requirements. Finally, you even get a document that explicitly states your a citizen of X country. There is literally nothing vague about that. Then you join the democratic society of the country which means you have the right to vote and essentially engage in the rulership of that country, usually indirectly through representatives, or sometimes more directly through referendums/swiss democracy/ect. That's just how it works in a democracy. Everyone has an equal share of control of the state (ultimately). Nobody can just come in and arbitrarily decide that everyone with a Hemoglobin concentration over 15 has to give up their rights tomorrow and go work in the mines against their will. This isn't the 1500s. 

It's certainly less vague than pre-WW1 and the rise of nationalism where citizenship wasn't even a real concept. Before that people just moved somewhere and lived their lives more or less integrating into the local culture, or if groups of people moved together, they'd often form enclaves of their own culture which either caused problems or their culture would eventually go on to melt together with dominant local one. There weren't any passports, and there wasn't any democracy. You were mostly ruled by some King, whose right to rule was allegedly given to him directly by God himself, who also had the right to expel you whenever the hell he wanted. That's the kind of crazy shit that existed outside of the modern nations state. 

Now, if you're trying to point out that the ease of obtaining citizenship is too lax, well maybe you'd be right, I don't necessarily disagree, but if you think citizens in a country should be grouped and segrated, I think that's wrong and incompatible with the very core of how our modern countries work.",2019-11-15T15:38:46+00:00,t1_f7kqmax,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

They don’t (in my opinion) “fail” to fly to the corresponding building over the other side of the Thames. In order for the projected attempt to fail, there must have been at least a minute scintilla of potential success.

It doesn’t matter if the person standing on the edge of the roof (ready to flap their tiny wings using a pulley system of lengths of thread), tells you that they “know” it’s going to be all right (in fact, it’s “going to be fantastic”). It’s of no importance that he is surrounded by dodgy-looking characters, all egging him on. And there’s no difference caused by the insults and accusations thrown at the other people up on that roof who are desperately trying to stop this catastrophe. There is not, never was, nor ever could be the slightest *atom* of a chance that it’s going to go any other way.

Yes, Islamic democracies exist, but I wouldn’t want to live in one, nor is it a life I’d wish for my children. More to the point, whilst some immigration has had a brilliant impact on the country and continent, other immigration hasn’t, it’s brought lots of social problems that we could have done without, which I grew up with in London, and which I’ve seen develop first hand in a shockingly short space of time in Sweden and Germany. Islam is only a small part of the problem. It’s got much more to do with ethnicity and culture, and the interplay of immigrant societies with host societies. With different immigrant groups having vastly different impacts which are all too often lumped together.

I’m so exhausted of having seen the same sequence of arguments play out: it isn’t happening, you’re mad, followed by it might be happening, but you haven’t understood the impact, to it is happening, but it’s a good thing, followed by it is happening, it’s shit, but you/we deserve it. The Left has been wrong on these issue repeatedly over the last 80 years, more or less.

I care very precisely and very specifically about the lives of my children. A future in which they or their children are a persecuted minority because of their culture, ethnicity or race should be unthinkable, but it isn’t. And I’m sorry, but the weak suggestion that I don’t need to worry because it’s as likely as Star Trek, that democracies exist, and that Obama didn’t back gay marriage doesn’t cut it*, coming from the same people who told us immigration would not meaningfully change the face of the country or continent. It has, and a lot of it has been shit.
