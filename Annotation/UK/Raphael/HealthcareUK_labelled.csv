>by pushing up earnings it can also encourage more people into specialities

How? Why would someone getting paid to do more hours lead them to go into a certain field?


> it could possibly also help to expand the worker pool too.

It will not. Currently the NHS workforce sees far more people leaving it than entering, this is made worse by the significant amounts of immigrants that are leaving the UK and the NHS. Streeting's training plan does not cover anywhere near the amount of people retiring from the NHS, but also doesn't come close to the amount of people that are leaving Health entirely to work in other fields (combined with Starmer wanting to reduce immigration, this will be disastrous). This policy doesn't address the issue of the size of the workforce at all, it will not lead to further utilisation of its current workforce either. We need more medics - there are not more medics to be gained from private healthcare - and there is no policy for this.


All that will happen is that resources, primarily labour, will be delegated away from public hospitals and toward private ones where these lucrative contracts will be available.

It also amounts to saying ""Palestinians should just surrender and give up any attempt to have a sovereign homeland or recover their land.""

But yes - in theory if the Palestinians stopped fighting and just accepted Israeli rule (and the occasional displacement-by-force) the Israeli military wouldn't have to kill as many of them. Because *that's how military occupations work.* When you conquer a region *by force*, and occupy it *by force*, you have to maintain a certain level of force to keep that control.

We have seen this time and time again throughout history (Afghanistan in particular comes to mind as it has been through this a few times lately).

Lead generation (the easiest bit) can be done by universities. From there you need to do non-clinical and safety testing, which unis might manage (though there's not much teachable there, it's mostly running standard tests).

Clinical trials follow, then regulatory submissions (which are an art unto themselves, not something you're going to want to ask your organic chemists to wrap their heads around if you want to still employ organic chemists next month)

Then there's the question of scale-up, developing a process that makes kilos or tonnes of API in reproducible, safe, and cost effective manner rather than a few grams at a time in your fumehood at the lab. That means getting Chemical Engineers in to explain that your 'slightly exothermic' bench reaction will blow the fucking roof off if you try to run it at plant scale, PAT guys to develop analytical systems that let you know that the reaction is going to plan and you're not going to poison everyone because the last sack of reagent got carried in while it was raining and now the ratios of reagents are a bit off because it absorbed moisture.

Then there's formulations, because eating raw API is usually a bad idea, plus all the analytical method development you need to prove to the EMA and FDA that you're getting the right compound out and not getting any of the wrong ones.

unitedkingdom,comment,Hospital,j9u69pj,KTheFeen,,"> Abortion is evil

Well... it isn't fantastic.

Never understood how people can be so for it. Of course it's used to save women's lives, rape victims, etc. But most of the abortions that happen are a belated form of contraception.

To deny that, whatever you choose to call the being that grows inside a woman's womb, is a living being, is peculiar. 

It's why when a woman miscarriages and is understandably upset, nobody with a brain or a heart says ""don't worry, it wasn't alive or even a person. It was essentially just biological matter.""

Also, it's worth thinking about the fact that, if a pregnant woman is murdered, the murderer would be charged with murder (of the woman) and also child destruction (of the unborn baby).

Before I get the typical ""RHEEEE"" responses from le redditor, I actually am in favour of abortions; people still don't take enough responsibility before becoming or making someone pregnant, and I'm not fond of the idea of incompetent, incapable, financially insecure people having children, voluntarily bringing them into a world of unnecessary hardship.

But that's not to say I don't believe that it is a life inside the womb, regardless of where you want to draw that wonky line that separates foetus from person.",2023-02-24T16:15:10+00:00,t1_j9tm0wo,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also being abused by people who do not pay anything into the system, especially foreigners who know there is no cost to have treatment when on holiday, etc. If british people travel, we have insurance for that very purpose.

I would agree that corporate greed is edging its way into the NHS, but it's being done by this IMO. people who never needed to wait now do.. taxpayers and the people who have a legal right to be here should have priority against people who do not. If this was the case, it wouldn't be open to abuse or corruption.

In scotland, there are no charges for prescriptions, and people certainly abuse this. Again, if you have money and can afford to pay morally, you should!

[Source is here](https://legemiddelverket.no/nyheter/norwegian-medicines-agency-notified-of-blood-clots-and-bleeding-in-younger-people-after-vaccination-with-astrazeneca-vaccine)

If people want to know what might be happening, the [Spike protein of COVID-19 has been shown experimentally to cause Thrombosis in very rare cases](https://jhoonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13045-020-00954-7)

The spike protein is present in the vaccine but it's also present in COVID-19, so if it is the spike protein that's causing these blood clots, then the people who got them would get blood clots whether they got the vaccine or caught the virus, right? 

The facts, then, are:

- The chance of a blood clot from the vaccine is about 0.0003%

- Your chance of dying of SARS COV-2 is around 3% (higher if you're older and lower if you're younger).

- Taking the vaccine is about 1000x safer than catching COVID. It's actually more like 5000x safer since DIC is only fatal in around 20% of cases. 

- It's likely that if the vaccine is causing blood clots, it's because of the spike protein. Which means that if you're one of the very unlucky people who gets blood clots as a result of the vaccine, you'll probably get blood clots as a result of the virus too. 

To put into context of just how rare this is, if the 0.0003% is causation and not correlation, then after vaccinating the whole UK you'd expect 20 people to get DIC and 4 of them to die. Which is a hell of a lot lower than what you'd expect if you let COVID run rampant. And those 4 people would probably die of COVID anyway because they are susceptible to the spike protein.",2021-03-16T17:15:40+00:00,t1_gr1x0xy,,,,,,,,,,,,

ukpolitics,comment,privatisation,i80vb6t,trufflesmeow,,"Rail chiefs are on the cusp of privatising thousands of miles of trackside phone lines in a move that will pave the way for commuters to get faster on-board internet coverage.

Some 10,000 miles of phone cables running next to railway lines are to be sold off under proposals also intended to boost broadband speeds for millions of households.

The winning investor will commit to upgrading the existing infrastructure and building 250 new mobile phone masts next to the tracks to help eradicate so-called 5G “notspots”.

Officials launched an auction to sell off the phone lines a year ago, slapping a £1bn price tag on the sell-off. Two investment groups have now been selected to go into the final round.

The first includes Neos, co-owned by SSE, the FTSE 100 energy giant, which is bidding in conjunction with Spanish firm Cellnex, one of Europe’s biggest telecoms companies, according to City sources. 

They will compete against a group that includes mobile phone company Nokia, broadband provider Virgin Media, and American engineering consultancy Jacobs.

The sell-off marks a key moment for operator Great British Railways, a new public body which was mocked as ""the return of British Rail"" when it was launched by Grant Shapps in May last year.

Critics argued that the state-owned organisation, which has brought track and trains under the control of one entity for the first time in nearly two decades, was little more than ""nationalisation by stealth"".

But sources close to the phone line sell-off argue that it shows Great British Railways is eager to harness private sector investment to revitalise the railways.

The upgrade of old British Rail phone lines - some almost a century old - will act as a key plank of Government plans to drastically improve rural broadband connectivity. 

Whitehall sources say improving internet reception on board trains is a key plank of Treasury thinking to boost economic productivity as it will allow commuters to begin their working day as soon as they step foot on a train.

It will also provide a boon to the levelling up agenda, allowing people to live further away from their offices, safe in the knowledge that they can finish work on the journey home.

Many of the trackside phone lines are decades old and made of copper. Upgrading them to full-fibre lines is also expected to improve the network by leading to fewer signal failures.

Once the upgrades are completed, officials expect more than 50pc of the capacity will be left spare for investors to run their own telecoms services.

The sell-off of rail assets follows the controversial decision by Network Rail to offload its railway arches to US private equity giant Blackstone in 2018 for £1.5bn.

The sale sparked controversy among hundreds of retail tenants that let the arches from Network Rail, with fears that they would face sharp increases in rent from their new private sector landlords.

Boris Johnson has pledged that 85pc of the country will have full-fibre broadband coverage by 2025.

Great British Railways is in its formative stages, with its set up being overseen by Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines. Network Rail launched the phone lines auction a year ago and remains involved in the sales process.",2022-05-10T07:16:12+00:00,t3_umcwae,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basically what they've done is boil surgery down to the simple repetitive side of the procedure and proved the old joke that you could teach anyone to perform the basic physical task of a simple operation. The whole point of medical and surgical training is that there's far far far more to it than that.

That's of course not to mention that there are literal surgeons at that hospital training to become consultants at the moment, and I'm sure they'd have loved the opportunity for some actual 1-1 consultant teaching and operating time. The SCP has taken that away for no good reason, in fact word-of-mouth is that apparently they're in a sexual relationship with a senior consultant in the department. Ergo we're looking at a complete undermining of medical training basically for some sexual nepotism. 

The point of these roles is to save lazy consultant from having to actually do their job and train the next generation of doctors.

Scotland,comment,Healthcare,ehzk1x9,-Dali-Llama-,,">Not unrealistic necessarily but perhaps idealistic.

Sure, that's probably fair. When people are moved to support change, it's obviously accompanied by hope for better. In my case, it comes from having a lot of friends in Europe and seeing many things I want replicated here but just can't ever imagine our UK governments aiming for or our media supporting. People seem the priority in many countries, but I don't get that feeling here.  We have a bad work/life balance, expensive childcare, work insecurity, unaffordable housing and people seem generally unhappier and more stressed to me. We have a very class based, unequal society that favours the better off. I'm one of the beneficiaries nowadays but I've experienced both ends of the ladder, so I know how cruel and unfair it is at the bottom.. I agree I'm probably looking at best case scenario when I think of an indy Scotland, but I think I have a good idea of what's possible as, not only do I spend roughly two months a year with in Europe, I also hear the day to day stuff when catching up with my friends via phone/Skype etc. I think if more people knew the many advantages many citizens of even middling European countries have over us, they'd be more inclined to expect and demand more. Unfortunately living on an island with [a terrible media](https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/survey-finds-that-uk-written-press-is-by-some-way-the-least-trusted-in-europe/) that demonises ordinary people, pours scorn on anything that even faintly smells of socialism (look at the baby box stuff for instance) and fails to hold corruption and tax avoidance to account, means I think we're stuck with our lot.

> The fairer society being almost inevitable is certainly optimistic, and speaks mostly to your personal dislike of the tories 

It's more based on voting patterns up here. The UK Tories can impose austerity while giving tax cuts to the rich; introduce terrible policies like universal credit that are very damaging to the poor and just managing, and be warned of systematic violations of the rights of disabled people by the UN; pull us out of Europe and send out vans saying 'go home' while deporting people who've been here for many years (it's happening everyday beyond just the Windrush scandal). I could go on and on, but these are policies that, for some reason, prove popular with middle England and are not so widely supported up here. I don't think our Tories seem as callous, and I certainly don't think they'd make many inroads in an indy Scotland if they pursued the sorts of policies the UK Tories have since the 70's. I'm fine economically conservative parties, but I don't think the UK Tories are that. They want to leave the SM&CU so they can end FOM. That speaks more to ideology than economics to me.

> I genuinely can't see why the EU would accept Scotland's entry until Scotland gets a much tighter hold on its finances (plug that deficit). 

Aside from the fact that GERS tells us nothing about the finances of an independent Scotland, I think your concern ignores the fact that many countries run a deficit over 3%. For instance, when Croatia become the 28th member state in 2013, its deficit was over 3% (6.2% in 2010, 7.8% in 2011, 5.3% in both 2012 and 2013) and has remained over 3% since (although they have since been striving to meet the 3% limit). 

> The fervent belief that the EU would accept us never made a lot of sense to me. 

We're already in the EU and the EU is expansionist, so it makes sense they'd want to keep us/or have us back. It's also what the mood music suggests:

Recently, the school needed eight partition walls put up, to help provide better learning areas for the growing number of children with special needs who struggle with noise. “These eight partition walls cost me £36,000 as I had to use the PFI company,” she says. “They are not even brick walls. It is simply ridiculous.”

In recent months, she also needed to fit a glass panel into a door for safeguarding reasons. But she said the PFI contract meant she paid £1,430.83 plus a fee of £107.31, so £1,538.14 in total. “In another school, I could get quotes and get the work done so much cheaper,” says Foden. “I believe that if I could choose my own contractors, and wasn’t tied to this PFI contract, I could save the school around £180,000 a year.”

While some schools agree that the maintenance carried out is of high spec, other schools have also had problems of poor service from the PFI contractors. 

According to Matthew Topham, of campaign group We Own It, which pushes for public ownership of services and companies, schools are left at the whim of the PFI company, be them good or bad. 

He says: “PFIs mean schools are tied into having maintenance done by a set company, which is not value for money. This is about private finance, not about good quality service or public scrutiny. Heads are tied into deals where they can’t even see the original terms and contracts. In some schools, teachers are reduced to tears because of the state of their classrooms, which they can do nothing about. It impacts teacher wellbeing, and as a consequence, the wellbeing of the children.”

At Newman RC College in Oldham, a large secondary school that was opened in 2012, costs are also spiralling. Headteacher Glyn Potts told the BBC the school has been beset by problems with the roof that the private contractor has not fixed. Bursting radiator pipes have also repeatedly flooded classrooms.

“I have to go to those parents and say I’m doing the very best by them with no impact,” he said. “You feel like a failure.”

Other headteachers in England have said they have been advised against speaking publicly about the pressures PFI costs are causing, because of non-disclosure agreements that are built into the contracts.

In early February, Stoke-on-Trent City Council held a meeting in private with the 88 PFI schools in the city. The schools had all been warned they faced double-digit percentage increases in their PFI costs. 

A spokesman for Liverpool City Council said that the pressure of inflation on PFI facilities was a national issue. They added that any costs saved to schools through renegotiating the PFI contracts would be cancelled out by legal costs.

Meanwhile, the Department for Education blamed the former Labour government and said it was increasing support for schools in PFI contracts by 10.4 per cent in the coming financial year.

A spokesman said: “These expensive Local Authority Private Financed Initiative (PFI) contracts are a hangover from the last Labour government that are still costing taxpayers.” 

They are indeed, and until they are broken, they are costing our children their education, too.

To me this perfectly illustrates why I personally find Corbyn so difficult to get behind. This is a clear issue where he and New Labour differ. Corbyn thinks public money being paid to private companies is a bad thing.  I am ambivalent - to me what matters is that it offers value for money and maintains/increases the level of care.

PFI schemes built lots of new hospitals without having to pay all the money now. If they have since turned out to be bad value for money by all means buy out of contracts. If not, don't. It should be that simple.

Corbyn seems to be suggesting buying all hospitals out of PFI contracts regardless. This is a classic case of putting one's own ideology ahead of what's best for the public.

It's a relatively small issue, but you see a similar stance over things like fracking, GM crops, academies, nationalisation. If evidence comes out to show these things are good we should support them. If it doesn't we don't. I don't see Corbyn being that open.",2015-08-27T14:37:13+00:00,t3_3iiawe,,,,,,,,,,,,

LabourUK,post,Hospital,180nav1,cooltake,UNICEF chief marks ‘horrifying milestone’ in Gaza death toll,"Body of the article:

The head of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) marked “another horrifying milestone” Monday amid the Israel-Hamas war.

“The reported number of children killed in #Gaza has now exceeded 5,000,” UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Each one is a life extinguished and a family devastated.” 

“This must end! All children must be protected,” Russell added. 

A UNICEF spokesperson shared a similar figure Tuesday, saying in a statement, “more than 5,350 Palestinian children have reportedly already been killed. The death toll among children is sickening. Grief is being embedded into Gaza.”

Palestinian health authorities have said more than 12,700 people in Palestine have been killed since the beginning of the war last month, with two-thirds of them being women and minors, according to The Associated Press.

The Biden administration has previously cast doubt on specific numbers released by Palestinians for the death toll in Gaza, though international humanitarian groups have generally cited the figures.

U.S. and Israeli officials are currently working to secure the release of hostages taken by Hamas in the Palestinian militant group’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel. About 240 hostages, including U.S. citizens, were taken in the attack, which killed approximately 1,200 people in Israel.
White House officials have signaled hostage negotiations appear to be nearing a breakthrough.

The negotiations have played out amid weeks of fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. Palestinians have pressed for pauses in Israeli strikes as the territory faces a humanitarian crisis, with residents lacking access to electricity, water, food and other basics for weeks.

Russell, who previously served under Biden as assistant to the president and director of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel before taking the helm of UNICEF, visited Gaza recently, according to a press release. She said what she “saw and heard was devastating.”

“The parties to the conflict are committing grave violations against children; these include killing, maiming, abductions, attacks on schools and hospitals, and the denial of humanitarian access – all of which UNICEF condemns,” Russell said.",2023-11-21T18:09:18+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Translated with Deepl)
> Sheko Ahmed Raheem had already packed his travel bag. He had a visa for Belarus, tickets for the flight from northern Iraq via Dubai to Minsk. Like so many of his compatriots in recent weeks, he wanted to make his way from there across the border to Poland.
> 
> But now he is still sitting in his parents' apartment on the outskirts of Erbil, the capital of the autonomous region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq. He buries his face in his hands. He is desperate.
> 
> FlyDubai - like quite a few other airlines - cancelled its service to Minsk last week under pressure from the EU. Raheem doesn't know what to do now. He has deposited all of his family's savings for visa and airline tickets with a travel agency in Erbil, a total of $4100. If he doesn't make it to Europe or get the money back, he says, he and his parents will be broke. He is constantly researching on Facebook to see if there is still a route open to him.
> 
> Raheem, 22, is part of Iraq's middle class. He works for a pet food supplier, and his father is a security guard. And yet Raheem wants only one thing: to get out of Erbil. In Iraq, he says, there is no work, no livelihood, no future for young men like him. ""I'd rather die on the Polish border than live in Iraq,"" he says.
> 
> Like Raheem, many Kurds from northern Iraq feel the same way. Thousands of them have made their way to Belarus since dictator Alexander Lukashenko opened the country's border in the summer. The numbers have recently dropped significantly, as only a few airlines now fly to Belarus. However, the migration movement has not stopped completely. The Belarusian state airline Belavia still flies from Amman and Damascus to Minsk several times a week. The migrants wanted to continue from there to the EU, but Poland and Lithuania have closed their borders by force.
> 
> At least a thousand people are still stuck between Poland and Belarus - in sub-zero temperatures. At least ten refugees have already died. The Belarusian regime is only slowly beginning to set up night camps for the refugees.
> 
> **As harrowing as the images of freezing, starving refugees in the border region are, they have not led many citizens in northern Iraq to give up their dream of Europe.**
> 
> **In Ranya, a town about a hundred kilometers east of Erbil, young men are hunched over a cell phone in a tea garden on a November afternoon. They are watching footage from the Polish-Belarusian border. The photos and videos show refugees sleeping huddled close together in sleeping bags in the open. Of course, fleeing to Europe is risky, says one of the men, Rwanga Ali, 26. ""But what do we have to lose?""**
> 
> Kurdistan is seen by the West as a kind of anchor of stability in a country ravaged by civil wars. In fact, the people in the autonomous region are somewhat better off than in other parts of the country. Paradoxically, however, this is precisely one of the reasons why an above-average number of northern Iraqis have made their way to Belarus. **They can afford the travel costs, unlike many countrymen in Baghdad or Basra, for example.**
> 
> At the same time, there is enormous resentment about the conditions in the autonomous region. Although the north has various political parties, a parliament and elections, it has in fact been controlled for many years by two families, the Barzanis and the Talabanis. They once led the fight for independence against dictator Saddam Hussein and now claim the top positions in the state for themselves. Those who are not part of the ruling elite, northern Iraqi opposition figures criticize, have little chance of sharing in the prosperity. The war against ""Islamic State"" from 2014 and disputes with the central government in Baghdad over oil revenues have also led to the economy stagnating. Young people in particular are finding it difficult to find work.
> 
> Rwanga Ali studied pharmacy in northern Iraq. But no one wanted to hire him. Now he works in a café. He has applied for a visa for Turkey, from where he wants to continue to Europe, either by boat to Greece or, if planes to Minsk take off again, via Belarus to Poland. Ali says he wants to get married and start a family. But that's not possible in Ranya without enough money, he says. ""I don't want a better life, I want a life at all.""
> 
> One of the men sitting next to him in the teahouse, who does not want to give his name for fear of repression, agrees with him. Although there is no longer a war in Kurdistan today, the people still do not live free of fear. As president of the autonomous region, Mazud Barzani has created a repressive system. Time and again, human rights activists and journalists would disappear.
> 
> In recent weeks, social researcher Mera Jasm Bakr has spoken to several dozen northern Iraqis willing to emigrate for the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. He says it is primarily a deeply felt hopelessness that is driving his countrymen to flee. Many citizens have simply lost faith that things will change for the better. Lukashenko's opening of the border seems to them like a unique chance to escape the misery.
> 
> Nozhan Yassin Mustafa, whose travel agency in Ranya arranged visas to Belarus, says he was virtually overrun during the summer. ""Suddenly, all the people in Ranya want to go to Belarus.""
> 
> Academics like pharmacist Rwanga Ali would have good prospects for employment in Germany. But even for well-educated labor migrants from countries like Iraq, the hurdles on the way to Europe are almost insurmountable. To date, Germany has failed to create an immigration system modeled on Canada's to facilitate legal entry. Instead, people are forced onto irregular, dangerous routes via Belarus or the Mediterranean.

The answer is, and always was, that we should enforce our laws properly and control immigration to prevent abuse.

The trouble is that the leaver elites spread the lie that EU free movement means that we are not permitted to exercise any control at all over Europeans entering and remaining in our country.

Of course, such an ideal world is a long stretch away from what the world looks like now, or may realistically look like in any near future, so the anarchist position would typically be one that moves in that direction, as opposed to demanding exactly that.

Anthony Johnson, a guest on Andrew Marr's LBC show, explained the process of unpaid hours. If you missed it, it's worth listening to on Global Player.

Nurses will have a significant amount of debt and will have to work for free without getting paid. How is this possible?

£64,000 worth of debt.
2,300 hours in university
2,300 hours of unpaid work in placements, hospitals, communities, and care homes, etc.

unitedkingdom,comment,Hospital,iwp7htd,KerryKinkajou,,"You're an absolute fool if you think that all the MLAs who work in pathology are people with just GCSEs/2 A-levels. For someone studying BSc Biomedical Science to even get a chance at securing a BMS post when they finish they have to do an entire year of unpaid work during their degree. If you don't then the reality is bleak. So many band 2/3s are people with degrees and often accredited BMS degrees that have to work at these low bands for shite pay because there's no way to do your portfolio without getting some experience and getting a trainee BMS post. At my NHS Trust there are barely any band 4 posts in pathology, they make the band 3s and BMSs take on extra work to fill that gap. Plenty of the band 3s are doing the same as a BMS but just not getting paid the same or getting anything out of it. People don't realise the lack of opportunities for progression in pathology. Why should I bother staying as a band 2/3 for years when I know that without a specific accredited degree and a BMS portfolio I can't go higher than a band 4?  I've got a BSc, a Masters, and 2 years of experience in NHS/UKHSA labs yet here I am in a band 2 post because my last lab got shut down and I needed work ASAP. How are people without that kind of education supposed to get on a band 2 or band 3 post when the managers are taking desperate degree-educated people instead? Of the MLAs and band 3s I've worked with I'd say only 10-20% didn't have a degree. You might say it's unskilled work but you need people with strong education and a scientific background to be able to do the job properly and not make mistakes. I spend half my time fixing other MLAs mistakes because I developed problem solving skills in university.

Also, this has gone on for 4 years now but there seems to be no sense of urgency and no large scale funding to find biomarkers and potential treatments.  Given the scale of the problem and the number of people it affects, some of whom are literally losing everything, I just don't understand why more doctors are not helping to advocate for us.

AIDS was also a brand new illness where nothing was done for far too long.  

Many people working in the Long Covid field have said that existing treatments could probably be re-purposed to treat Long Covid.

I want to see the nationalisation of public services, end to privatisation in the NHS and to see it properly funded. I want teachers, nurses etc to be paid the wages they deserve, for a 4 day work week, for the housing crisis to be dealt with, for greed and inequality in our society to be dealt with once and for all, for a climate policy that can put us on the front foot dealing with global warming. 

I’m twenty eight and I’ve been a Labour supporter and voter (when not voting tactically) all my life and I always will be, raised in a socialist household etc. I hate the Tory ideology, the damage and division they’ve caused this country. But for fuck’s sake look at yourselves. Every day I come on here looking for discussion and all I see is anti-Starmer sentiment with almost anybody trying to speak otherwise getting downvoted. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not ‘Starmer till I die’ or a centrist/centre right AT ALL. He’s a very imperfect politician. I don’t necessarily trust him, then again I could say the same about all of them (yes, even Corbyn). Like everybody else I couldn’t really tell you a single solid policy he has going forward into the next election. But the last 12 years of Tory rule have been beyond catastrophic for us. The NHS is down on its knees. Austerity.  Brexit. Over 200K dead from Covid. Corporations and private companies seeing massive increases in profit while unions and ordinary people are being shat on. The tories are turning into the republicans with even abortion laws and human rights on the table ffs.

I don’t mean to undermine your concerns because I get it, he hasn’t been receptive to the left side of the party and what will stick of his pledges remains to be seen (a lot can happen in the next 12 months). Starmer might end up being 5-10% of what we want, but isn’t that better than Truss? Than Sunak or god forbid Boris if he gets his way and somehow wriggles back into number 10? Let alone the rest of the potential ‘leaders’. And in a recent poll wasn’t he 10+ points ahead? We’ve just had one of our worst losses ever for goodness sake and here we are ahead in the polls ready to tear ourselves apart again. 

Our voting system is archaic and broken but if we don’t put ideological purity aside and band together we will be out of power for another 12 years or more, and what the Tories will do to the country in that time I know will be 1000x worse than any centre right leaning labour leader.
