The Labour leadership must take stock of the weaponisation of fake anti-semitism by people inside and outside the party to perpetrate false images of reality.

Constant stoking of the fires of fake anti-semitism plays into the hands of Labour’s right wing, which has never reconciled itself to having a socialist as party leader, of the Tories able to parade themselves falsely as fighters against discrimination and of the Israeli embassy, emboldened to smear Jewish critics of its illegal colonisation of Palestinian land as anti-semites.

Until Labour defends itself strongly against false charges and tackles those spreading them, it will be fighting the Tories with one hand tied behind its back.


This is exactly what most of this current waving of the anti-semitism card is - weaponisation - purely funded to discredit detractors of Israel. It happens across the EU & the US - the enemy in the shadows and its time more people, and especially the media, began to square up to it!

Neoliberal,post,genocide,rxzpml,Sad_Test8010,We must restart and realign our foreign policy in a logical manner as in a new cold war with China.,"The doctrine after the fall of USSR was based on understanding the sensitivity of the reality that came about after the fall of USSR or Russia and it's desperation to cling to it's sphere of influence. Which may or may not mean much in real terms. But Russians are seen to act less rationally which is thier entire history choosing communism therefore not surprising. But this country which is not too rational has 5000 nuclear bombs. To not antagonise them would be rational even when they are significantly weaker. 

The US adopted the policy of not interfering on Russia's sphere for that reason even waited for Russian support for the first gulf war. That's why the first gulf war was such a success and the second a disgusting failure in the world's eyes. Same reason why America decided against interfering in the Balkans and stopping a near genocide militarily untill and unless Russia was on the same side. 

Bill Clinton reversed that and then followed a policy of chipping away Russia's sphere of influence making them less and less secure and more paranoid. A country which is already that irrational, is not a good thing to happen. 


The point of this is realpolitik demands that we will not get our perfect results. There has to be always sacrifices. The eastern Europe is going to be that. 


The correct strategy is quite easily visible. We should have reversed the strategy that was used with China against USSR. We used China against Russia. So, now we use Russia against China. Both were the biggest enemies, and animosity never dies easily they can be rekindled. And China and Russia are natural enemies. Russia as I said are desperate for protecting their interests in their sphere of influence, china is targetting that same region of central asia. What we should do is look how to escalate that. 


Russia is still full of potential. A country with 100 million people, where they have conscription and combined with 5000 nuclear bombs and the second best military.

LabourUK,comment,Palestine,i5oqiuq,KellyKellogs,,"I'd say you are missing a few things.

The first one is the Jewish national identity which was the foundation for the Israeli national identity and goes back 2000-3000 years to the multiple Jewish countries in Israel and then upheld throughout Jewish thought, prayer and books ever since.  The Israeli national identity was formed throughout the era of the Yishuv through the 1948-49 war and was really a national identity by the end of the war on top of the already established Jewish national identity.

The Israeli national identity really formed about 20 years before the Palestinian national identity and this is also a key reason as to why there was no Palestinian state post 1949 despite Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza being in Arab hands.

If the Haganah wins the 1948-49 war, the State of Israel is created but if the Arab armies win, then there would not be a State of Palestine but Palestine would have been carved up by the Arab regimes.  It was only after 1967 when Palestinian leadership started to fight for Palestinian Arabs rather than just Arabs and the weaker (or lack of) of a strong Palestinian identity, like there is today, between 1917 and 1967 is a major reason why Israel exists and the State of Palestine is still fighting to be free.",2022-04-22T00:17:14+00:00,t1_i5ofy62,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neoliberal,post,genocide,1b3do94,John3262005,Washington state’s largest labor union endorses ‘uncommitted’ over Biden,"The biggest labor union in Washington state endorsed voting “uncommitted” in the state’s Democratic presidential primary next month, citing concerns about President Joe Biden’s political strength and his support for Israel’s war in Gaza.

The deeply Democratic West Coast state holds its primary on March 12.

In a statement shared first with NBC News after its executive board voted on the endorsement Wednesday night, the Washington union called Biden “an ally to workers over the last four years,” but suggested it is not confident in his ability to defeat likely GOP nominee Donald Trump in November.

“Currently, many voters, and UFCW 3000 executive board, feel that the best path to have the best nominee, and to defeat Trump, is to vote ‘uncommitted,’” the union said in the statement. “The hope is that this will strengthen the Democratic party’s ultimate nominee to defeat Trump in the General Election in November.”

“We need a nominee who can run and beat Trump to protect workers across this country and around the world,” the statement continued.

The union made it clear that it will support Democrats in the fall, vowing it will be “sending staff, members, and resources to any swing state across the nation to support the Democratic nominee to win and defeat Trump.”

But the move by a liberal state’s largest labor union shows some parts of the Democratic base are still not fully on board with the president’s re-election yet.

The Washington union praised those who voted “uncommitted” in Michigan and said “Biden must push for a lasting ceasefire and ending US funding toward this reckless war.”

Meanwhile, The Stranger, a prominent alt-weekly publication based in Seattle, also endorsed the idea of voting “uncommitted,” expressing disappointment in the options of  Trump and Biden, whom it referred to as the “two genocidal geriatrics leading the polls.”",2024-02-29T22:36:40+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,

northernireland,comment,Israel,deq2g43,runawayvibrator,,"The Story So Far is that Jewish people lived in what is currently called Palestine a thousand or two years ago, but were conquered by a wide variety of other people and eventually sent into a known-world-wide diaspora. This is why you find Jewish people throughout the Middle East, Europe and Asia. The Jewish people are persecuted in most of these places, mostly because they are a minority and tend to keep to themselves, and occasionally take jobs that make other people not like you (e.g., bankers). That's another story though. The Jewish people manage to persevere, though, and consider the Land of Israel to be their homeland to which The Messiah will some day return them.

Around the late-1800s, some Jewish people got tired of waiting for The Messiah, and the Zionist Movement was founded. These were people dedicated to creating a Jewish homeland. Preferably in Israel but they were willing to negotiate. In the early 1900s they established a fund to help this happen.

At the time, Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire, and this fund was used to buy land (perfectly legally) in Palestine from the people who lived there at the time (the ancestors of modern-day Palestinians but then known simply as ""Arabs"") and start settlements into which Jewish immigrants were settled. Some of Israel's largest modern cities (such as Tel Aviv) were started around this time.

There was a law at the time stating that a settlement was legal if it was surrounded by a wall and had a watchtower. Jewish people would go over to unclaimed lands at night, and before morning would surround a large area with a wall and build a watchtower. Wham, instant settlement. And they did a lot of this right near Arab lands.
This was perfectly legal at the time, but obviously lead to some friction, as you might imagine. The Muslim Arabs were worried about a lot of Jewish people moving in next door.
In the 1920s, after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the newly formed League of Nations declared Palestine to be a British mandate. The British, well aware of the tensions between the Arabs and the Jews, tried to calm things down by simply disallowing Jewish immigration to Palestine. This lead to a lot of illegal immigration - Jewish people would cram into tiny boats and sail in under cover of night, to be met on the shore by established settlers. More overnight settlements popped up, and more tension between the Jews and Arabs, and the Jews and British! The Jewish settlers utilised a lot of terrorist tactics at this time. The whole thing was kinda chaotic.

Bottom line from all this is that the Arabs were worried/mad at the Jews moving into their territory, whereas the Jews believed they were fulfilling their destiny and moving back to their homeland - and were doing it (mostly) legally - buying lands, starting legal settlements, etc - until the British outlawed immigration (but even then, they were buying and settling legally).

After World War II, when the aftermath and absolute horrors of The Holocaust were revealed, the world decided that yeah, maybe the Jewish people should have their own homeland. The Balfour Deceleration, all the way back in 1917, had the British stating their support for establishing a Jewish Homeland in Palestine. The newly formed UN voted on this, and in 1948 the State of Israel declared it's independence.
The very next day, the entire rest of the Middle East started a war against them. They lost.
There were a few more minor wars after that. Then in 1967, there was a major one.
When I say ""major"", I don't mean by length. It is known in Israel as ""The Six-Day War"". In it Israel was attacked by seven of it's neighbours, who were thoroughly defeated to such a degree that Israel pushed it's own borders to more ""natural"" geographical areas - they pushed the border with Syria farther north, taking over the Golan Heights, with Jordan up to the Jordan river, taking over The West Bank and East Jerusalem, and pushed the border with Egypt all the way to the Suez Canal, taking over Gaza and the entire Sinai Peninsula.
So this kinda sucked for the Arabs living in The West Bank and the Gaza Strip. They were now part of Israel.
Israel actually tried to integrate them. Many received full Israeli citizenship, with full rights. the only exception to this was that they were exempt from military service.

Then, in 1987, it all went to hell.
It was one of those things that just escalates out of hand rather than people just sitting down and $%&* talking to each other. There were some problems at a refugee camp, both Arabs and Israelis being killed, then some riots, then an Israeli army truck hit a car, killing four Palestinians, and people decide it was intentional and molotov cocktails start flying.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Israelis,k4knn2t,ResidentNarwhal,,"I’m going to hard disagree and I think the 9/11 is a good comparison. The various intel agencies all had puzzle pieces showing “something big” was coming. But those pieces didn’t come together into anything actionable. Knowing “something is coming…at some point…don’t know how” isn’t functionally useful. And another big element in the room not being talked about as much as it should be is Irans role in planning and assisting in counter intel to hide the attack. 

The reason for the US missing 9/11 also follows: US agencies were through culture and actual legal structure poorly set up to share information in a comprehensive way that would allow leadership to put those puzzle pieces together. 

And those issues are currently mirrored in the Israeli security state. The Mossad and IDF have very much been coasting off reputation for the last 50 years. But there’s been a number of basic intelligence and strategic blunders made since the year 2000 that *should* have taken a little more shine off the pop culture opinion off them. The information about Netanyahu’s government have repeatedly shown a complacency, contempt for counter opinions and tunnel visioning on their current domestic squabbles. Particularly important is the major turnover in intel leadership due to politics and disregarding opposition intelligence experts as “being alarmist.”

Finally I don’t necessarily think it would be a net political 4D chess win for Netanyahu to “allow an attack he knew about.”  The Bush administration was largely forgiven and rallied around after “missing 9/11” because the complacency was completely shared by every American in 2000-2001. The presidential election was relatively recent and most of the intel on Taliban/Al Qaeda was prior to assuming office; 9/11 really is as much Clinton admin and civil-service-state failure as it is Bush’s. But Netanyahu has been in and around the Israeli government for *awhile*. He’s instrumental in the changes to the Israeli security service that dropped the ball.

Artsakh was an autonomous region under the the USSR, during which the Soviet Azeris tried to settle Azeris in the region but Armenians remained majority. When the USSR collapsed, Artsakh legally held a referendum for independence, and the Azeris responded by committing massacres and trying to invade the region. Armenia supported Artsakh's right to independence but it was a separate entity. Artsakh was the one Armenian province where Armenians had never been entirely massacred or deported, had continuously always been populated by Armenians for thousands of years, and which the most extreme Turkic irridentist had no right too. And then the world watched silently yet again while the turks were allow to genocide thousands of years of Armenian culture heritage.

Turkey invaded Cyprus and settled Turkish citizens on the northern part of the island, and a leading Turkish politician admitted Turkey did this because it would've ceased to be a regional naval power if Cyprus became independent.",2023-10-09T16:55:36+00:00,t1_k455gsv,,,,,,,,,,,,
Neoliberal,comment,Jews,k4psydj,fplisadream,,"I think there is just a reflexive belief amongst many that left = good person and so anything a leftist does can't be bad and anyone who does something bad can't be a leftist.  Of course you can't argue marx isn't a leftist so the natural response is to deny he had bad ideas.

Of course a sophisticated leftist might argue his AS was a product of his time and that it doesn't encroach on the goodness of his economic analysis but I think it still shows just how closely linked anti semitism and marxist/leftist ideology are. They are completely intellectually compatible and empirically frequently appear as bedfellows. 

I'd go so far as to say anti semitism is a natural extension of leftist thought, which effectively holds that all power is a result of a superstructure where the class with power embeds that power in servive of their class interest. You add to that analysis the contingent fact that Jewish people are overrepresented in traditional institutions deemed powerful (for reasons that smart people understand are not a conspiracy) and hey presto you have an anti semitic idea.",2023-10-13T15:17:18+00:00,t1_k4prdr6,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is meant to further the misconception that the holocaust happened at concentration camps like the ones shown in the video - and that these camps didn't have the capacity for the holocaust as it happened. 

However, the vast majority of holocaust victims were shot over ditches in Eastern Europe, or gassed in purpose built extermination sites in occupied Poland and Belarus. This is especially true for the extermination of the Polish jews cited in the document above. These sites were razed before the Allies, specifically the Soviets, would reach them. Which is why immediate evidence like the recordings you linked don't exist from the primary holocaust sites. Of course there is plenty of evidence still - but that doesn't stop the holocaust denier to point to footage of say Mauthausen and claim this showed that concentration camps couldn't have come close to killing millions.",2019-12-11T13:08:42+00:00,t1_fagoo9y,,,,,,,,,,,,

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Israel,h23u58t,Ostroh,,You have to do fairly frequent and very torough audits of their spending and operations. The auditing process must have teeth and hold legislators accountable. It must be done by an external organistation that is staffed by mostly carreer government employees and few political appointees in a position to influence the reports. Reports should be made public. The nature of the operations can remain mostly secret for a time but for example they should not be able to hide that they overstepped their role to the public. Whistleblowers should be protected from retaliation from the government and the organisation. The organisation itself cannot be the one to adjucate if a whistleblower is a traitor or not.,2021-06-17T16:32:02+00:00,t3_o1lgv1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Geopolitics,comment,Israelis,k453nu8,Fit_Instruction3646,,"I'll tell you how I view the history of the last 80 years. After WWII we had three worlds - the capitalist world led by America, the communists led by the USSR and the non-aligned world which was kinda led by China and India but was mainly an arena of competition between the USA and USSR. Of these, the First world was economically and technologically the most advanced, the second world was less advanced but hoped it could level up with the first world and the third world had huge potential but was hugely underdeveloped. After that the First world continued to make progress and it's lead over the rest of the world increased in the 50s, 
60s, 70s etc. The second world used to develop albeit slowly at first but then met a gross economic stagnation. The third world despite it's huge potential made hardly any progress at all.

All of this led us to a logical conclusion- the main reason for the success of the West were it's values - economic and personal freedom, democratic institutions and liberal values. After all, that was the main difference between the West and the Rest. The West was liberal, the Rest wasn't, the West was successful , the Rest wasn't. So liberal = successful. All other factors make hardly any difference or at least that was the dominant narrative in the expert circle.

Now if liberal = successful,  what is to be done? Well, the West should obviously just continue to do what it has always done and follow the liberal track while the Rest should adopt Western liberal values and institutions and this will automatically lead to it becoming as prosperous as the West. 

Needless to say, things didn't work out that way. Still, we needed some time to figure that out and return to the status quo of international political which is Great power competition. 

Now, the West viewed things the following way - since western style institutions are the only possible institutions which can guarantee growth and prosperity, all countries in the world will necessarily adopt those institutions and become part of the American-led world order. Those who refuse will either be doomed to perpetual poverty and irrelevance to the world system or face a revolution by it's peoples who would bring western-style democracies to power. Thus, globalization benefits everyone - the countries who participate will become more like the West and thus more aligned with the West politically. Those who don't participate will be left behind and either fade into irrelevance or come to their senses and eventually follow all the others.


From the POV of the rest things looked a little bit differently. Some people in those countries genuinely believed that the success of the West lied in it's institutions and wanted to build such institutions at home and eventually get closer to the West. Those are the people that the West relied upon to get into government and lead their countries closer to alignment. On the other hand, there were many other people in those countries who felt 0 love for the West or it's institutions but faced the cold hard fact that the West has a tremendous economic and technological advantage over all the others. So in order to be successful this advantage had to be stolen or replicated but without taking over western institutions and values. Eventually, both groups of people welcomed globalization because they viewed it as the only way they can get their hands on western capital, know-how and technology. 

So the great peace of the last 80 years was based on a simple (mis)understanding. The West believed that peace and free trade and knowledge transfer will lead to all other countries integrating into the West and cementing the power of the Western elites in perpetuity. The Rest believed that without mimicking the economic and technological development of the West, they will never manage to become equal to and eventually superior to the West. Those in the rest who were liberal believed they will be allowed to become equal to the West in the world system but the stronger they got, the clearer it became that the West had one simple rule - you either submit to us (like Japan did) or we will never accept you. And even after you submit we may still not really accept you - for example, many Eastern Europeans today feel second class Europeans despite being members of NATO,  the EU and being white and Christian.


So gradually two things became clear - globalization and free trade only lead to stagnation of the West and rise of the Rest. In the same time, the so-called free international system is not really free and is designed to perpetuate the power of the Western elites. You can grow and develop but up to a point. You may rise out of poverty but you won't be allowed to rise to actual relevance 

So this form of compromise is already spent - there is nothing left for both sides but to sabotage the other. The West must find a way to sabotage the rise of rival powers that may threaten it while the rising powers must sabotage the system that exists in order to rise to equality, supremacy and eventual domination over the West.",2023-10-09T15:26:53+00:00,t3_173pzrz,,,,,,,,,,,,
