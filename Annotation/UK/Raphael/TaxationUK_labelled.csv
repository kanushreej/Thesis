**Monday 12 March**

**Financial Guidance and Claims Bill - report stage and 3rd reading**
Creates a single body to help members of the public manage their finances, consolidating services that are currently provided by the Money Advice Service, the Pensions Advisory Service and the Department for Work and Pensions. Also gives the Financial Conduct Authority the power to regulate claims companies (like the ones that help people win compensation for personal injury), and transfers the responsibility for investigating complaints against these companies to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Started in the Lords, so if it passes these stages, it just needs the Lords to approve any amendments before it can become law.

**Tuesday 13 March**

**Spring financial statement**
This isn't a bill, but we've included it here because this is when Chancellor Philip Hammond delivers the government's latest economic forecasts. The Treasury doesn't want the event to be seen as a ""mini Budget"" (which happens in the autumn), so there'll be no red box, official document, spending increases or tax changes.

**Wednesday 14 March**

No votes scheduled.

**Thursday 15 March**

No votes scheduled.

**Friday 16 March**

**Unpaid Trial Work Periods (Prohibition) Bill - 2nd reading**
Bans unpaid trial shifts for workers unless they're given feedback on their performance and told how long the trial period will last, what qualities they need to demonstrate, how many jobs are available and how they'll find out if they're successful or not.

**BBC Licence Fee (Civil Penalty) Bill - 2nd reading**
Decriminalises the non-payment of the BBC licence fee.

**International Development Assistance (Definition) Bill - 2nd reading**
Changes the definition of international development assistance. Details beyond that are scant because a draft hasn't been published.

**Benefits and Public Services (Restriction) Bill - 2nd reading**
Restricts non-UK citizens' access to benefits and other public services.

**Electronic Cigarettes (Regulation) Bill - 2nd reading**
Regulates the use and sale of e-cigarettes. Also exempts them from any UK laws made as a result of the EU's Tobacco Products Directive, such as size limits on e-cigarette tanks and refill containers, requirements that they be child proof, and obligatory health warnings on packages.

**Criminal Fraud (Private Prosecutions) Bill - 2nd reading**
Relates to private prosecutions (when a private individual or organisation takes someone to court on a criminal charge) in cases of suspected criminal fraud. Details beyond that are scant because a draft hasn't been published.

**Affordable Home Ownership Bill - 2nd reading**
Requires the inclusion of rent to buy homes in the definition of affordable housing, ensures a minimum proportion of new affordable housing is available on affordable rent to buy terms, and abolishes stamp duty for rent to buy homes.

**Hospital Car Parking Charges (Abolition) Bill - 2nd reading**
Abolishes car parking charges at NHS hospitals for patients, staff and visitors.

**Universal Credit (Application, Advice and Assistance) Bill - 2nd reading**
A wide-ranging bill reforming the universal credit system (benefits for those who are on low incomes or out of work). Among other things, it requires the government to pay claimants within a month of a valid application being been made (subject to some exceptions), outlines minimum payment options that must be explained clearly to claimants, and allows terminally ill claimants to continue receiving payments without having to work.

**Courts (Abuse of Process) Bill - 2nd reading**
Allows family and civil courts to throw out applications where they deem that a perpetrator of domestic abuse, stalking or harassment is using the claim to try to contact their victims.

**Pedicabs (London) Bill - 2nd reading**
Allows Transport for London to regulate pedicabs (bikes with a trailer attached for carrying passengers). Includes a wide range of possible regulations, including licensing, fares, safety, working conditions and speed restrictions.

**Domestic Properties (Minimum Energy Performance) Bill - 2nd reading**
Requires the government to ensure that all domestic properties have a minimum Energy Performance Certificate rating of C (with exceptions). The deadline is 2030 for homes occupied by people in fuel poverty and 2035 for all other properties.

**Vagrancy (Repeal) Bill - 2nd reading**
Scraps the Vagrancy Act, a law from 1824 that makes it illegal to sleep rough or beg.

**Clean Air Bill - 2nd reading**
Requires the government to set and enforce air quality targets, and reduce air pollution using clean air zones (among other methods). Also introduces new laws about vehicle emission testing and restricts the sale of vehicles with certain engine types.

**Registration of Marriage (No. 2) Bill - 2nd reading**
Introduces an electronic system for marriage registrations and allows details of the spouses' mothers to be included. Note: the bill itself doesn't make these changes. Instead, it allows the government to do it by introducing new regulations.

**Voter Registration (No. 2) Bill - 2nd reading**
Bans people from being registered to vote in parliamentary elections at more than one address.

**Kew Gardens (Leases) (No.2) Bill - 2nd reading**
Extends the length of time Kew Gardens is allowed to lease land for to 150 years, from 31 years currently. This could include residential or commercial use. The aim is to help Kew increase its self-generated income.

**Rivers Authorities and Land Drainage Bill - 2nd reading**
Among other things, allows the government to establish local rivers authorities, which would deal with flood risk management. The bill is aimed at turning the Somerset Rivers Authority (which was formed in response to the floods of 2013 and 2014) into a statutory body.

LabourUK,post,tax rate,nq3a71,MMSTINGRAY,John Rees: The Class Struggle Under New Labour (July 1997),"I'd expect more of this from Blair as he continues to court Blarities

>Let’s take one small example of this process. In late May Tony Blair attacked the salary rises of the directors of the lottery operator Camelot. They were hauled before Chris Smith, the national heritage minister, to explain their conduct. At one level a properly cynical response to this development is quite right: it is cheap progressive publicity for Labour and, in any case, Blair is close to Richard Branson who wants to take over the lottery and run it as a non profit making operation (although the ‘consumer friendly’ publicity will generate lots of profitable business for the Virgin empire). Certainly it is right to say that no anti-capitalist intent is visible here. Anyone who claimed that there were such intentions would be painting Blair in colours far more favourable than he deserves.

>But that is far from being the only important argument about this issue. It is at least equally important to note that if a Labour prime minister attacks the salaries of the directors of one nationally prominent corporation it cannot help but give encouragement to every shop steward and union activist to make the same point about the managers and directors of their company. What seems like the promotion of illusions can turn into the inspiration for resistance. As the old adage has it, life looks very different depending on whether you view it from the cottage or the castle.

>Of course, it is only the fact that working class consciousness had already moved to the left before the election, and that this move was bolstered by the election result, that allows this interpretation of events. If there were no such consciousness among workers then Blair’s manoeuvres would never have effects contrary to his intentions. But as such a consciousness does exist much of a socialist strategy depends on recognising the contradictory impulses of Labour’s statements and exploiting them to the advantage of rank and file workers. Concretely, in this case, it would be a mistake if every resolution over pay and conditions in every union in the country did not make use of Blair’s attack on the directors of Camelot to sanction action against directors in other firms who have enjoyed similar rises over recent years.

>This kind of approach is all the more important because Blair quite deliberately follows an approach which combines either small reforms, the appearance of reform or the rhetoric of reform with policy which is wholly reactionary. Thus Blair talks of a ‘People’s Europe’ in which ‘there is less obsession with ourselves and our institutions, more focus on the things that matter to people’ but, in reality, he refuses to support the social chapter in the new European treaty unless if encourages ‘flexible labour markets’ (ie low pay and job insecurity). Yet these are the very things that most trade unionists think the social chapter will alleviate. Similarly, Blair’s priority of ‘education, education, education’ is already being used by teachers and parents campaigning against Labour’s plans to close schools, ‘fast track’ the sacking of teachers, and send in ‘hit squads’ headed by the very man, Chris Woodhead, who became hated as the head of Ofsted under the Tories. Or again, the government’s decision to lift the ban on unions at GCHQ can give confidence to every activist trying to organise a non-unionised workplace, despite the fact that Labour is committed to keeping the Tory anti-union laws which make the task so difficult.

>These contradictions are going to repeat themselves across the entire front of government policy. Blair and his advisers are keen to emulate Bill Clinton’s ‘tough love’ approach, described by The Guardian’s Larry Elliot as an ‘anomalous mixture of liberalism and authoritarianism. The Prime Minister will be Tony, just as Bill Gates of Microsoft is Bill, but the jeans and open necked shirt approach has to co-exist with ruthlessness ...’ [4] Peter Mandelson seeks to exploit this contradiction to Labour’s advantage, almost matching each reactionary policy with an announcement of some cosmetic or superficial measure which appeals to the progressive sentiments nurtured by Labour’s victory. The vestiges of political control may be removed from the Bank of England but, don’t worry, Labour will run an ‘ethical foreign policy’. Single parents will be targeted for ‘welfare to work’ interviews but at the same time Clare Short plans to ‘end world poverty’ by freeing overseas aid from being tied to business deals. Refusal to tax the rich is coupled with the windfall tax on the profits of the utilities.

>This public relations operation is already seen for what it is by a very substantial proportion of Labour activists. For some, doubts about Blair have not been alleviated by the scale of the election victory. And as time passes it will be the hard core of pro-capitalist policy which emerges as by far the dominant, and obviously dominant, part of the New Labour equation. The full force of circumstances pushing Labour in this direction will become clear when we examine the economic prospects facing Labour (see below). Here it is only necessary to note that Blair is ideologically committed to allowing the ‘full rigour of the market’ to do its work.

>It was this commitment to the market which stood behind Blair and Brown’s decision to make the Bank of England independent, as Larry Elliot explains:

>This change … underpins Labour’s technocratic approach to running the country. Once you have dispensed with the idea that conflict is natural – even healthy – and that there are [any] real class or sectional interests, the answer to every problem is to call in the experts. It makes perfect sense to hand over the interest rates to the Bank of England and to call in the head of BP as minister for export promotion. They are, after all, likely to make a better fist of things than elected politicians. [5]

>Since this was written Martin Taylor, chief executive of Barclays Bank, has been appointed to head a Whitehall team on tax and benefits, and Lord Hollick, chairman of United News and Media, has been called in to advise on industrial policy. Indeed Blair has been forced to admit that he has made more political appointments in Whitehall than the Tories did. He also looks set to have more unelected ministers in the Lords than the Tories, making a mockery of the election pledge to reform the upper house. In this world ‘independent’, ‘expert’ and ‘neutral’ are simply euphemisms for free market economics.

>Blair and Brown and the massed ranks of their advisers will stick to this element of their project long after the elements of superficial radicalism have been swept away. It is an article of faith among the Blairites that ‘corporatism’ was to blame for keeping Labour out of power for 18 years and, more broadly, that ‘planning’ was the root of all evil in the Stalinist states. They are consequently much more ideologically committed to market solutions than the previous generation of Labour right wingers.

>This pro-market stance puts them on a trajectory diametrically opposed to both the interests and the consciousness of the vast majority of people who voted Labour. Yet it would be a mistake to assume that, even when this contradiction becomes sharper than it is today, such a conflict will result in the Blairites giving way or changing course. One only has to recall the ruling classes’ free market policy, in particular the defence of the gold standard, followed by Labour’s Ramsay MacDonald and Philip Snowden in Britain in the inter-war years, to see that no amount of evidence of failure, or working class discontent, or even the wrecking of their own party, is necessarily enough to make Labour’s leaders shed their belief in the market.

>Moreover, these pro-market attitudes are much more than an economic orthodoxy. Every aspect of Blair’s social policy is riddled with the same assumptions. If there is unemployment it can’t be the fault of the market, it must be a result of welfare (described by new minister Frank Field as ‘the enemy within’). If there is ‘choice’ in the supermarket, why not ‘parental choice’ in education? And if ‘choice’ isn’t working it must be the fault of lazy teachers and failing schools. If young people are breaking the law the answer can’t be a job or a decent wage, it must be ‘fast track sentencing’.

>Even a commentator as sympathetic to the Blarite project as The Observer editor Will Hutton finds Labour’s orthodoxy unsettling:

>The Conservative vote may have fallen to the lowest since 1832, but the lesson drawn by some at the top of the Labour Party is not – in social policy at least – that neo-conservative approaches to welfare and work should be qualified. Paradoxically, they should be intensified.

>For these Labour zealots, Hutton argues:

>… systems of social insurance become obstacles to work because those who use them become scroungers and welfare cheats...welfare must become conditional upon effort, and offer no more than a safety net between jobs; if inequality results, it must – like death and taxes – be seen as an unavoidable fact of life about which the community can do nothing. [6]

>In both social policy and economic strategy the contradictions between the needs and desires of working people and the direction upon which the new government is set can only grow sharper. But even today, in its current unstable form, these contradictions open up opportunities for socialists, if they know how to take them. This requires that where Blair is at his most reactionary – in his Downing Street meeting with Thatcher, in sending the hit squads into schools, in freezing public sector pay – the left should unequivocally condemn the government and explain how its policies are linked to its acceptance of the very same capitalist priorities that the Tories were thrown out of office for defending. But this criticism will be all the more effective if we take some of Labour’s pronouncements as the basis for arguing against the government. Is spending £13 billion on the Trident missile system and another £3 billion on a new class of nuclear submarine, for instance, an ‘ethical foreign policy’? Is it an ‘ethical’ domestic policy when we are told there is no more money for hospitals and schools? If it is wrong for Camelot directors to increase their own six figure salaries by 30 percent, is it not also wrong to put an academic who ‘earns’ a six figure salary in charge of the commission which will decide the level of the minimum wage? Even before the election, an editorial in The Independent pinpointed exactly the kind of paradox Blairism creates:

>... New Labour’s bid to have capitalism and all its works without its ‘cultural contradictions’...strives to produce rules for social life when economic life is less rule-bounded than ever. The question is whether government can impose these rules ...

>Mr Blair would like parents to spend more time with their children. Quite right. Does that mean that he is in favour of maximum 48 hour weeks, or new laws to force employers to recognise the domestic circumstances of their staff? [7]

>Such arguments can gain a substantial audience now. The probable economic prospects mean that the size of that audience is likely to increase the longer the Labour government lasts.

A central question will be about your housing because prices vary dramatically across the UK. Your best option is probably to buy one and I imagine that would mean selling the one you have. So the value of your current home is important. Or whatever you rent it out for if you decided to keep it and rent here. 

It's easy to go online and look at houses for sale in the UK to get an idea. 

Another Redditor said that many people in the UK retire to the south coast. This is true but property there is expensive - Brighton is nearly up to London prices. 

Living rurally in the UK normally requires running a car. But I'd say you can do that on your budget.

There are various areas in Scotland that could work for you. More remote areas are lovely but living there can work out more expensive. Scotland has a lot of relatively affordable houses - away from the main cities. And buying a house in Scotland is very straightforward. In England it's complicated and messy. 

The cost of houses in Aberdeenshire went down by quite a lot because of the slowdown in the oil and gas sector. But it can be a great area to live in.

The risk the landlord takes is that the property is empty. If it's empty, it's obvs not anyone but the landlord paying the council tax.

LabourUK,comment,income tax,k275zlp,ItsGloomyOutThere,,"I certainly see your point about everyone benefiting from free childcare. I suppose education and healthcare are seen as human rights in a way that government subsidised childcare isn't, especially if you can afford it. To tell you the truth though, I haven't really pondered this one a great deal. Probably because I don't as of yet have any kids. :) You make a fair case though.

My point about the taper is that at the moment a family with a household income of £100k a year may be worse of then one with £99k, for example. With a taper, by the time you've run out of free childcare it's been at least somewhat offset by a significant rise in income. :)",2023-09-25T21:57:31+00:00,t1_k25umey,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

I’m a gay man and pubs have never been my favourite place to be, partly because they’re just so dominated by  (straight) men. I think the atmosphere would be much nicer if there were more women and the pubs can actually be more profitable, as they’d have a larger clientele.

Besides that, there is really nothing wrong with encouraging young men to meet young women in a pub-like setting. I feel like pubs are probably a better space than clubs where everyone is way out of it.",2023-09-29T14:12:37+00:00,t1_k2ps2ee,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
