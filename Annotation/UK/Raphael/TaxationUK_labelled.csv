Scotland,comment,tax,jrqfc6c,MassiveFanDan,,"> Tuition fees shouldn‚Äôt be free, but also not as huge as down south.

They didn't used to be so huge down south.  When they were first brought in they were meant to be capped at ¬£3000 a year.  That was Labour's pledge - that was the top limit.  But all the profiteers needed was a foot in the door, a crack in the wall...  As soon as you bring the profit motive in, people will seek to increase their profit margin.  

This was predictable, and was indeed predicted by the opponents' of tuition fees in the Commons at the time (such as the SNP), but there were just too many people like yourself who said ""Tuition fees shouldn't be free"", so now we are where we are.  Or at least, students down south are where they are.  

What is it now?  ¬£9000 a year?  Told ya.

>Prescriptions either, was fine before they changed it.

Having universally free prescriptions works out cheaper for the taxpayer, since it cuts out the need for means testing, which would require administrators and an administrative system.  Having them be universally free costs us *less* public money.  It's baffling why fiscal conservatives always seem so keen to land themselves with the worst possible deal on public services (limited, but still expensive, means testing).

AskUK,comment,tax rate,i4y708q,,,"I‚Äôve actually done extensive research around this - which is why I cannot possibly fathom how you have such a skewed perspective. 

Cabinet is not the same as MPs. They‚Äôre hand selected. You could have a government with only 4% privately educated MPs and a cabinet that is 100% private educated. Again - you‚Äôre using misleading statistics. 

> You need to do a bit more research check allowances pre 1979 Google it

On a high level, the UK ranks:
- Better than the US, New Zealand, Portugal, Italy and Hungary. 
- Similar levels around New Zealand, Japan, Canada, Australia and France
- Worse than Nordic Countries (renowned as world best) plus Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria


You know‚Ä¶ **none of those countries have a tax rate close to 83%**‚Ä¶ which was the basis for your entire argument 


> Check out gov statistics for judges, Barristers, senior Medics and other professions

Again, this just shows you‚Äôre not literate at reading these statistics. Of course‚Ä¶ positions which **require** 30+ years of experience are more likely to have bias in them. It doesn‚Äôt mean society today is unequal‚Ä¶ just that it was 30 years ago.

> check out the governments own website or the OECD

OECD data shows that the top 10% to bottom 10% relative income has largely stayed the same. It shows that the median income vs top 10% has slightly gone up which is good (only down spiking in 2020 due to the pandemic). 

Funny though‚Ä¶ because Norway‚Äôs median income has actually gone down relative to the top 10% (becoming much closer to the UK). They have a much higher standard of living for their really poor though‚Ä¶ but the UK welfare system is one of the best in the world‚Ä¶. not as good as theirs but certainly better than the likes of the US.

Luckily for us most of our advantages are things that cannot be taken away.

1. Tax is verifiable lower than peer countries - This gives us room to raise them much further (17% away from Germany) and fund anything we please, if we decide so.So we could pay 10% more in tax, NHS would be fully funded, we would afford a proper police, army would have the funds needed, UNI could be made free.
2. Demographics are better, check fertility rates (I believe only france is slightly better)That means we have roughly 20-30 years before it becomes critical, we can sit and observe who else solves it and replicate their success.
3. Geographic location - far away from any enemies like Russia and quite shielded from climate change

If any of you come to the US and break your leg, they will be obligated to fix you up despite not being a citizen).  

There are limits to how much wages can be garnished (no more than 25% of income) but it is still a broken system.  And although if you really are penniless or nearly so they can't actually do anything to get money out of you, the costs get passed on to everyone else, so yeah it sucks.

Although it is worth noting implementing a tax on private schools doesn't preclude other tax increases elsewhere.

> And if only a quarter of private school kids move to the state system this policy costs the government money instead of making it money.

These types of analysis ignore the fact that the number of children going to our schools is actually reducing due to population cohort reduction, having a small influx of ex private school kids come into the state sector helps keep schools open.",2024-05-27T13:02:14+00:00,t1_l5vksda,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's not only the Eastern or Southern European countries that have an interest in keeping the ultimate authority within the nation states instead of moving it up to the EU and so limiting the mechanisms for EU rule enforcement. Basically always leaving the possibility of rejecting EU rules if they feel strongly about it.

For the smaller and less powerful countries no matter where they are located or how rich the fact that they might get overruled by the EU in the future may keep them from wanting to give the EU the ability to impose too forceful a punishment for anything. Bigger countries like Germany can be more secure in knowing they can never be fully overruled if they really put their foot down but even they will prefer to have the power remain with them rather than the EU.

Which is why any serious changes to a more forceful EU are unlikely.",2018-04-08T19:43:27+00:00,t1_dx0xczk,,,,,,,,,,,,

For those who do not know about it, there's a relatively new alternative VAT system called ""Flat Rate"" where you pay less than 20% to the taxman and pocket the rest. You lose the ability to claim back any VAT on your own expenditure but it doesn't matter in most cases because the set discount you get (determined by what industry you work in) is far less than anyone could ever claim back! This eliminates a massive amount of paperwork for the business and HMRC as well as completely eliminating a very common avenue for fraud. 

It is staggeringly brilliantly clever. I had to read it many times before accepting that someone in HMRC was so smart. They've used the carrot instead of the stick, making the favourable option for all parties to also be the path of least-effort. ",2013-02-11T20:13:04+00:00,t1_c8dbwi4,,,,,,,,,,,,

* A nationalised industry is often a subsidised one, but this creates an unusual incentive where more customers (or more customer consumption) means *less* profit for the government which dissuades investment.

* Nationalised industry is monopolistic, so one can't go to a competitor and seek a better deal or even just a service that's more appropriate for one's needs. Likewise, lack of competition discourages innovation - which can already be stifled by institutional bureaucracy even in the private sector.

* Some of the so-called ""natural monopolies"" are entirely artificial - for instance the railways were built by dozens of competing rail companies, nationalised and then ""rationalised"" which saw ""redundant"" routes abolished thus creating the ""natural"" monopolies we have today.

It's also the case that the government is already powerful enough to achieve most of the aims of nationalisation if it really wanted to - and conversely some of the profit-maximising incentives could apply to it.

For example, a nationalised British Gas might do exactly the same thing as in the OP, but waive those charges for pensioners since they vote more for the incumbent government - thus extending the more general policy of transferring wealth from the young to the old.",2022-08-10T13:01:23+00:00,t1_ijmmpb0,,,,,,,,,,,,

unitedkingdom,comment,PAYE,kgaiq88,kujiranoai2,,"If you want an answer to these questions I‚Äôd research two topics - inequality and neo-liberalism.

A good place to start on inequality would be books by Danny Dorling who is a geographer and statistician and Professor at Oxford University. He‚Äôs recently written a book called Shattered Britain that‚Äôs pretty spot on for your questions and has written other books on inequality in the UK. Bottom line, the UK has become an incredibly unequal society, the trend beginning in the mid seventies and getting worse ever since. Inequality covers both geographic and social inequality - if you took London out of the figures the rest of the UK is poorer than Mississippi for example. An enormous if not all of the benefits of growth in recent decades have gone to a small minority of the already rich.

Neo liberalism is the ideology behind the political choices that have created this inequality - Liz Truss was Neo Liberalism on steroids. I would try books by David Harvey or one coming out by George Monbiot soon or search on goodreads.com for a book list.

Gary Stevenson - a former derivatives trader now campaigning against inequality is interesting to listen to as well. https://youtube.com/@garyseconomics?si=IbULqPTtBmc-7XVh",2024-01-04T15:55:10+00:00,t3_18yacqt,,,,,,,,,,,,

AskUK,comment,PAYE,l5gv9on,Plumb789,,"Absolutely dreadful, but it can happen.

I once went to a ‚Äúdinner party‚Äù given by someone I didn‚Äôt know particularly well, and was surprised to discover that the hostess had pre-ordered takeaway (no choice or consultation with any of us-or any warning given about food intolerance/expense/taste preferences/dietary requirements etc).

When the food came, we were then all asked to ‚Äúpay our share‚Äù. A woman next to me (who I didn‚Äôt know) was clearly absolutely mortified and asked me to lend her the money. It was such a weird scene watching people sitting round a dining table, set with lovely table linen, crockery, glassware and cutlery, getting our purses out to pay the hostess.

The place was an incredible home (which, at the age of 25, the lady owned outright) stuffed with fabulous furniture and artwork (it looked beautiful, actually). She spent the evening talking about her ‚Äúmulti-millionaire‚Äù father and brother. We were all poor as church mice at the time.",2024-05-24T13:27:14+00:00,t3_1czge3f,,,,,,,,,,,,
