LabourUK,post,referendum,wjnjfq,JacobJamesTrowbridge,You are not immune to propaganda.,"Over the last few weeks, this sub has seen a  couple of recurring themes; principally, they boil down to ""I hate Keir Starmer and want Corbyn back"" and ""Here's a Leftie sucking Russia's geopolitical dick, don't do that"". I'd like to point out, quickly, that media infiltration is absolutely a tactic of modern political parties, and of modern intelligence agencies.

Last month on r/Science, someone posted a study by a conservative 'research' group that claimed sex reassignment surgery was linked to increased suicide rates. The 'study' was nonsense, based on nothing more than Google search trends, yet it showed up in Hot with no upvotes and about $20 worth of gold and silver awards. It was taken down only after several hours and thorough reprimand in the comments. 

In the recent Kansas abortion referendum, Republican groups sent out texts across Liberal areas, claiming that abortion rights in Kansas were under attack, and urging readers to vote 'YES' on the referendum; 'YES' was the opposite vote, and some voters were tricked into voting to rescind abortion rights. 

I imagine you'll all remember how many people were suckered into the 'Ghost of Kyiv' story. Personally, I was one of them. 

So as I watch this sub repeatedly attack its' own party members more than the opposition (guilty, your honour) and dish out criticism of America's enemies, it might be worth taking a step back at who might really be behind the username. The mods can only do so much.

Edit: Just got a notification that this post has 25 upvotes, yet it only displays a total of 2 votes on the post itself. So it looks like I've struck a nerve on this one.

Edit 2: Oh for fuck's sake, I think half of you saw the word 'Starmer' and went fucking cross-eyed. I'm on the left, I oppose him as much as anyone, but I'm pointing out that  criticising the party leader at every opportunity is also advantageous to the tories. Yes, he deserves criticism. Yes, he's like Blair with somehow even less principle. But that's not the point I'm trying to highlight.",2022-08-08T23:25:41+00:00

Geopolitics,post,referendum,8apofd,Dr_Jorge,Territorial disputes: the Falkland/Malvinas islands,"Last week marked the 36th anniversary of the Falklands/Malvinas war. So many years later, deaths, deep scars, generations, financial blockades, politicians using them on both sides of the Atlantic and there is no hint of a definitive solution.

Argentina does not accept the islanders in any negotiations. The United Kingdom maintains de facto sovereignty and claims to support the wishes of the islanders. The Falkland/Malvinas islanders made clear in the 2013 Referendum they wanted to remain as an Overseas Territory under British sovereignty. Yet, the referendum was not legal. And the story goes...

I'm originally from Argentina. I currently live in the UK (I've been here for the past 12 years). I have been in touch with Falkland/Malvinas islanders since before 2013. In fact, I supported the 2013 Referendum and I had the opportunity to have some of the islanders writing on my blog. One of my cousins (now dead) fought in the Falklands war in 1982. I don't have any grudge against the UK or the islanders. In fact, I've always wished for a peaceful resolution. 

I've been an academic for over 20 years. Publications in English, Spanish and Russian. I've been working on the Falklands/Malvinas case for over a decade. This includes research, writing (academic and non academic), public presentations, and other activities. In all the cases, I've done my best to keep a balanced view and avoid bias.

Can we do anything for peace? A reminder to the reader, this is a series I called TERRITORIAL DISPUTES. I introduced basic conceptual elements and thereafter, I apply a theoretical frame (based on Rawlsian methodology) to solve well-known sovereignty disputes or conflicts. I explore what reasonable people would do in a territorial dispute. This is a theoretical experiment that deals with IDEAL theory only. There is no claim to NON IDEAL theory hence issues like lack of compliance are not explored.

In order to do it, I assume the representatives of each claiming party (sovereign States and a non-sovereign character) choose a rule based on theory game. I go for the maximin. From there, these ideal people come up with a solution to the conflict.

These past two weeks I introduced the Falklands/Malvinas' case and applied the Rawlsian methodology to this dispute. Below all the links to all TEN posts from this week. The first four posts have to do with background information related to the dispute itself in order to set the stage for hypothetical negotiations. The fifth post introduce my solution which I call EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY. Posts six to nine deal with borders, defence and natural resources and I argue how cooperation by means of the Egalitarian Shared Sovereignty can work. Post ten brings back reality and argues that this dispute has to do with domestic, regional and international issues at states. My conclusion, this dispute remains because for some (very few) it is more beneficial the status quo. 

Questions for the readers:
1. Any disagreement with the facts?
2. Any information or opinion you may want to share?
3. How can we solve this territorial dispute?

REMINDER Note: I’ll only post on r/Geopolitics on Sunday a summary of what I do weekly on the blog to avoid spamming this sub-reedit as that is not my intention. I only aim to open a healthy discussion.

Comments welcomed. Guest writers would be hugely appreciated. As you may see from the posts Falklands/Malvinas islanders have previously participated. PLEASE I do this with utmost respect to all people in Argentina, the United Kingdom and the Falkland/Malvinas islands. I'd appreciate the same respect in the discussion. I don't claim to have the solution. As I've just mention, I only aim to offer an open floor for discussion. Enjoy!

Libertarian,post,immigration,121i6ct,ForlornMemory,Why does government need the perpetual growth of economy?,"I'm start from afar. After researching this topic for a bit, the statement that ""as population of the country is constantly growing, the economy needs to grow as well so that people wouldn't get poor"". But I find a problem with this explanation and that is that the population doesn't actually grow naturally. It mostly grows due to immigration crisis and artificial inflation. 

So we have the following picture: the government allows people from third-world countries to immigrate and then use social programs to possibly avoid working entirely. It obviously does it to compensate the lack of natural growth and also increase the percentage of people that are dependent on social security programs and government that allows them to not work. In return the immigrants spend money the government gives them (the money it takes away from working citizens) thus helping the economy to grow. Otherwise those money would probably be used for savings or stuff like that, and that is very bad for the perpetual growth. 

Another thing government does to ensure the growth is 5-7% of annual inflation that abolishes the ability to save money and thus forces people to spend it on goods now rather that save it for later. 

&#x200B;

So, my question is, what does the government gain from it? I have my thoughts, but I'm really not sure of them so I'd like to hear what are your thoughts on it. 

Also, do you think we, as middle class working people, need the perpetually growing economy? If so, explain why.",2023-03-25T10:50:12+00:00

Libertarian,post,single market,bmbtac,DuhNotConjuring,Libertarianism a cancerous ideology,"I love this Subreddit because there is always so much stupidity to make me laugh. Libertarianism is such an absurd ideology. Hey remember that Libertarian president? Me neither... 

I won’t just make fun of it. Let’s look at 10 reason of common Libertarian ideology.

1. Taxation Is Theft - No it’s not. People have a right to these public programs. The police and government agencies need to be paid too. Having a government has a cost.

2. Unregulated Free Market - Right so we can go back to the 1920s with child labor, unsuitable work conditions, and little pay. No thanks. And no work licenses? You really want a doctor to performed surgery who isn’t licensed. Yeah, me neither. People can lie about products, rip off, and companies could work together for price fixing. 

3. Gun Access - I don’t see how people don’t want more gun control. More guns a house are more likely to be used in a homicide, suicide, or accidental discharge, than they are used for self defense [(Source)](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/guns-in-the-homesafe-storage-statistics/). There is no reason why anyone needs an AR15 or AK47. These guns have killed people in mass shootings. When Australia banned its gun in 1996, they had no mass shootings. 

4. Social Programs - I can’t believe Libertarians want people who are dependent on Medicare, Medicaid, and unemployment to be done away with. Old people can’t work and paid into Medicare. And people who are disable and unemployed need an income to live, already work full time and don’t make, or can’t work. It’s more complicated then “getting a job”. 

5. Drugs - You think someone should be able to inject meth into themselves and kill someone and have no punishment. Drugs are illegal to protect the public. 

6. Universal Health Care - It’s the job of the government to protect its citizens. That should include our health, and we pay for it through taxes. Most European counties a single payer system and it works well. And before anyone brings up how long it takes for someone to see a specialist in or the long waiting time at hospitals in Canada. That country is the exception, not the norm. 

7. Unregulated Pollution - From what I’ve seen from Libertarians is that for the ones who believe in global warming, you guys think the government shouldn’t enforce reasonable regulations do carbon emissions. So much for trying to fix the the issues. I guess it’s up to the magic force of the free market.

8. Public Schools - We should do away and let the “free market” fix the issue right. After all if the poor can’t afford, fuck them right. It’s Social Darwinism and that makes it okay...(PS I was being sarcastic.)

9. Abortion - This is for the pro-life Libertarians You believe people should do whatever they want to take away women’s rights using government force. Talk about being hypocritical.

10. Free Speech - You guys think you can say whatever you want and no one can do anything about it. A person can tell bomb, and get away with it. A person should be able to watch and share the New Zealand massacre and spread hate. A person should be able to make a bomb. A non-binary gender person goes to the doctor and the doctor refuses to acknowledge that. That’s what I was happy when CA passed SB-219. 

To sum it up, Libertarianism is a cancerous ideology and is unrealistic.

UPDATE: Libertarians showed me how much Libertarianism fails. So many responses, yet not a single comment addressed my points. Instead you guys attempt to epically fail to make fun of me. This shows that Libertarianism ideology fails so much because none of you can make a case for this idiotology.",2019-05-08T22:28:25+00:00

Geopolitics,post,immigration,5s415o,19djafoij02,"Is the divide between Muslim and non-Muslim fertility rates in parts of Northern, Western, and Central Europe an issue? If so, how should it be managed?","[According to these Pew statistics](http://i.imgur.com/YkZN6s6.png), the following developed European countries have a) an above-replacement fertility rate for Muslims and b) a below-replacement fertility rate for non-Muslims:

Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK

(The Balkans are very mixed, with this trend occurring in Serbia, Kosovo, and Montenegro but not in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Albania, Macedonia, or Romania; all other European countries polled saw fertility below replacement levels for both Muslims and non-Muslims)

I only see three possible outcomes here:

1) Muslim populations rise as the non-Muslim (""white"", Afro-Caribbean, Armenian, Indian, Chinese, etc) populations decrease. This often results in pushback from ultra-nationalists.

2) There is a significant crackdown on Muslim immigration; however, without resolving the fertility issue the population ages and declines, often having negative effects on the economy and potentially resulting in a rise of nostalgic ""Make ____ Great Again"" ultra-nationalists. This has happened in Japan, Russia, and Poland in recent decades.

3) The balance is tipped back in favor of non-Muslims through some combination of:

a) increasing birthrates (hard to do when there are concerns about world population and Westerners consume so much resources)

b) increasing net overseas adoption rates (relies on other countries being willing to give up their babies for adoption)

c) decreasing Muslim birth rates (hard to do along religious lines without violating all sorts of human rights norms)

d) increasing net attrition from Islam to other religions or belief systems (including atheism), or moderating the strains of Islam practiced in this country (probably the least troublesome of these solutions imo but still very delicate).

Is this a real problem or a hysteria for these countries, and if it is a real problem (outside of the racist far right) how should it be handled?",2017-02-04T23:18:31+00:00

China GDP Growth Forecast 2019-2024 and up to 2060

Both Forecasts are by World Bank, OECD and IMF.

I know that trends aren't always indicative of what will happen. But people were saying that China's nominal GDP would pass the US much earlier (in 2005, it was predicted that they would pass the US even earlier, and now it's 2028). With that being said, China's economy will surpass the US because of the sheer population differences. It just won't be the 3-4 times the size like trends list that didn't include slowing nominal GDP growth.

So, anyone worried about Chinese Hegemony is mistaken. Since both will end up around the same GDP, US's superpower status is not in doubt (USSR economically was less than half of the US). Sure, it's in a relative decline as the rest of the world is becoming more developed, but in absolute terms, it's power is not declining at all. The US had the world's largest economy since the late 1800s, but didn't become a superpower until 1945. Not to mention the fact that the US has far more allies like the EU, Taiwan, Japan, CANZUK, SK, Vietnam, India, etc. 

China is becoming a superpower. There's no doubt about that. But will it become a world hegemon like the US or Britain before it? Absolutely not.

And yes, the list indicates that the demographics situation in China will have a profound impact on China. And no, China is an authoritarian Han supremacist ethnostate that is committing genocide (Sinicization) on the Uyghurs and will not mitigate this with immigration.

Libertarian,post,single market,2pmtyq,falcon4287,Are unions good for a free market? (long post),"As a former conservative, I had of political stances to reconsider when I was first met with a paradigm-shifting revelation that opened me up to the ideals of libertarianism. Among those stances, my opposition to unions remained steadfast with little consideration put towards it, as that seemed to be the view of both conservatives and libertarians without much question.  

I don't remember exactly what got me thinking about it, but I did at one point catch myself playing Devil's Advocate and trying to make a point when the normal berating of ""go find a job that pays more if you're not happy with the pay you have"" started falling on a Walmart worker. It crossed my mind that if everyone was to leave and find a new job that paid more, or if Walmart were unable to hire new employees because the pay was not enough, that would drive Walmart to raise wages because, as the world's largest employer, maintaining fully staffed locations is a very high priority for them.  

So, if leaving your job for one that pays more is the way of the free market, then why is it anti-capitalistic for a group of employees to cumulatively tell their employer that their pay is not enough and they will be forced to leave for higher paying jobs if they don't receive wage raises? That, *at it's principal*, sounds like exactly how wages should be raised in a free market, if not the *only* way, since the government shouldn't be forcing the raises and the companies have no incentive to do so even as cost of living rises unless the employees force their hand.  

Now, I'm not here to defend unions and they way they operate. I'm just here to defend the *idea* of unions, as groups of workers that collaboratively enforce companies to keep wages current. If they ask for more than they company can afford, the company should just let them quit and they can hire new employees that are willing to work for those wages. And as long as new employees are willing to be hired on at those wages, then those wages are reasonable by definition of the market (not particularly true in action, but on paper).  

So where does this go wrong and why are unions actually anti-capitalistic in practice? Also, how is a lack of unions anti-working class in practice? And most importantly, is there a middle ground that works on paper and holds up in practice?  

Simply, the idea of unions crashes when the unions lobby to the government for minimum wage hikes rather than playing the game the hard way with the corporations by haggling on a middle ground. The corporations can't exceed a certain wage, or else they lose money or have to cut future programs (companies need lots of growth to sustain themselves, breaking even is certain death for most companies). Likewise, employees can't drop below a certain amount, which varies based on the job, but at its lowest is the local cost of living for a single person in a small apartment with no dependents. It's reasonable for this ""minimum"" to be higher based on the job itself and the quality of employee required by the company (pickier hiring requirements should equate to higher wages). The system also fails, as most systems do, when one or both parties fail to adhere to reasonable conditions. Demanding $15/hr for a job that requires no prior experience or any form of resume when there are people working entry-level IT jobs that require a college degree for the same or lower pay is a prime example of not adhering to reasonable conditions. This doesn't even touch the blackmail portion of the union when the jobs are held by people who can't easily be replaced, or when timing is used such as the Black Friday Walmart strikes. Most of those, however, are just bluffs by people who would come crawling back if they were actually fired for not showing up.  

In practice, pro-corporation and anti-union views also fall apart. Sure, leaving the company for one that pays more is *always* an answer, right? No, not really. There are always people who will gratefully take a job that pays well below a living wage as supplemental income rather than primary income, and that would likely drive wages much lower than minimum wage if allowed, and give companies the stance that someone is willing to work for those wages, so they must be reasonable. Maybe they're willing to work those wages because it's not their primary income stream, or maybe because they simply need a job and $6/hr is better than $0, as is often noted in defense of corporations. But is that right? I'd say not, because in this scenario, the employee has no say over their own wage, not even through action such as quitting and finding a new job. Being grateful for having a job doesn't mean that the company is a savior, just that the company lowered their wages enough to not be picky about their hiring prospects.  

So what should libertarians think about unions? Well, in my humble opinion, wages should be an agreement between two parties, not one party holding the other party's bollocks in a vice-grip. *Both* unions and corporations like to take turns having that stance against each other rather than actually looking at the other party and being willing to compromise. We've seen both happen, when employee and product quality plummets due to low wages, and when companies file bankruptcy trying to meet union demands. Walmart has managed to stay sane in all this without any unions, keep afloat financially, and pay employees competitive wages with benefits. So maybe what we've learned from practice carries more weight than what we discuss in theory, and that seems to point towards an organized workforce made entirely of employees that deal with corporations directly about wages.  

So, what's the difference between an organization of the workforce that talks to the corporation about employee wages and benefits and a union? A union is a body that arbitrates between the workforce and the corporation, not a body of the workforce itself. And what does that middleman do? It uses its position to leverage money and power away from both sides towards itself. Unions are anti-capitalistic, but they have ruined the image of what such a body could be- the very thing that makes a free market work. Worker strikes that are organized by the workforce are ultimately the best thing shy of a workforce with a present body in shareholder meetings. Strikes are the employees' way of doing just what we ask them to do, but retroactively- ""if the job doesn't pay enough, don't take it."" If it *did* pay enough but hasn't changed with the economy, strikes are a decent way to handle it.  

------------
So to recap/tl;dr:  
**Unions**  
* Leverage companies for their own gain  
* Don't compromise and cost workers their jobs  
* Not pro-capitalism  
**Corporations**  
* Put the company first  
* Won't think to give raises unless pushed  
* As long as someone is willing to work that wage, it's a reasonable wage  
* Does not adhere to free market ideals  
**Vocal Workforce**  
* Doesn't take fees from employees  
* Not a third party/ self-representation  
* Is willing to take less than what they ask for  
* Follows libertarian economic model, supporting both capitalism and a free market economy for labor  

Please weigh in, not that I have to ask.

AskUK,post,immigration,1bs6lsw,professorwormb0g,Do you guys ever eat Italian American food?,"Hey m8z! 

So I'm an American of Italian heritage and I'm thinking of this question because tomorrow I am going to have a pretty traditional Italian American Easter Dinner with my family.  I'm especially pumped for the Italian [pastries](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTv1w2uMTuswmV67fqP8fDRJNXvXMDk6_10EWC167Pgzw&s).  😁

You might be familiar with Italian-American culture from TV shows and movies like The Sopranos.  Food is clearly a big part of it, but because of many factors the cuisine is quite distinct from the cuisine of modern Italy, although certainly not unrecognizable. Regardless of the split, Italian-American folks  have a lot of pride in our food (and other) cultural traditions.  

Has any [Italian American food](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian-American_cuisine) made its way to your side of the pond?  Spaghetti and meatballs, American style pizzas, chicken parm, alfredo, buffalo style wings, Italian subs? 

I know you have chains like pizza hut, but what about a NY style deli or pizzeria, for example?

I ask because I know the US and UK exchange a bit of culture with one another because of our common history, values, language etc.  I also know Canadians too have Italian food like we have it, and even Australians to an extent based on what an Australian friend has told me (since they have a decent chunk of Italian immigrants too.)

Part of the reason it evolved the way it did was because Italian immigrants took the anglo cultural bedrock of the US when they came over and combined it with their own food traditions; adapting it based on the ingredients available.  And then it continuously evolved from there and continues to today.    

If Italian American cuisine is **not** common there, have any of you eaten it while visiting the Northeast of the US (or even southeast of Canada)?  I'm biased because it's what I grew up eating the most of, but I think the best food in the northeastern United States comes from the Italian Americans.  Many cities and areas even still have their own variations and specialty Italian dishes in the US that have stayed quite local even.  Makes road trips fun!

Thanks for reading and taking the time to answer.",2024-03-31T09:45:38+00:00

Libertarian,post,single market,g4ekpo,adjusticemoon,Can't Afford Your Rent?,"TLDR: there is no one single cause of the real estate supply crunch and corresponding lack of affordable rental housing OR more examples of how Boomers have used government to screw millennials...

On top of extensive federal, state, and local regulatory burdens which drive up costs, Trump's trade war increased the cost of building materials, and his abhorrent immigration policy reduced the labor supply for home construction, increasing the cost of development, and therefore decreasing new home construction. 

Even before the global pandemic, there was significant uncertainty and an expectation of an economic contraction, decreasing the number of sales listings on the market. Since the outbreak, new listings have fallen in most markets. For example, San Francisco is down 38% with the biggest drop in California.

Fewer newly constructed homes and fewer existing home sales might not have been a huge problem if it weren't for high demand, especially with the FED dropping the FFR like it's hot. 

Most of the crunch is at the entry level of real estate markets. There's plenty of luxury housing >$1M, but good luck finding your starter home near your job. 

Millennials currently own only 4% of real estate — at their age, boomers owned 32% of the country's real estate. Boomers subsequently prevented new development and are enjoying the resulting increased equity. Many millennials are desperate to enter the real estate market and finally accomplish homeownership.

With competition high, buyers (of all ages) are engaging in bidding wars, and hot properties can have multiple offers within days, so real estate prices are increasing. If buyers are not forced out of the market by price, it's by lack of supply, and they must therefore rent.

The demand from would-be home buyers for rentals compounds existing rental supply issues, such as rental regulations (see new laws in California, for example) that encourage landlords to switch to vacation rentals, or not rent at all. Preventing an increase in the supply of multifamily rental housing is probably the primary of purpose of some NIMBY zoning boards. High-demand locations see increasing rent, and long-term residents are priced out of those rental markets. These folks must move to lower cost rent locations, and tend to pay the difference with their commute time. 

The pandemic didn't suddenly cause this supply crunch. Even without challenges to performing real estate activities like quarantine and social distancing, local markets are each unique, adding more layers of complexity. While the above may be true for major metros with healthy job markets, it's not necessarily the case in rural areas. 

Most real estate brokers and agents are hoping the spring market is merely delayed, and we'll be able to make up for missing it later this year. If prices increase enough, it could encourage new sellers to enter the market. Increasing unemployment and decreasing economic activity could reduce demand and lead to a drop in rental prices. However, with the current climate of economic uncertainty and political partisanship, this California Realtor is not very optimistic.",2020-04-19T20:15:44+00:00
