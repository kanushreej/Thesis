europe,post,biodiversity,3j8yww,czokletmuss,Future of Europe and consequences of global warming,"I found an interesting article (for a lack of better word) on consequences of global warming on Europe:

> **HIGH TEMPERATURES**

>Global warming will have serious consequences for human health, biodiversity, ecosystems and the goods and services they provide, as well as for many social and economic sectors, including agriculture, tourism, and energy production.

>More frequent high-temperature extremes, such as hot days and nights and heat waves, as observed and projected, will affect human health. **This could lead to an increase in the cases of temperature-related mortality, as already experienced in recent heat events.  Especially vulnerable sectors of the population, such as the elderly and infants, will be affected the most.**

>Warming is affecting the distribution and abundance of many plant and animal species (insects, birds), which already show problems in adapting to the changing climate. Mountain areas are particularly affected. The behaviour and phenology of animal and plant species is also changing: this could lead to greater numbers of pests, invasive species, and the incidence of certain human diseases, while the yields and the viability of agriculture and livestock, or the capacity of ecosystems to provide key services and goods (such as water reservoirs, natural erosion control) could be diminished.

>Warmer temperatures increase the risk of desertification in southern parts of Europe, and they also cause a greater risk of droughts. Temperature extremes will therefore affect sectors such as agriculture, tourism and energy production. Cities can face new challenges for supply of water and other basic resources. Low-temperature extremes (cold spells, frosty days) could become less frequent in Europe, and milder winter temperatures might also reduce winter deaths. However, global warming affects the predictability of events and therefore our response capacity.

> **WATER AVAILABILITY**

>Climate change is expected to affect water availability and increase water scarcity throughout Europe. Changes have been observed in river flows, with reductions in southern and eastern Europe, and increases or seasonal changes in other regions.

>With fresh water originating mostly in mountain areas (e.g. **40% of Europe’s water comes from the Alps**), changes in the snow and glacier dynamics and in precipitation patterns **may lead to water shortages across Europe. These diminishing water supplies will also have a negative impact on hydroelectric power**, which is the principal energy source for large areas of Europe.

>Water scarcity, together with other climate change effects such as droughts, will have a direct impact on citizens, especially in highly urbanised or densely populated areas and the coast. Changes in water availability and quality will affect critical EU sectors such as tourism, agriculture, industry, energy, and transport. Environmental effects are expected to affect biodiversity, water quality, and aggravate the risk of forest fires, soil degradation and desertification.

> **FLOODS, DROUGHTS, LANDSLIDES AND OTHER EFFECTS**

>In most of Europe, less precipitation in summer and rising temperatures will lead to more frequent and intense summer droughts. **The Mediterranean region is already experiencing these effects, and is expected to suffer from more extreme droughts in the coming decades, together with other regions, such as central Europe.**

>Greater droughts, heat waves and dry spells across most of the Mediterranean region will increase the length and severity of the fire season, the area at risk and the probability of large fires, possibly enhancing desertification. Locations currently not prone to fires could experience this catastrophic hazard and become risk areas.

>Climate change will increase the chances of flooding in some regions of Europe. **Flood damage is expected to rise across Europe.** Meanwhile, some north-eastern parts will become less flood-prone due to a reduction in snow accumulation.

>River floods are a common natural disaster in Europe, and along with storms have resulted in fatalities, affected millions of people and delivered massive direct economic losses in the last three decades. Climate change is likely to increase the occurrence and frequency of flooding across Europe in the coming years.

>Heavy rainstorms are projected to become more common and more intense due to warmer temperatures. **Flash floods and pluvial floods**, triggered by local intense precipitation events, **are expected to become more frequent throughout Europe.**

>In some regions, certain risks, such as early spring floods due to reduced snow accumulation during winter, could decrease in the short term, but new risks associated with climate change may offset positive effects in the medium term.

> **SEA-LEVEL RISE AND COASTAL AREAS**

>Sea level has been rising over the 20th century, and the tendency has accelerated in recent decades. This is due mostly to thermal expansion of the oceans as a result of warming, but also to extra water addition due to melting ice. As global temperatures rise, coasts will become more vulnerable to flooding and erosion.

>Around a third of the EU population lives within 50km of the coast and these areas generate over 30% of the Union’s total GDP. **The economic value of assets within 500m of Europe’s seas totals between €500-1,000 billion**

>Sea-level rise, together with other projected effects of climate change such as changes in the dynamics and energy distribution of waters or on the frequency and intensity of storm surges will increase the risk of flooding and erosion in coastal areas, with significant consequences for the people, infrastructure, businesses and nature in these areas.

>Among other potential impacts, **sea-level rise is projected to reduce the amount of available freshwater, as sea water pushes further into underground water-tables**; it will likely lead also to much more saltwater intrusion into freshwater habitats, affecting biodiversity and the services and goods that coastal areas provide. Many wetlands areas will be lost, threatening unique bird and plant species.

>There is a greater risk of flash flooding in mountain areas and their downstream valleys as a higher proportion of precipitation flows straight into river systems.

Scotland,post,temperature,p0eqyd,chilliswan,Perfect place in Scotland for me,"Hello, 

I'm a 21 year old Slovenian, who has a dream to live in Scotland some day. However, my girlfriend and I would not wish to live in a big city like Edinburgh. I visited Scotland 2 years ago and fell in love with its nature. My dream place to live in is:

* *not* by the seaside,
* can be by the lake (not necessary though)
* *not* a big city
* it snows in winter (at least from the start of December to the end of February)
* a bit hilly, maybe some mountains (flat landscape just isn't for me)
* cold temperatures don't bother us

I was looking all over the internet and figured out you guys could help me finding such place. Thanks for your help. Cheers!",2021-08-08T13:35:06+00:00

**The week kicks off a day earlier than planned, with tributes to Prince Philip.**

When the Queen Mother died, it was a two-hour session with  speeches from the prime minister, party leaders, Father of the House,  and certain backbenchers who had a personal connection.

**The big government bill to watch is the Domestic Abuse Bill.**

It's been a long time coming (remember it got carried over from  the last Parliament), and there's still some difficulty getting it  through.

The government was defeated on nine points in the Lords. Issues include adding domestic abusers to the sex offenders register, as well  as amendments on protecting migrants and bringing carers within the  scope of the Bill.

Watch to see how many of the changes the government tries to reverse. Peers have a bit of leverage because the end of the  parliamentary session is approaching, and any bills that aren't passed  or carried over will get killed.

### MONDAY 12 APRIL

*No votes scheduled*

### TUESDAY 13 APRIL

**Road User Charging (Outer London) Bill**  
Prevents the Mayor of London from imposing charges for driving in  Outer London. This is in response to the Greater London Boundary Charge, a proposal by the Transport for London to charge vehicles at least  £3.50 to enter the capital. (It's a separate thing to the Congestion  Charge, the Low Emission Zone, and the Ultra Low Emission Zone.) Ten  minute rule motion presented by Gareth Johnson.

**Finance (No. 2) Bill - 2nd reading**  
Implements the changes announced in the Budget.

### WEDNESDAY 14 APRIL

**NHS Pay Award (Report) Bill**  
Requires the government to present a report to Parliament if it  wants to increase NHS pay by less than 2.1% in 2021/22, and to have MPs  vote on it. (Ministers have currently proposed a rise of 1% in England.)  Ten minute rule motion presented by Carolyn Harris.

### THURSDAY 15 APRIL

**Domestic Abuse Bill - consideration of Lords amendments**  
A wide-ranging bill aiming to tighten the law around domestic abuse. Among other things, it establishes a legal definition for domestic abuse, creates the position of Domestic Abuse Commissioner and bans abusers from cross-examining their victims in family courts.

unitedkingdom,post,environment,kv2mn2,quentinnuk,What to do if your employer is making you come to work against Government guidance.,"A number of commenters on r/unitedkingdom and r/ukpolitics have raised issues with their workplaces insisting they attend the workplace rather than work from home when it is perfectly possible to work from home or their workplace is not adhering to covid safe measures such as social distancing or face masks. I am not a lawyer, but I am a senior workplace manager with a proactive public sector employer and here is some advice that is given for employees:

Section 44 of the Employment Rights Act requires employers to provide a safe work space and you have the legal right to withdraw from the workplace if it is not safe. If you have a concern about your working environment or your employer asking you to work on site when you could work from home you should:

1. raise the concern with your employer first wherever possible (keep a record of this)

2. raise the concern with a union rep if you have one

3. Report the issue to the HSE https://www.hse.gov.uk/contact/concerns.htm and also the local council Public Health team https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contacts-phe-health-protection-teams

4. If the issue is obviously in breach of the law (not guidance - unfortunately work from home is guidance at the moment), then you can report it to the police https://www.met.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/c19/v7/tell-us-about-a-possible-breach-of-coronavirus-covid-19-measures/

I hope you find this useful.",2021-01-11T13:28:00+00:00
AskUK,post,environment,1bfjgil,smooth-cacti,How do I help my dad cut down on binge drinking?,"So my dad (58) has a binge drinking problem. He works away 4 nights a week as a truck driver so does not drink through the week but on the weekend he drinks excessively - probably about 16 strong beers (6-8% strength) and usually about 1-2 litres of a spirit like southern comfort whiskey, over the course of Friday and Saturday. His weekend revolves completely around drinking and he always finds excuses to not go out with his family to enjoy a meal or go to the cinema etc.

He will drink well into the early hours of the morning like 5am and play loud music so the rest of the house (me, mother and brother 25) can’t get a decent nights sleep and gets confrontational if we ask him to use headphones or lower the volume. We have tried all sorts to help him stop drinking like making plans to go out to visit new places on Saturday/ Sunday, we’ve tried removing all alcohol in the house but he will hide alcohol and drink it in secret. There’s nothing he seems to want to do to stop or reduce his alcohol consumption. 

Aside from the amount of alcohol he’s drinking he’s developed some health issues - he has an enlarged liver and needs to get scans for his kidneys and more blood tests - he has also lost a concerning amount of weight (4 stone/25kg) in around 5 months and we’re all worried it’s part of a bigger issue. He has also been caught lying about attending doctors appointments to my mother when actually he goes out for a few hours then comes home. 

We’re all really worried he is drinking himself to death. Some weekends he can’t get upstairs to bed and will pee himself on the couch downstairs when he’s asleep. This obviously causes huge arguments and an uncomfortable home environment. 

How would you approach the situation? Is there any organisations I can reach out to etc? Also I am aware a similar post has been made in this sub recently. So this is a bit of a vent as much as it is asking for advice. Thanks! ",2024-03-15T17:30:10+00:00

unitedkingdom,post,fossil,x3x0tv,Tyler119,UK Energy by Source Vs France,"A common argument I see on social media is that France have capped energy increases at 4% and so the UK gov is just ripping off the UK people.  I'll admit my instinct was to see it the same way.  Then I began to look at how our energy is produced compared to France.   I used a few websites and regularly keep an eye on both below, 

[https://grid.iamkate.com/](https://grid.iamkate.com/)

[https://www.rte-france.com/en/eco2mix/power-generation-energy-source](https://www.rte-france.com/en/eco2mix/power-generation-energy-source)

&#x200B;

In general, France gets around 70% of its electricity from nuclear power which is indeed mostly state-owned through EDF.  This has been designed as a matter of a longstanding energy policy in France.  Compare that to the UK where we didn't build as they did.  Instead, we generate only 17% of our electricity from those power plants ([https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-trends-and-prices-statistical-release-27-january-2022#:\~:text=Gas%20provided%2041.9%25%20of%20electricity,1.1%20percentage%20points%20to%2044.6%25](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-trends-and-prices-statistical-release-27-january-2022#:~:text=Gas%20provided%2041.9%25%20of%20electricity,1.1%20percentage%20points%20to%2044.6%25)).  Over 40% is generated from fossil fuels, mainly gas.  Which is imported and then burnt at gas power plants.

&#x200B;

I see the argument that we should just nationalise the energy providers (Bulb pretty much is) and that would solve part of the issue.  However, I don't see how that would help short term as our energy policy is still ineffective as the Uk will still be at the mercy of the global energy markets.  If we had built a robust nuclear capacity then our energy bill hikes would be much less.  I fear that regardless of the government this issue won't be tackled and in the 30 years, another generation will be looking back and saying the UK still had a failed energy policy.  Another failure is that each provider buys its power individually rather than a central agency purchasing enough in advance for the UK and each provider selling it at a price that could create proper competition.  Our NHS gets great prices on drugs because it uses its whole purchasing power.  Yet for something as vital as the energy to heat our homes that does not happen.

It seems really easy for us to look across the English Channel and get upset that the French are not having such large price increases.  Yet, not the media and certainly not people on social media are diving into the real context and potential solutions.  In the last few years, people would rather post clickbait or emotionally charged article links to predictable online news sources.  The real discussion is lacking and has been replaced by soundbites.  Reddit was seen as a place for real discussion yet to an extent it too is now dominated by soundbites and clickbait.  Many get angry at politicians for doing the same yet behave the same way online.  

I would love to see some detailed responses to the energy issue in the UK not just tomorrow but for the long-term energy security of our country.",2022-09-02T09:28:35+00:00
