nhs,post,gp,1csgz7o,FactorConsistent6069,Moving hospitals advice ,"Hi. 

I've had a terrible experience with a hospital relating to the treatment provided by them. I made a formal complaint and they've basically responded    
Blaming everyone but the Dr's instead putting the blame on the nurses and not answering the questions. 

Also the chief executive signed off the summary but its completely filled with inaccurate information, can I send my formal complaint directly to their email?

Honestly I could have the papers print these issues but at a later date. 

Right now the main issue is moving to a different hospital, how would I go about switching my care to a different hospital. Who do I contact would it be my GP or someone else.

Questions are:

1. Can I email the chief executive directly if the summary she signed is filled with inaccurate information.

2. Who do I contact about moving my care to a different hospital, do I need to share my experience with them.


Appreciate you reading this. ",2024-05-15 09:53:49+00:00

unitedkingdom,post,gp,fjbg42,AutoModerator,Daily Discussion for Coronavirus (COVID-19) - 16 March,"**UK Megathread**

/r/uk Megathread for all COVID discussion. Please use this thread to discuss any and all COVID related topics. We would ask that you don't submit new posts for the topic on the subreddit itself - especially selfposts. Please only submit new subreddit posts for substantial news. While high-quality discussion is always preferred, memes, images and low-effort posts are absolutely acceptable on this thread. [Comic relief](https://b3ta.com/challenge/coronavirus/popular/) is especially welcome! 

**General Advice**

* Current UK Government strategy is the acceptance that containing the virus is not possible. It is instead considering measures (i.e. banning mass events, asking the elderly to isolate) that manage the spread speed, and thus to ensure the number of concurrent urgent-care cases does not swell beyond the NHS's capability (aka 'flatten the curve'). Thus, if you are relatively healthy, going about your day as usual, and are not taking proactive measures, there should be some reasonable expectation of catching the virus at some point in the future, but do not be concerned.

* If you believe you are infected, please use https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19 as your first port of call. Do not try to visit your GP. Call 111 only if the website advises you to do so as it is understandably suffering from high call volumes, thus struggling to answer those with genuine needs.

* Consider minimising physical contact with those which are more vulnerable, such as those with [comorbidities](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/examining-factors-that-worsen-coronavirus-severity).

* Wash your hands, for at least 20 seconds each time. Ideally with hand sanitiser or soap.

* Stockpiling goods without good cause is inherently selfish. You may be depriving vulnerable groups of vital supplies.

nhs,post,medicine,fwedzc,mcdj,Moving from the US to the UK to work in medicine?,"My wife and I have always dreamed of moving to the UK, or possibly Ireland (she has extended family there).

My wife is a pediatric neurologist with an Ivy League medical degree (and a massive debt to go with it).  I work from home.

A couple of things have been holding us back from leaving the US. 1. My wife's student loans, and 2. The understanding that she would need to re-certify or re-train to practice medicine in the UK.

We used to live in NYC, myself for 30 years and my wife for 15. We loved it there. It didn’t feel like America. It felt like a global city. We felt very insulated from much of the backward thinking and anti science this country is famous for. But we couldn’t afford the ever rising costs of living there. We rented a tiny, crappy, old rent stabilized apartment and moving anywhere nicer would have been cost prohibitive. Plus the city was getting too crowded.

So we moved to Chicago, where people are nice and all, but we definitely now live in 'Murica. 

Add to this our rapidly increasing exasperation with our president and his supporters, we’ve had enough. This rusty old strip mall of a country isn’t just depressing, it’s becoming dangerous.  We want out. 

We'd have to find a way to fast track paying down the student loans.  We understand that she would probably be looking at a pretty substantial pay cut to work in the UK. She currently makes just over $200K.

Can anyone shed any light on the process of being allowed into the country to practice medicine?  Have the rules become any more relaxed given the current situation?  Are there any NHS admin on this sub who might know where a pediatric neurologist who specializes in epilepsy might most be needed? 

We’d love to live in the Yorkshire Dales, Devon, suburban London, or perhaps somewhere in Scotland.  Anywhere a bit leafy within walking distance to a pub really.  But we’d consider anywhere that would have us.",2020-04-07 04:57:22+00:00
Scotland,post,gp,od37qf,JMASTERS_01,Scotland COVID-19 Vaccination Update,"This post is to give some reassurance to people concerned about Scotland's vaccination program and give some optimism that we are on track to vaccinate all adults (who want it) with at least one dose by the 18th July and subsequently move to Level 0 on the 19th July.

Yesterday, the government [announced walk-in vaccine centres](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-57685365) for all those aged 18 and over to help boost the vaccination program. The letters system, which I'm sure we all know about, rightfully has its critics but it worked well for the older cohorts for the first phase of the vaccination program and was less successful with younger age groups (in that as they're more likely to have outdated GP addresses,  it led to missed appointments). To combat this, registration portals were opened and yesterday walk-in centres were announced to all adults. This will help push the vaccination program along.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Firstly, some of you may have noticed that we are vaccinating less than usual, don't be too alarmed by this because as the following graph shows, this is seen across the UK, indicating that this is more of a supply issue than anything else. (Which we were [made aware of](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-57433760)) Thankfully though, this will not last long and we are still on track to [meet targets](https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19366606.covid-uk-minister-confident-scotland-will-get-enough-doses-meet-july-target/).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[ 7 Day Average of Vaccine Doses Administered by Day and Nation, Per 100k Pop - Source:https:\/\/www.travellingtabby.com\/uk-coronavirus-tracker\/ - As can be seen, across the UK fewer vaccines are being administered, though not for long.](https://preview.redd.it/v4nqbeot71971.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7165b87c3b0ea45151f55a8086d2a7afc388909)

&#x200B;

Secondly, Scotland is not actually vaccinating less or behind the UK, as can be seen by the graph, the weekly increase of vaccine administration  per 100K is slightly higher in Scotland:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thirdly, here is the UK wide vaccination programme, Scotland is doing well in its vaccination program and thankfully, the letters system blunder doesn't seem to have affected Scotland too badly:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Percentage of Population Vaccinated - Source: https:\/\/www.travellingtabby.com\/uk-coronavirus-tracker\/](https://preview.redd.it/x2sn78dt91971.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=e12786c47a7a87eff7553ec62ce818ecb82cbd96)

&#x200B;

And here is the worldwide comparison with every country with a population of at least a million:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Vaccination Coverage By Country - Source: https:\/\/www.travellingtabby.com\/uk-coronavirus-tracker\/ - As can be seen, Scotland is number two in the world \(with countries with at least one million population\) and the UK, in general, is doing very well with its rollout.](https://preview.redd.it/4lkwof42a1971.png?width=430&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f9b4b5ae6f7c91105b37a2527104956d651b117)

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

**So how are we doing per age group?**

&#x200B;

Most age groups are very highly vaccinated with the last remaining one being the 18+ group which are currently being vaccinated, however, some people in other age groups are still getting vaccinated (e.g. 30+ age group but to a smaller extent)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Vaccinations by age group - Source: https:\/\/www.travellingtabby.com\/scotland-coronavirus-tracker\/](https://preview.redd.it/eo8gbyksa1971.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=246028f3cc2a24628b99acff39b4c9cbcc79ea72)

&#x200B;

**And what about per council area?**

&#x200B;

Most council areas are pretty much in the finishing stage with 90%+ vaccinated adults and are focusing on second doses and younger age groups, the cities with higher younger populations are lower down the list but are expected to pick up as young adults get vaccinated.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Adult Vaccination Coverage by Council Area - Source:  https:\/\/www.travellingtabby.com\/scotland-coronavirus-tracker\/local](https://preview.redd.it/0kvzg60cb1971.png?width=388&format=png&auto=webp&s=5993b9795712c8b1f0ab2bcebb7d77d408192bc5)

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

The current vaccination rate is  **265,682** a week, which is lower than the Government's targets of 400,000 a week, due to supply issues.

&#x200B;

A vaccination rate of 265,682/ week means that every month **1,062,728** people would be vaccinated.

A vaccination rate of 400,000/ week means that every month  1,600,000  people would be vaccinated.

&#x200B;

(take with a pinch of salt as weekly vaccination rates are always fluctuating and are never really constant)

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

**Vaccine Milestone Dates:**

&#x200B;

**18th July -** All Adults who want it vaccinated with at least one dose

**26th July** \- All over 40s to be fully vaccinated

**20th August** \- All over 30s to be fully vaccinated

**12th September** \- All Adults to be fully vaccinated

[source](https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-update-first-ministers-statement-22-june-2021/)

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

In conclusion, we're nearly there, we are doing well with our programme and are on our way to better times. Please get vaccinated, if you have any doubts, speak to your GP.

&#x200B;

I hope you found this useful, and that it provided you with some optimism.

&#x200B;

europe,post,medicine,8my3lv,alyssas,Why the #eurocrisis had an unstable ending - and could return. A simple summary for folks who weren’t old enough the first time.,"It's from the following thread:

https://twitter.com/MMQWalker/status/1001323251673501696?s=19

>The #eurocrisis got real when Italian & Spanish bond markets began unraveling in 2011-12. Capital flight had a self-fulfilling dynamic, like bank runs on countries, and no action by national govts could stop it. /1

>Belgian economist @pdegrauwe had warned that such a dynamic was an unforeseen, potentially lethal flaw of the €zone - and that only the ECB had the firepower to break it, by playing bond-buyer of last resort. /2

>And so it came to pass. Draghi said he’d do “whatever it takes” and markets believed him, ending the self-fulfilling dynamic and the existential phase of the #eurocrisis. /3

>But Draghi only felt able to expand ECB mission in this way once he had a green light from Berlin. (Here’s how he got it despite vigorous Bundesbank opposition: https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443507204578020323544183926 …) /4

>To earn German & ECB support, Italy & Spain had to show they were serious about fiscal retrenchment & other overhauls. Merkel - and therefore Draghi - can only justify backstopping governments that play by the rules, incl. on deficits. Otherwise too much moral hazard. /5

>(In Greece, Syriza failed to learn this lesson, so it was taught to them again in 2015.) /6

>Thus in 2011 Berlusconi had to go as Italian PM, and technocrat successor Monti had to show Italy was taking bitter medicine. Ultimately it was all about persuading Merkel to let Draghi unleash the ECB. /7

>Problem: Monti’s austerity measures (mainly tax hikes) deepened Italy’s slump. Italy still hasn’t recovered from its double-dip recession during the crisis. /8

>And many Italian voters blame the economic scars since 2011 on austerity, Germany, EU institutions & financial markets. /9

>So the argument for fiscal and rhetorical restraint, made by Italy’s deeply unpopular establishment, is more likely to anger than to persuade voters who see it as subservience to Berlin, Brussels, Frankfurt and “lo spread.” /10

>Lega & M5S have no serious plan to leave the €. (You can’t. Not without burning your country down.) But they sense they can now slaughter the feeble establishment in snap elections by painting them as stooges of the nasty Germans. /11

>When Lega/M5S finally get into govt, I do not know whether they will walk the talk. How radically they will break with European fiscal rules in reality? How much is posturing? /12

>How much risk will they take for domestic political gain? Do they fully understand the risks? Or are they self-deluding like Syriza in 2015? /13

>But if they govern as they’re currently talking, then they will be acting without an ECB safety net. /14

>And if debt investors think the safety net is gone, then the unstable Draghi-Monti-Merkel #eurocrisis settlement of 2012 will be history. /end of thread & possibly Europe as we know it

A person who usually makes use of their common sense suddenly needs to have the consumption and ingredients of basic medication spelled out for them in great detail.  Why don't they read the instructions???? Why do otherwise considerate people feel ok about everyone behind them waiting twenty minutes because they suddenly need to have to be coached through the process of taking twi tablets twice a day? What makes such behaviour acceptable in the chemist but out of order everywhere else?

Edit. I'm not talking about people worried about a very serious issue,  namely their health,  asking reasonable questions.  Obviously medication can have serious effects if used incorrectly,  sometimes  fatal.  I copied this comment from another Redditor as they can better explain the type of behaviour I'm referring to.  

""Had someone in front of me the other day, was prescribed travel sickness medication by dr, lady asked the pharmacist if the directions the dr gave her were correct, and then asked the pharmacist how to use them. Then went on to tell the pharmacist how she takes them when she’s used them on previous holidays.

As another commenter has said, people are concerned about their health etc, however some people really lack common sense, and the person I witnessed wasn’t new to that medicine and had been told how to use it, and still asked for a lecture on its use.

Unfortunately people lack common sense, hence the warnings on products, like laundry tablets - keep out of reach of children etc.""",2023-09-20 17:06:37+00:00

(current status in text post)","Today is the day that the currently forming parties break the Dutch record for the longest during formation in our history. Exactly 208 days ago, on 15.03.2017, the Dutch general elections took place. Due to the fragmented nature of the election result and seat distribution, a though coalition formation was expected. Although the coalition talks are officially still in progress, some outlines of the new coalition agreement have already been leaked out.

* The 'low' VAT rate will be increased from 6% to 9%. The Netherlands has three VAT rates: a high VAT rate of 21%, which is also regarded as the 'general' VAT rate. The low VAT rate of 6%, which applies to food, water, medicines, books, and several services, including bicycle repair, getting a haircut, entrance to sporting facilities. The 0% VAT rate only applies in special cases.

* The number of income tax brackets is reduced from 4 to 2. There will be one income tax tarif for those who earn less than €68.000 a year and one for those who earn more than that, respectively 37% and 49,5%. Currently, the income taxes vary between 36,5% and 52%, distributed over 4 brackets.

* Corporate tax will be lowered.

* Mayors will become electable. Currently, mayors are indirectly elected by the king.

* Some specific counter-terrorism measures. One law regarding the allowed time to keep a suspect in custody will be altered, aimed at suspects of terrorism and war crimes in the Syrian civil war.

* Growth of marihuana will be regulated. That means we will finally get government approved weed. :D

* There will be more focus on national history in primary education. It's something that the CDA (christian democrats) had copied from the populist PVV during the election campaign to steal some votes on the right wing, as the PVV had been polling as the largest party. By means of compensation with other coalition parties, history classes should also stress the darker side of our history, including the extensive slave trade during the 16th and 17th century.

* A large budget increase for primary education is expected. Primary school teachers have been protesting against the high working demands they experience. The Netherlands is facing a chronic shortage of teachers in both primary and secondary education. This shortage has only been increasing over the past years.
