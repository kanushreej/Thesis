ukpolitics,post,antisemitic,1cus9rj,Current_Professor_33,"Country’s going to the dogs (aren’t they all) … As an overworked member of the populace, what are the things I can do to help improve the system?","Voting in the local and general election seems pointless (I still do it though) when you’ve got gerrymandering and lobbying groups going on.

Rap/Trap/Drill glorifies violence, hustling on the street, paying your dues and doing bird; police are seemingly powerless to stop the never ending waves of crime washing over the working class, and when people are caught it seems the justice system lacks the teeth to mete out proportionate consequences to fit the crimes (blue and white collars alike). Music in general has no positive message anymore.

The tax system is a joke: The rich have ways to funnel their cash out of the system whilst almost every public service has been privatised for profit and everything else is turning into a subscription service; small businesses get ground up by overheads whilst banks get bailed out and subsidies are handed to corporations; the rich get richer…

We don’t have enough doctors and the NHS is a joke.

All the youth and social programs have been shut down, kids have nothing to do but doomscroll or make unsavoury choices.

I’m very supportive of immigration and supporting asylum seekers, but it would be nice if everyone who comes here gets educated and works; we’ve got long term homeless on the streets and single mums and young families living in abject poverty whilst others come here and get given a massive leg up, it’s unjust to a certain degree.

We don’t make anything anymore, we whore out our lands and industries to foreign investors because everything is built by the cheapest bidder and we’re all so broke that we favour cheap junk that breaks over quality items that last.

We don’t educate our children properly — I grew up in the 80’s/90’s and feel massively let down by the public education system myself, and I think it’s only getting worse — Higher education should be free and available to all (at least the first time around).

I work 12 hour days and get two days off to keep my corner tidy and functional, I do not have time to join a protest in London that will get swept under the carpet by the media and ignored by the public because we’ve got other real personal problems to deal with.

I’m fed up of feeling helpless — What can I do as an individual or as part of a larger group that will have a positive effect on the state of things?

And no, I’m not a Tory, I don’t read the daily mail or listen to Piers Morgan or Nigel Farage, I’m not racist or Islamophobic or an antisemite — Yes, there are some sweeping blanket statements here, and all of them true.

I’m not looking for my words to be picked apart, I don’t have time to defend my opinion, I just want to know what I can do to help make things better in a meaningful and powerful way.
