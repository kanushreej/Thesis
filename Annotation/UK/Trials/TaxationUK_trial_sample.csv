AskUK,post,pension,14gzw8i,Budget-Cow-8256,Is it really a bad idea to opt out of a workplace pension?,"I’m currently paying 6.5%, which amounts to about £135 a month.

I’ll be honest, I know people say it’s a bad idea and to think long-term, but I’m struggling to do so at the minute with the cost of everything rising. I live on my own and things are a bit tight at the minute and that £135 could make a measurable difference to my current life, and so it’s difficult to follow the ‘Yeah, but think about when you’re retired in 40 years time’ train of thought. 

I’m not definitely set on it, because I do obviously see and acknowledge the benefits, but it’s becoming harder to justify. 

Anyone thinking the same?

Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice. I’m going to look into my options and see whether reducing contributions might be possible.",2023-06-23 14:22:51+00:00
