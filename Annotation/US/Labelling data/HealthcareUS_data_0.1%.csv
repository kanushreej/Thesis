What I explained to them is that it's not the idiots who stay home on election day, they think voting works, and it's not the people who understand how the world and government functions through observation and lived experience, they *know* voting works, rather it's the people with **just enough** knowledge of things to rationalize themselves into believing that their vote doesn't matter and can't make a difference who stay home on election day.  Some of them spend a great deal of time, thought, and effort justifying why they should be lazy, complacent, and apathetic.  
  
I'd like to thank you for providing me with an example.  I'll ping you in the comment as credit.

Edit:  My reply from the other comment:  

>It's not the idiots who stay home on election day, it's the people who have just enough knowledge to rationalize themselves into inaction. They know just enough about politics to convince themselves that their vote doesn't matter. They care about things, and perceiving that there's no action on the goals they care about (because that's what Jacobin and Common Dreams and Rose Twitter is telling them) they logically conclude based on that bad information that their vote won't promote any action either.

>Idiots vote in every election, it's like that bell curve meme we see all the time: The idiots vote because they think it matters and their vote can change things, the big brain folks vote because they know it matters and they know their vote can change things, it's the connoisseur crayon eaters in the center of the curve who are smarter than the idiots and dumber than the big brains that manage to convince themselves to stay home.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,aca,dbu5i2b,pyromancer93,,"Difficult to say until we're into his presidency. If Trump is a Reconstructive President, he's a weird one, largely due to his massive levels of unpopularity coming into office, his narrow win EC win, and his popular vote loss(all previous Reconstructive Presidents have crushed the popular vote, the EC vote, or both). Additionally, many of Trump's policies aren't that different from other Republicans, especially regarding taxes, and he seems to be largely outsourcing domestic policy to Pence and Ryan. He does seem to want to reconstruct the US's position globally and take US foreign policy in a more transactional direction, but it's difficult to tell how far he can take that. 

There's also a very good case to be made that Trump is in fact a sign that the Reagan Era has entered it's disjunction phase. Trump has a lot in common with previous disjunctive presidents: he's an outsider, he ran on being able to fix things by himself with a skill set unique to him, he's not trusted in the slightest by his party's establishment, he's got his own group of insular advisors, and his coalition is on very shaky ground in spite of all the post-election back-patting. 

Again, hard to say for sure until he starts to govern. One thing that's absolutely sure is that he's not articulating or preempting Reaganism, so that leaves us with either Reconstruction or Disjunction.

Rates can be tricky, but the only people i see publicly defending the complexity of the current tax code and all its special-interest loopholes are angry redditors who reflexively oppose any Trump initiatives.

Simplifying the tax code and capping exemptions are obvious starting points of agreement for bipartisan tax reform legislation. It's certainty valid to disagree on statutory rates.  But there is consensus the tax code is too complex and the statutory corporate tax rate is too high. Economists on both sides know It's wasteful, inefficient, hurts small businesses and reduces the global competitiveness of brick & mortar US manufacturers while encouraging the offshoring of profits and accounting shell games.  It's ripe to be cut down, and the only thing preventing it is partisanship. 

As for bipartisanship, in theory, the freedom caucus could be overruled. But in practice, because their votes are needed to pass *any* partisan legislation, they can derail compromise bills simply by threatening to vote no on any number of future partisan votes, effectively neutering House GOP leadership.  

They'd probably skip that, and simply murder Paul Ryan right there on the floor, Julius Ceasar-style.

It's an insidious word, one that has been used in the justification of innumerable atrocities throughout history. It dehumanizes, makes enemies and monsters of people who are really not so different from ourselves. In Nazi Germany, citizens who had never bourn ill will towards their neighbors thought of the Jews as “them.” In that same era, the Japanese became “them,” and in our own time, with what has been come to be known as the Culture War, insular groups under the flags of political parties, ideology, social structures, race, and a myriad other banners have identified those who they differ from as “them.”

The language we use is important, and it can tell us a lot about the prevailing zeitgeists that inform so much of how we behave, and perceive those around us. When we boil a complex and unique group of individuals down to a simple, “them,” we justify in our own minds the combative nature with which we engage those who we disagree with.

This has always been the case, through all of recorded human history. The combination of in group preference and conflict for limited resources, or hegemony of a certain way of life has justified the worst things humans have done to each other. Genocide, rape, murder, conquest and torture. In the mind of the perpetrator it's never inflicted upon another human, its done to “them.”

We’re not so much more evolved then people were a thousand years ago, we just have more advanced technology. And even now we’re engaging in the same behavior, dehumanizing our adversaries with whom we likely have much more in common than not. In my own country, the juggernaut of a nation that is the United States, this has manifested itself in recent years in the dominance of hyper-partisan political and social movements. The most obvious schism being between those aligned with the Republican and Democratic parties. To say that these two groups don’t see eye to eye is a laughable understatement. Members of each group have real, observable animus towards those across the aisle, and it's not uncommon at all to see individuals outright denying the humanity of those whose values do not align with their own, or calling for them to be summarily eradicated. True, much of this takes place on social media platforms where toxic dis-inhibition and anonymity allow for people to state the worst of their beliefs without reprisal, but the thoughts are still in peoples heads.

To my reckoning, the growing gap between partisan groups is the greatest threat to the stability of not only my country, but to all of the developed world. If we’re to truly make progress as a species, real, long lasting improvements to the global quality of life and stability of both developed and developing nations, it is imperative that disparate groups be able to work together, if only for the sake of productive stability. We don’t have to like each other, but we do have to be able to get along.

What both those in the Progressive and Conservative camps fail to acknowledge, let alone practice in policy, is that they both need each other. In J.B Peterson’s Beyond Order, he states that,

“A functional social institution - a hierarchy devoted to producing something of value, beyond the mere insurance of its own survival - can utilize the conservative types to carefully implement processes of tried-and-true value, and the creative, liberal types to determine what is old and out of date might be replaced by something new and more valuable. The balance between conservatism and originality might therefore be properly struck, socially, by bringing the two types of person together. But someone must determine how best to do that, and that requires a wisdom that transcends mere temperamental proclivity. Because the traits associated with creativity, on the one hand, and comfort with the status quo, on the other, then to be mutually exclusive, it is difficult to find a single person who has balanced both properly, who is therefore comfortable working with each type, and who can attend, in an unbiased manner, to the necessity for capitalizing on the respective forms of talent and proclivity. But the development of that ability can at least begin with an expansion of conscious wisdom: the articulated realization that conservatism is good ( with a set of associated dangers,) and that creative transformation - even of the radical sort - is also good (with a set of associated dangers.)”

\-Peterson, 34

The complexity inherent to running a developed and productive society as multi-factored as the ones we have created necessitates that there be in employ a range of skills and mental attitudes beyond the scope of a single individual to hold in their minds. We have to work with people unlike us, and whom we disagree with. Everyone has to be willing to concede when we are too entrenched in our old ways, or when our ideas are too radical and transformation of society to be instituted safely and effectively.

The gulf between those with different beliefs has grown treacherously large, with those attempting to bridge the divide being slandered as fence sitters or worse. To demonstrate, imagine a simple scenario: You go to a pub, and order a beer. You sit down next to a stranger, and see that he is wearing a MAGA hat, or perhaps an “I’m with her,” T-shirt. Some of you will immediately see an ally, or an adversary in that individual. You will ascribe a litany of judgements about them, just by learning what political affiliation they express.

Global attributions are counter productive, and rarely useful. If someone’s got a swastika tattooed on their arm, perhaps leaping to a few conclusions may be warranted, but something as banal as what political party or candidate someone supports does not warrant such summary judgements. Political expression should not be a radical act, it should be at most, a point of polite discussion.

But it is not. Adversarial groups do not want to coexist, or find functional middle ground, they want to win. This is a childish mindset, and is antithetical to the stability of our country. We need everyone, or at least a critical mass of people, on board with a single agenda to make anything happen, even if there isn’t the slightest bit of agreement on how to reach that end. By marginalizing any group based either on their beliefs, or immutable characteristics, we simply contribute to the instability of society at large.

To this end, I think the two greatest contributing factors are the legacy media, and Social media platforms. The former leans into hyper-partisan reporting, (this occurs on both sides of the aisle, and pretty much everyone in the news media is guilty of it to varying degrees) and uses inflammatory reporting to boost their own ratings, even if it drives a wedge through the middle of American society and is highly unproductive. The latter, and in my opinion the more egregious of the two is social media.

With so much of our communication and life being curated by an algorithm designed to please us and keep us coming back for more (fuck you Mark,) we’re truncated into small boxes, where we’re not challenged, or exposed to radically different opinions or ways of viewing the world.

After being locked in these echo chambers for so long, particularly during the last two years of imposed isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic, we simply can’t fathom how people can believe things so fundamentally disparate from what we do. But these people are not so dissimilar from us, they’re just in different digital worlds, and they’re mostly inherently good.

If one is to give humanity the benefit of the doubt in regards to the inherent goodness of people, then we should be able to understand that nearly everyone wants fundamentally the same thing; peace, a life free of hostility, and improvements in quality of life for as many people as possible. To deny this to those who simply fall on the wrong side of no man’s land in the war that has become hyper-partisan politics is to dehumanize our fellow man in a fashion in line with the portrayal of Jews in Germany, native Americans in the early years of the American colonies, or to this very day gays in many middle eastern countries. And I fear that such dehumanization will have similar results.

There are, of course, bad faith actors and evil people on both sides of every issue, but they are vastly outnumbered, and to attribute their motives to any movement at large that they have embedded themselves in is counter-productive and intellectually dishonest.

This isn’t to lay blame on anyone, like I said, almost everyone is doing what they believe is the right thing.

But people are afraid. The world is changing, and not for the better. The challenges we face will only continue to become more severe, and the primitive reptile part of our brains wants to fall back on tribalism and violence to ensure our survival. This will not work.

We’ve created an incomprehensibly complex world, with a myriad of serious problems. If we’re to address and fix its problems, we’re going to have to break bread with people we’ve seen as enemies. Violence and conflict will not solve our problems. Communication, concession and compromise, mutual trust, and belief in the inherent goodness of our fellow man will.

If you’ve made it this far, I beseech you, find common ground with those whom you think you have none. You’ll be made a more intelligent and functional member of society because of it, and you’ll be contributing to the solution, not the problem.

Nearly everyone believes they’re doing the right thing, and generally they want the best for everyone, even those they say they hate. Though they might never let go of their anger and fear enough to admit it to themselves, let alone the world at large. It's hard to say you’re wrong.

Everyone wants to be happy,

We’re all alone,

None of us asked to be here.

So lets grit our teeth, shake hands with those we want to spit on, and try to actually fix this dumpster fire of a planet enough to one day leave it and take our rightful place among the stars.

As for the story you told me, It is heartbreaking to hear this and, in some cases, abortion could be the best option, however some cases is not most cases.
For abortions, doctors go into the woman's womb and rip the baby limb by limb. Each baby part has to be accounted for or else the mother can get sick. This is not the baby not being able to survive outside the body. The doctor is clearly affecting and killing this baby.

Fetuses are people. If you are classifying ""people"" off of looks, well that is exactly how people look at that age. That is exactly how you looked at that age. If you are classifying ""people"" off of cells, then we are all made up of cells. You are made up of cells. That fetus, if left alone, would've become a child, and a person. Abortions are actively preventing that fetus from growing up, and living a life. Thus, it is killing a life. Now that child may have a rough life as an unplanned pregnancy, but that is no excuse for killing it. It is not our choice to choose whether or not to prevent a life. No matter what that life may be, it is the fetus' right to live that life.

You talk of abortion as the only solution, but abortion is an excuse to take away the consequence of sex. We need to know that when you have unprotected sex, you are creating life. Life that cannot be simply aborted. Life has more meaning than that. I'm sorry if it is an inconvience, but it is less an inconvenience to just put on a condom.",2022-06-26T06:40:35+00:00

>The 2017 tax bill cut the revenue that would be collected by the government by 2 trillion dollars.

I'm 100% sure that's not correct.  That's a high end estimate spread out over 10 years.

Also, maybe Detroit and Baltimore are waning in influence, that's the way of the world. Jobs and Growth go to environments most conducive to expansion.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,deductible,c6idx3m,UptownDonkey,,"As I understand it Romney supports broadening the base. One of the big problems with our current tax code is two people with the same income can pay very different amount of taxes. It all depends which deductions they take and exactly how they earn income. When you broaden the base you *have* to increase taxes on someone. For example let's say you had 3 tax payers all with the same income. A pays $15k, B pays $12K, C pays $5K. To broaden the base and stay revenue neutral the goal would be for A, B and C to pay $10.6k each. So you could lower rates and most tax payers would pay less but some have to pay more. Romney also wants to reduce the number of tax brackets which makes the tax code less progressive. Simply meaning more people will pay the same rate. If you make $50k a year you might pay the same percentage in taxes as someone making $500k a year instead of, in the current system, the person making $500k/year paying a higher rate. He calls it revenue neutral under the assumption that the tax cuts will create more jobs. More people will pay more taxes. 

My opinion is broadening the base is the obvious way to do tax reform. The code is too complex, unfair and prone to abuse by both tax payers and legislators. I have problems with the Romney plan though. First he doesn't offer enough specifics or consistency. He has gone on the record saying he would eliminate some deductions, cap deductions at $20k, or cap deductions at $50k. So this has huge ramifications on a lot of middle class tax payers. He won't tell me if he's going to lower my taxes, keep them the same, or increase them. Second problem is he makes the tax code less progressive. I don't think I should pay the same rate as someone making $500k/year. Third problem is we have a huge deficit and debt yet he won't increase revenues. Again since he's short on details we don't know exactly how much economic growth he needs for his tax plan to even be revenue neutral. So it could either keep the deficit/debt the same or massively increase it. Unless you have a time machine no way can say for sure. It's a theory. Didn't work when Bush tried it. Worked when Reagan did it but in large part because rates at the high end *were* extremely high at the time and his tax cuts had a dramatic impact. Rates, especially for the wealthy, are already so low there's just less to gain cutting their taxes further. Forth problem is Romney's tax plan requires huge spending cuts to balance the budget. So he needs to win and get a Republican congress for 8 years to ensure those spending cuts happen. That's a total fantasy. Tax reform could pass but there's no way the spending cuts ever happen or at least not to the degree Romney needs for his math to work. So basically his plan is built on a sound idea but augmented with smoke, mirrors, ideology and assumptions.

The President's plan is, more or less, keep things the same but have the rich pay more. This doesn't really solve a lot of problems either but in my opinion is a better choice because at least you know what you're getting. It's a safe plan.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,deductible,clk1ezw,r_a_g_s,,"> The most important concept that is completely misunderstood (besides the tax brackets point I made above) is how capital gains works. High income earners and those in certain professions take heavy advantage of capital gains discounts and I think if more common folk actually knew the extent of this it would change how many people think about fairness in taxation.

This.  It's why Warren Buffett pays a smaller percentage of his income as income tax than his secretary does.  If you manage to keep all your stocks for at least a year, then the income you get from them via capital gains and/or dividends is taxed at a maximum rate of **20%**.  But if you're, say, a doctor or lawyer with a big ""salary"" income, your top marginal tax rate is **39.6%**.  Why the **hell** is Mitt Romney paying a lower tax rate than someone who actually works for a living?",2014-10-26T07:42:09+00:00

Can't do this on health insurance policies because the repairs aren't counted towards insuring the individual item (person).

We have people that use insurance for every little thing - be that the person and their healthcare or their home, rental or auto. On those other types of insurance, their use ups their premium on healthcare it doesn't seem to matter.

Could we, including provider, use more of a catastrophic coverage to keep premiums lower? Would the price of these more minor item come down? They should.

Neoliberal,comment,disability,eide09w,Iron-Fist,,"So the answer to this is pretty simple and has been enacted successfully in many places.

The labor of low skill people in high skill, high cost of living countries cannot provide a basic living on the open market. However, their labor is not worthless, it just isnt rare or productive enough to earn a livable wage. This is addressed by Active Labor Market Policy. Active Labor Market Policies like activation subsidies or direct employment subsidies (like EITC) are basic, but things like subsidies for volunteer services or even direct government job creation or placement get economically valuable productivity that a living wage level UBI simply hasnt been shown to do.

On another note, I dislike the negative light OP puts on the disabled, like there is a serious issue with faking or swindling that system. There isnt. People who are disabled are just that, disabled, and have ample evidence to prove their inability to work. It is extremely difficult to get disability in the US; for example missing 1 hand or leg doesn't qualify, you need be missing 2 legs.

Politics,comment,disability,isq1fko,nerdyspeechie,,"I'm a little late to the party here, but I couldn't help but share my thoughts. It seems like there are a couple of people taking the definition of a stroke at face value without even trying to understand that it's more complex than simply stroke = brain damage = cognitive impairment. A stroke is the stoppage of blood flow to the brain, that's it. In 9/10 cases this will cause some degree of damage, but damage does *not* equal impairment. If the person reacts quickly and is able to restore the blood flow, the chances of them having long-term deficits go way down. Other things that impact the severity of the stroke and, therefore, the chance of long-term deficits include what type of stroke (ischemic vs. hemorrhagic), how large the stroke was, whether there is evidence of a mid-line shift, and where the stroke occurs. I'm a speech-language pathologist in both inpatient rehabilitation and acute care settings, so my caseload is primarily filled with people that have had a stroke. You'd be amazed by the number of evaluations I've done where I did not pick up a person for services because they did not have any cognitive impairments following a stroke. But not having this understanding is only a small part of the issue at hand. Simply focusing on the fact that he had a stroke and making statements like ""not your typical candidate interview"" for needing closed captions is ableist AF, whether that is the intention or not. There is absolutely no need to call his mental capacity into question just because he had a stroke. If he was cleared by a psychologist and/or speech-language pathologist as having no cognitive impairments, then that's it. Case closed. And if he did have some residual deficits that are easily overcome with a couple of extra supports in place, then so what? As long as his policies are ones that I agree with, I'll gladly take that candidate over someone who gives medical advice based on pseudoscience and peddles misinformation.",2022-10-17T21:08:43+00:00

Libertarian,comment,doctor,h5mkaj3,Typhus_black,,"There is no such thing as an “infinite amount of providers”.  There is only so much time and resources to train people. There are only so many cases of appendicitis that come into a hospital every year as an example of a limited resource. When a educational hospital knows they will average X number of cases of appendicitis a year that tells them roughly how many people they can train on surgical management of appendicitis. If you show up to a hospital how many surgeries to remove an inflamed appendix would you want your surgeon to have done before they do yours?

There will always be a wait time for things that are not acute or life threatening emergencies. If you need a cardiologist no matter how free the market is there are still only so many cardiologists available because there are only ever a certain number of patients who need a cardiologist. If a city has enough patients that they need 2 cardiologists then that is how many will last there. It’s not like a third is just going to move from another city and set up a clinic. They’re going to find out beforehand how many patients they can expect to have. If there aren’t enough, no one is opening a new clinic and no hospital or existing group will higher another physician. 

Even if a new group does move in and starts a price war and they win out over the existing group what happens to the existing groups patients? They are now forced to change their physician to the new group. What stops the new group from raising their prices now that they are the last man standing? There’s a huge amount of money and resources that goes into having a medical practice, even a simple general practitioners office has huge up front costs for equipment and space that must be paid before they even open their door and see a single patient. A hospital is even more resource intensive. All of this means a new competitor moving in is difficult. Even if you remove legal and regulatory burdens a new MRI machine stills costs money, X number of blood pressure machines, medical waste disposal, computer systems, EMR, personnel. 

If you’re the new group you have to come in and provide what the current one does in order to compete. You are also now trying to take patients from that existing group. There is more that goes into a physician patient relationship than just money or cost. If it means saving you 10$ on your visit but you are switching away from Dr. McCoy who did your life saving heart surgery 3 years ago and has been working with you since are you really pinching that many pennies?

Modern health care will not improve with a purely free market solution. It is quite literally impossible for the consumer to be informed on what they actually need before they have been evaluated.

Representative democracy has some failure modes, like the possibility voters won't know what laws do. On the whole, assuming institutions work right, this possibility can be minimized or outweighed by the tendency of voters to self-correct. 

Currently, many of our institutions exacerbate intrinsic problems with representative democracy. Gerrymanders & the geographic apportionment of the Senate, make it difficult for voters to know how their vote changes or doesn't change law. This is then further muddied by FOX News, partisanship etc. 

By default, a minority of voters can control a majority of Senators. While the filibuster allows a very small minority to stop a hard-won majority in the counter-majoritarian Senate, it also allows the majority of the country from being completely dominated by a minority. Ideally, the Senate itself should be rethought and gerrymanders would be ended/minimized.

Okay, I see your point, but I'm not sure how the numbers matter. We should care about the quality of treatment of anyone, even if there are only a few of them. That's all I was asking about...that and why it's so hard to discuss. I would think the right-wing talking point would be: ""Trans people don't exist, surgery is mutilation, everyone who disagrees is a commie libtard pedophile."" Or other hateful words to that effect. That said, if questioning the quality of trans medical care is also a right wing thing, then I could see how that could be triggering.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,doctor,d1jtnie,BlindPelican,,">How is this against the argument , i dont understand it.

Well, first you have to understand where and how the argument came to be. Abortion has never been illegal. All attempts to intercede in it were, at least at first, designed specifically with the health of the woman in mind (bear in mind, we are talking about late 19th century pre-antibiotic days and it was an *actual* problem). 

Abortion wasn't really a huge political issue even during the early 70's before or after the Roe decision (which was heard on the basis of laws which restricted medical professionals and not women). In order to ensure that women could still have adequate access to safe abortions, the ""right to privacy"" was used as an out to sidestep what would have been a clear legal, yet murky moral, issue.

So, fast-forward to the Reagan administration. While trying to court the Religious southern democrats, abortion was introduced as a wedge issue. Is was sure to spark backlash from feminists (which had already aligned to the left) and appealed to the moral sensibilities of Evangelicals (even though many didn't care or even supported abortion 2 decades before).

So, the whole campaign of ""abortion = murder"", ""it's a child, not a choice"", etc. was designed explicitly to appeal to a voting block that considered themselves (at the time) to be the advocates for the helpless. It didn't have any political teeth, of course, as the issue was more than settled both by case law and the Roe decision.

So, the battle raged on, even though Republicans didn't have a snowball's chance in hell of doing anything particularly egregious to a woman's right to choose...until the Casey decision...

Fast forward to the early Clinton administration. Under the Casey decision, you now had this little snippet of awfulness (thanks to Scalia). 

>*the court upheld...*the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child

So, now the door is open to allow for restrictive laws to be put in place as long as they don't place ""undue burden"" on a woman seeking an abortion.

So, fast forward to today. To date, there has not been a serious push to make all abortions illegal. The rhetoric still flies around (""abortion is murder"", etc.) but no Republican will touch the idea. They will push to shorten the legal term for an abortion, Republican activists will force a woman to be ~~humiliated~~ urged by hordes of shouting onlookers protesting at clinics, they will put ridiculous requirements on doctors, but they absolutely will not try to make it illegal.

As to why they wouldn't...[it would be political suicide for one, as very few think it should be completely illegal](http://www.gallup.com/poll/170249/split-abortion-pro-choice-pro-life.aspx) and two - decades of cultivation of the Religious right would fall apart as the battle would be won and they would be open to incursion from the Democrats who could appeal to their charitable nature over other issues - poverty, homelessness, etc.

Anyway, that's a very long way of saying...conservatives don't make the argument that abortion should be illegal.

There are of course multiple political dimensions to this crisis. Politics shapes what actions to mitigate the crisis are considered acceptable and what should and should not be prioritised. Whilst the scale of the crisis is so great that it is one of the rare events capable of actually changing people’s world views and reassessing their own priorities. 

Given this, why do people get so annoyed about talking about it as a political issue? The amount of pain it has caused (death, long term illness, unemployment, loneliness, lack of physical contact). During the heat of a crisis, people generally don’t want to acknowledge politics. This crisis has burned hot for an unusually protracted period, and it has become debate stifling.

This dynamic is visible internationally. In the U.K. the right-wing government has shut down nearly all parliamentary dissent and resisted calls for an inquiry. The opposition have caved completely and decided not to even bother offering a competing path forward (focus groups have told them this would not be popular).

Neoliberal,comment,doctors,kanaan8,GOT_Wyvern,,"How would utility be promoted by everyone ignoring their own utility? You have been able to discern why this isn't the case, and utilitarian expects (not only because it is intuitive) people to be able to as well. It can be argued that part of your argument is based on utility, specially the argument that it would result in ""the total destruction of human beings"".

I would certainly argue that such is a clear promotion of aggregate disutility, therefore such consequences should be avoided under a utilitarian moral theory. Why should we avoid ""the total destruction of human beings"" if not for the reason that is prevents happiness?

The only way people could justifying sacrificing themselves for aggregate utility is if they are blind to this motive being possible amongst everyone else, but as most people are not blind in such a way, it becomes clear that doing such would not promote aggregate utility.

You cannot rationally promote utility through actions that would knowingly result in disutility. J.S Mill, for example, specifically notes that people are very good at understanding when such would result in your ""horror shows"", both with their intuition and the rationalisation of their intuition.

Your criticism, like many tend to be of utilitarianism, seems to rely on the assumption that people would make their choices in a vacuums, without consideration of the choices of others or consequences directly beyond the situation. In your example, that vacuum is the blindness to everyone else having the same notions of self-sacrifice.

But this is simply not what utilitarianism argues for. Rather, it argues for people to make considerations based off situations in their entirety (or at least within human fallibility). In your example, this would be considering the case that such self-sacrifice - when executed by everyone - would only result in aggregate disutility.

For your examples of Western Society and Africa (I will be referring to what I think you mean in terms of development), the simple rebuttal on utilitarian grounds is that developed nations could not promote utility in undeveloped nations without first the economic prosperity to afford such over a sufficiently long period of time. What good would be bankrupting developed nations if it would mean they could no longer promote utility in undeveloped nations?

If developed nations were to bankrupt themselves to promote utility in undeveloped nations, they could not continue to promote utility overtime. The alternative of providing sustainable (for the developed nations) utility would be the choice that results in greater aggregate utility. It is this short of rationalisation of the consequences of actions - rather than relying on motivations for such - that is at the core of utilitarianism.

In terms of egoism, the presentation of it ignores the fact that if you rationally promote aggregate utility - even at a modest individual cost - the same promotion from others will impact you and likely more so than you could have promoted your own utility.

However, there is also the fact that such egoism doesn't run completely contrary to utilitarianism. An important argument in the theory is that when people are making decisions, it is usually in the best interests of aggregate utility to rely upon rationally-applied intuition and a degree of self-interested.

This is simply due to the arguments that intuition is both shaped by what promotes utility in the first place, and that a degree of self-interest is the rational way for people to effectively promote utility; you know the impact of utility in circumstances of self-interest more than random altruism. Nevertheless, for the reason mentioned before, there is still a rational place for altruism.",2023-11-25T02:30:01+00:00

Under Wisconsin statutes that say anyone under 18 who ""goes armed"" with any deadly weapon is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor, Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, was not old enough to legally carry the assault-style rifle he had.

But John Monroe, a lawyer who specializes in gun rights cases, believes an exception for rifles and shotguns, intended to allow people age 16 and 17 to hunt, could apply.

Tom Grieve, a Milwaukee defense lawyer who also specializes in gun cases, agreed the exception might apply beyond hunting, but said that part of the law is poorly drafted. He said he would argue to apply a rule of law that interprets ambiguous criminal statutes in favor of the defendant.

Rittenhouse could be in violation of having a gun within a gun-free zone, if there was one covering, for instance, a school nearby. Also, Illinois law requires anyone who owns any kind of firearm in that state to have a Firearm Owners Identification card, but that is only available to someone 21 or older, or someone with a sponsor who is 21 and eligible for a card.”

If we can also agree that impeachment won’t remove him as long as the GOP still remains complicit, then the impeachment’s only purpose is to send a message and the first opportunity to remove him will be the same as if he wasn’t impeached, the 2020 elections.

Dems are trying to prove collusion, but Trump is trying to convince people it’s a witch hunt. 

It’s possible an impeachment that fails to remove him from office, as well as one done on the basis of a report that we don’t know the contents of yet     could end up in later analysis as being premature.

There is plenty of risk to the Dems in the next election cycle if it backfires, and likely very little damage to Trump if it doesn’t.

Ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Federal law prevents hunters from hunting migratory game birds with more than three shells in their shotgun. That means our federal law does more to protect ducks than children. It’s wrong. Joe Biden will enact legislation to once again ban assault weapons. This time, the bans will be designed based on lessons learned from the 1994 bans. For example, the ban on assault weapons will be designed to prevent manufacturers from circumventing the law by making minor changes that don’t limit the weapon’s lethality. While working to pass this legislation, Biden will also use his executive authority to ban the importation of assault weapons.

However, before I could obtain the medication, my insurance changed to Cigna.

Liberal,comment,expensive,c7j40dv,lordtyp0,,"Lot of points-will try and touch on them. I will use a numerical count for Paragraphs 1-6 for ease of response:

1: I agree on the Assault weapons part. Struck me as grandstanding to make a base happy.

2: This is a bit complicated and a lot of different points made each with its own subset of issues. I disagree that regulations and the EPA should go away. Simple fact is Business exists to enrich itself. It is not benevolent or it would be an NPO. Likewise-Capitalism is a form of governance and not simply an economic term. In Capitalism-the inner workings are optimally left to private enterprise but the government exists to constrain corporate activity. To ensure they do not become parasitical in nature be it abusive in some manner or monopolistic. Many of the issues that have come about recently are because of badly enacted regulation-regulations with loopholes that allowed abuse and constraints in things that would have been somewhat healthy. I think we both agree that regulations need an overhaul but I think we differ on how is all. For the EPA: It is easy to find examples where had there been enforced regulation on items-disaster would not occur. From true horrors like the Bhopal disaster (referenced as an example of industrial accident due to taking shortcuts-Bhopal is not in the US of course. But the same shortcuts occur here) to countless cases of destroyed environments-water table in Montana as another example-as it currently stands it is drastically cheaper to pay a fine than to adhere to safe and healthy practices. The EPA is impotent to do much about it because it only has powers it is given by the Fed which is basically only cursory and for show.

3: The only issue I see with that is there needs to be a binding framework of agreements for them to operate (re Fed). The argument can be made-rightly so in many places that the Fed has too much power. But-by dissolving central power it invites the formation of city states. Extreme differences could arise between them and it could be a nightmare of people running back and forth across borders or things that are truly bad. So, I like the idea, I just can't see how it could be practically enacted.

4: Def agree on the TSA. Disagree on EPA for reasons stated. Im ambivalent on FCC. I understand the reason for assignment. Tech can't work if everyones flooding a frequency.

5: Indefinite Incarceration was part of the Patriot Act. The Obama NDAA refined certain points and actually removed a couple points of abuse-it is still an ugly act that needs work. Lot of people want gun control laws. Couldn't care less about someones stance on video game violence. Ignorance is a common currency :P

6: Its not a quote. It was his policies. And no, he wasn't a great leader. When he was in office he was regarded as mediocre. He was deified after he passed. The case could actually be made with a good degree of technical evidence that he got into office via Treason (working the deal with Iran to release the hostages before elected in-released the day he got into office.).

His trickle down economics were also destructive-case in point the tax rates from WW2 (enacted by the last good Republican President-Eisenhower) fluctuated between 70 and 91% on the wealthy. That period is regarded as the golden age by a LOT of people-had tremendous growth and prosperity. It obviously had issues too from wars to civil unrest. Point being-he was a sell out. After the religious right was married into the Republican party and big business started bankrolling them is when things started really going down hill in the US. Reagan helped usher that era in.

For HIV/AIDS specifically:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_policy_of_the_Ronald_Reagan_administration#Response_to_AIDS

His quote says specifically that he wont condone rights to the GLBT community of any sort-This was the era where couples could not visit each other in the hospitals. I am not talking anything like marriage here. Just basic dignities.

Libertarian,comment,expensive,kzkqijh,codifier,,"It's a giant shit sandwich, and a lot of it comes from over-regulation and coziness of corporations help write those regulations but I will state a lot of people have no fucking idea how private insurance works.  I can rack up 300k in medical bills in a year, and most I pay is $10k total, it's called max out of pocket, I can have a massive health problem and I am not going to walk out with a giant bill.  There's a lot of gotchas, such as staying in network but most big networks like CHI are everywhere and on about every network, you just have to pay attention to how your plan works and every place I have hung my shingle has been prolific in helping people understand it.  Many plans allow you to put money away tax free into an account to pay your Healthcare costs; not enough in my opinion but usually enough to cover at least your deductible and a chunk of your max out of pocket.  

The poor have healthcare too, kinda.  It's generally called Medicare/Medicaid (medicaid is a weird per state/federal program) and applies to retired/disabled in the former case and the indigent in the latter.  The government essentially pays for their healthcare costs at whatever rate the government decides and is quasi-socialized Healthcare.  The problem is that there is no limit or penalties if you're on Medicaid.  Your kid has an earache? Go to the Emergency Room, which is expensive as it's designed to deal with... emergencies, but what do you care you're not paying for it.   Want to go to the emergency room every day?  No one can stop you.  Want special, expensive tests?  Just badger doctors and shop around until you find one that will do it.  And when the bill to the government comes?  The government pays hardly shit, so all those expenses get passed on to private pay because medical staff need paid too.  

Wife worked at a major hospital.  Most people who were staying there were on medicaid.  Homeless would come into the ER, say they have chest pains knowing they would be admitted, and they could treat med/surg floors like a hotel and try to wheedle narcotics.  Many others would show up as OD, get the full ER treatment with one or more expensive narcotics shots, then be released or admitted to do it again.  Wife worked at small clinics, similar problems, someone with medicaid can make an appointment every week if they want and the clinic gets paid maybe 10%, which means they have to pass the cost on to people on private pay, who by the way are already funding medicaid.  This is why socialized healthcare sucks, it treats a valuable commodity as unlimited, and someone eventually has to pay.    Private pay like myself have an incentive to not be wasteful, I don't go to an expensive resource for an earache because there's a cost I must weigh, if it's bad enough it's worth the expense, if it's free there's no incentive time to not overuse it.

This is only scratching the surface, but we do have some socialized medicine, and it's part of why medicine is so expensive, there's tons of other reasons, but the fact we have a growing segment of the population that has a virtually unlimited tab that somehow must be paid is a good part of it.  Don't get me started on how insurance companies are effectively cartels and write the laws for the government, someone else can run that.",2024-04-14T19:32:10+00:00

You have to have massive batteries to store excess energy where with nuclear you can just turn down the output levels. The solar panels last 20 years before they are trashed. Some of the elements in solar panels are toxic so it’s best to be kept in the ground, when it’s trashed it most likely goes to a third world country scrap yard with unregulated safety standards.

The GOP always said training is the key to curbing gun violence, these suggestions put that idea to the test.

1. Mandatory gun training for every student beginning in Pre-K through 12th.

- Pre-school would focus on gun safety, gun are not toys, every gun is loaded, if you see a gun tell an adult, etc… Second Amendment memorized 
- Middle would still be very heavy on gun safety, but safe gun handling would be introduced by trained experts (Army, Marine, Guard). Gun wound first aid will be introduced. Second Amendment discuss.
- High-school would still be about gun safety, gun handling, and gun care. Under strict supervision, students will regularly fire handguns, shotguns, and rifles. Gun wound first aid will be reinforced through simulated practice. Second Amendment studied and debated. 

By the end of this, you will have an entire generation of Americans trained and educated about guns.

2. Allow citizens to complete the paperwork necessary to own guns as part of their drivers license process

3. Encourage Americans to own guns through a stimulus payment

4. Repeal open carry laws

5. Provide resources for establishing community militias 

This basically arms and organizes  minorities, which should m gun nuts more open to:

6. Make no knock warrants completely illegal in the name of officer safety

7. Require every gun owner attend an annual refresher of their senior year training.

8.Require criminal background checks

9. Law Enforcement cannot carry, use, or modify any weapon not available to the general public

10. All guns will be classed as civilian or military use, law enforcement will only be able to use civilian classed weapons.

11. Gun owners must complete a mental health survey annually, and a mental health screening every 5-years until the age of 65, from that point forward the screening is annual

Government officials have [recorded ](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)nearly 35,000 cases and 3,000 deaths from Covid-19, although these are almost certainly massive undercounts. [For example](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/world/americas/ecuador-deaths-coronavirus.html), excess mortality in Guayaquil, the city suffering the most from Covid-19, is eight times regular levels.

Ecuador last made the news when in October of 2019 massive protests against the governments decision to eliminate petroleum subsidies forced the government to temporarily abandon the capital Quito, and eventually reinstate the subsidies. The public health and economic crises in Ecuador are closely intertwined, as economic distress has made it difficult for Ecuador to react aggressively to Covid-19 while the pandemic is devastating the countries economy with the economy [expected ](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/33555/9781464815706.pdf)to [contract by 6%](https://www.focus-economics.com/regions/latin-america) in 2020. In today's podcast episode, I will be discussing the macroeconomic crises on the late 1990s that caused hyperinflation and forced Ecuador to abandon its own currency. In part two, I will discuss the effects Rafael Correa's massive expansion of the state, and the pressures that forced his successor Lenin Moreno to radically change course. Finally, I will discuss how Ecuador's Covid-19 response has been hurt by its economic challenges, and how Covid-19 threatens to create an economic crisis to Ecuador.

Ecuador suffered from a string of spectacular bad luck during the late 1990s. Ecuador [suffered ](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b937/90996a3cf4f8e36b0402859926ddb412c054.pdf)the worst El Nino in its history in 1997-1998, destroying $112 million of crops, nearly 1% of GDP lost, and diseases such as malaria and dengue killing thousands. A series of economic crises hit Russia, Indonesia, Brazil and other nations throughout the developing world caused the price of oil, Ecuador's primary export, to plunge [to under](https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart) to the [lowest ](https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart)inflation adjusted levels in modern history and for investors to start pulling money out of risky emerging markets such as Ecuador. At the same time Ecuador suffered political crisis of its own, with the president, [accused ](http://www.ipsnews.net/1996/10/ecuador-president-bucaram-a-madman-who-loves-and-sings/)of being insane by Congress, impeached from power. By 1998, Ecuador's banks were in default, and the government trying staunch spiraling budget deficits by printing money Inflation soared in Ecuador, [peaking ](https://tradingeconomics.com/ecuador/inflation-cpi)at 108% in 2000, and the economy contracted by 4.7% in 2009. Controlling inflation is first and foremost about expectations. The economy of Ecuador suffered three episodes of hyperinflation between 1980 and 2000, with inflation consistently above 20% a year. Inflation can only be tamed when ordinary people and investors are convinced that a government will not print money to finance budget deficits. Ecuador felt the only way it could accomplish this was to jettison its currency, the Sucre, and replace it with the US Dollar. Making the dollar the currency of Ecuador meant that the central bank no longer had the option to print money, or manipulate the value of its currency for political purposes. While this makes it irresponsible monetary and fiscal policy impossible, it also takes authority and flexibility from Ecuadoran policy makers.

Rafael Correa served as president of Ecuador for three terms between 2007 and 2017. During the [first ](https://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProductCountry_TS.aspx?nvpm=1%7c218%7c%7c%7c%7c%7c66651%7c%7c2%7c1%7c1%7c2%7c2%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c1)seven years of Correa's administration, oil revenues increased from $7.7 billion to $14.5 billion. Rafael Correa was determined toredistributed this new found wealth through the public sector to the broader populace. The government [doubled spending](https://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/ecuador-2017-02.pdf) on healthcare and education, and tripled spending on higher education, and increased public investment 3.5 fold. Ecuador financed this increased spending by [squeezing](https://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/101279/ecuadors_correa_threatens_private_oil_companies_with_eviction/) multinational corporations drilling Ecuador's oil, [repudiating ](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2008/12/12/50403/sign-of-the-times-ecuador-defaults-on-bond-payment/)the country's old debt, and borrowing [massive ](https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-ecuador-loans-china-20181210-story.html)amounts of money at high interest rates from China. Debt that seemed sustainable when the price of oil was high no longer seemed sustainable when oil prices collapsed in 2015. Moreover, heavy government spending led to higher wages, [currency appreciation](https://books.google.com/books?id=h9iuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=correa+overvalued+currency&source=bl&ots=nP9NuWEel9&sig=ACfU3U2e4utfNdy1VqDTRMntCrF0L53afA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj6hsfz6sXpAhWVZDUKHQ7qA2kQ6AEwDHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=correa%20overvalued%20currency&f=false) and a [burgeoning trade deficit](https://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProductCountry_TS.aspx?nvpm=1%7c218%7c%7c%7c%7c%7c66651%7c%7c2%7c1%7c1%7c2%7c2%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c1) that led to foreign exchange outflows. If a country without its own monetary policy runs a large trade deficit cannot find investors, the only way its economy can continue is to suffer an [internal devaluation](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/2495/economics/internal-devaluation-definition/), a painful process of reducing wages to make the economy through deflation, austerity and rising unemployment.

Rafel Correa's succesor, Lenin Moreno, faced precisely that problem and followed an IMF inspired austerity program. It is difficult to disentangle the unavoidable consequences of the macroeconomic situation Moreno inherited from the specific policy choices made by his government. Rafael Correa recognized the inconsistencies of his economic program, and desired to de-dollarize the economy, but the low inflation dollarization assured was too popular to limit. Lenin Moreno's approval rating plummeted for 82% to 32% as he imposed harsh austerity measures. After seeing Argentina's [slow and steady](https://www.newcapitalfunds.com/Portals/0/Literature/Research/Infocus_High_Price_Austerity_Argentina.pdf) approach to austerity fall apart, Moreno decided to eliminate $1.3 billion of fuel subsidies to gain a $4.2 billion loan from the IMF. In [fairness ](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/14/770104729/ecuador-reaches-fuel-subsidy-deal-to-end-violent-protests)to Moreno and the IMF, fuel subsidies are difficult to defend on policy grounds. They are environmentally destructive, regressive and crowd out spending on health and education. Moreover, [targeted ](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02e6Pq5hCQ_Tebi2wPSVYS1xXuuEA%3A1590096798366&ei=nvPGXtD0FavCytMPo9m-iAU&q=moreno+cash+transfer+fuel+subsidies&oq=moreno+cash+transfer+fuel+subsidies&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCCEQoAE6BAgAEEc6CggAEIMBEBQQhwI6AggAOgcIABAUEIcCOgQIABAKOgYIABAWEB46CAgAEBYQChAeOgUIIRCrAjoHCCEQChCgAToICCEQFhAdEB5Qn_QWWIOmF2ClpxdoAXACeACAAaICiAGhIZIBBjcuMTYuNpgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXo&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjQu8yW9MXpAhUroXIEHaOsD1EQ4dUDCAw&uact=5)cash transfer programs were to implemented to cushion the poor from the harm of subsidy cuts. The public did not trust Moreno when he said these policies were necessary, and rose up in massive revolt agaisnt Moreno's administration. Moreno was forced to rescind subsidy cuts, but the underlying macroeconomic problems remained the same.

The government of Ecuador, when Covid 19 first hit the country, was reluctant to impose restrictions at first, because of fears it might [tip ](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2020/04/11/latin-americas-health-systems-brace-for-a-battering)the shaky economy into recession. Although the government has imposed strict measures to contain Covid-19, the delay in implementing these measures gave the Coronavirus time to take root in Ecuador. The government on one hand has seen revenues plummet because of a collapse in global oil prices and paralyzing lockdown measures. The government of Ecuador does not have the option to run a budget deficit to finance the response to Covid-19. Its [medical system](https://reliefweb.int/report/ecuador/unicef-ecuador-humanitarian-response-covid-19-16-april-2020) is struggling to purchase PPE and ventilators. The government has managed a $60 payment to workers earning [less ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/world/americas/ecuador-coronavirus.html)than $400 a month, but its relief efforts have been much more limited than those of other developing nations. The worst case scenario for Ecuador is that the collapse in exports market will cause its $2 billion surplus to become a large deficit. Combined with the collapse of global financial outflows, the result will be internal devaluation. Ecuador was already suffering from deflation in the last months of 2019, could see a full blown balance of payments crisis similar to what Greece suffered in 2008. The government has taken [some steps](https://news.yahoo.com/ecuador-close-embassies-state-firms-over-virus-crisis-150619905.html) to give it more fiscal breathing room. It is closing down embassies and selling off the loss making government airlines. Moreover, the IMF and [other creditors](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/wall-street-hopes-more-time-to-pay-can-save-ecuador-from-default) have eased lending terms, and the IMF is offering [$643 million](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/05/01/pr-20203-ecuador-imf-executive-board-approves-us-643-million-in-emergency-assistance) in assistance with more on offer as needed. International cooperation and strong leadership should stave off the worst financial outcomes, and allow Ecuador to effectively fight Covid-19, but current efforts are not enough to get the job done.

The difference is Massachusetts has policies that make sure that mentally unstable people don't get guns. A big argument against this system is that bad guys will get their hands on guns some other way. What a lot of people don't realize however is that a large portion of mass shootings occur due to mentally unstable people who aren't always criminal masterminds. Nicholas Cruz, who killed 17 people, bought his AR-15 legally and he was mentally unstable. In Switzerland, you can basically also buy any gun you want but you have to prove that you are mentally stable and that you are able to operate the weapon. It's for this reason that shootings in Switzerland and Massachusetts are very rare compared to the South. This is coming from someone who actually likes guns. It's not about the guns, it's about who has the guns. So, to answer your question, basically anyone who is educated enough and mentally stable enough to handle the weapon.",2021-10-26T15:50:30+00:00

We know that some hospitals have already implemented policies and fired the staff who did not comply, so there's probably some good empirical data there already.

[Here's a survey](https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553\(21\)00648-9/fulltext#%20) from October which looked at three hospitals in Chicago, showing that 18% of nurses were intending to remain unvaccinated.

[Here's a graph](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1080003/political-party-identification-state-us/) showing that many red states are ~45% Republican. So extrapolating, maybe around 25% of nurses in red states were intending to remain unvaccinated as of October.

So let's assume maybe 75% of workers who were intending to remain unvaccinated fold under the threat of termination. That would be 4-6% of the nurses terminated depending on the state.

As an example, last year when mask mandates were starting, my state didn't put out statewide mandates, but many counties did. When the state health department plotted counties that had mask mandates and counties that didn't, it turned out that counties without mask mandates had lower incidence of covid than counties with mandates. Rather than present these facts to the state representatives who were trying to decide whether to impose a statewide mandate, they plotted counties with mandates on one scale, and counties without mandates on another scale, arranging it so that if you didn't understand they were different scales, it looked like unmasked counties had higher incidence of covid. The lead state health official then presented this chart to our elected officials to try and convince them to impose mask mandates. He got caught and shamed for it, but he still had his job.

So you're right, science shouldn't be a political position, but when scientists have a political position and have a record of presenting the data to further their agenda, is a layman still supposed to take their information at face value?",2021-12-04T13:25:39+00:00

During the 2019-2020 flu season, 51.8% of people ages six months and older got a flu vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)....To get there, with this virus we just need a little higher level of vaccination, not just in the US, but world wide.

As for disruption, it is unlikely that this disruption will ever reach the level when it first surfaced; that was about survival. Regardless of the variant the basic vaccine still provides considerable protection and we are way passed that time when we had no vaccine.

2 Michigan seats on the 6th circuit were held up 8 and 10 years.  Democrats blue slipped and filibustered GOP nominations as retaliation for their previous blocking of their nominees for the seats.

Seat 9 on the 7th circuit was held up for 7 years under Obama.  That was a seat for WI and previously the split delegation from WI agreed to a bipartisan commission to advance nominees. Ron Johnson decided to fck around with it to waste time.  They redesigned the commission iirc and it produced a moderate liberal judge so Johnson got one of the republican commissioners to change their vote.  Thus it deadlocked.

Suddenly once Trump won and GOP had the senate they decided to advance a nominee, abandoning the commission.  So it was all just an effort to waste time and hold the seat open.  Dem Senator Baldwin blue slipped the judge to no avail as now GOP decided to disregard that convention even though dems had respected it for them under Obama.

So federal vacancies have been held open for a decade recently.  In the future dems seem favoured to hold the presidency and GOP the senate so perpetually unfilled seats could be the norm.  I expect that dems will hand the presidency to republicans after 3-4 cycles so GOP can go on a filling spree for all the vacancies they held up.  Meanwhile dems are unlikely to take the senate as they concentrate into fewer states even if they are a supermajority of the population.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,health,eoglfms,BERNIE_IS_A_FRAUD,,"As I mentioned elsewhere in this thread, I would not support the government mandating new vaccines if those vaccines are not properly tested and safe for public use. I am not a doctor and don't have expertise in the field of clinical research, but as best I can tell there are already systems in place to ensure that medicine (especially vaccines required by the government for school attendance) are safe for public use. The premise of my argument rests on the reasonable assumption that the safety of government-mandated vaccines is well established, because it currently is. Should the status quo in the United States change, and suddenly anything that anyone calls a drug or a vaccine instantly gets to market without proper screening, and the government starts or considers mandating people to take those drugs or vaccines, then I will happily revise my position. Until then, let's stick to reality. 

On your second question about parental custody, I submit that failing to vaccinate medically eligible children is akin to negligently endangering the welfare of those children -- in much the same way that a parent who is addicted to drugs or improperly stores firearms in their home endangers their children and so would be liable to lose custody of their kids. To make matters worse, failing to vaccinate one's child against potentially deadly or disfiguring diseases harms not only the individual child in question, but also other children (and adults) who rely on herd immunity. So from a utilitarian perspective refusals to vaccinate may do more harm than abuse that's confined to the individual child, as in the aforementioned cases of drugs and guns. Hence it is totally reasonable to remove the child from that sort of a parenting environment.",2019-05-22T21:26:05+00:00

I don't think these bills will move the needle on the current standings for abortion.  They could have made something that would have chipped away at it, but these bills are made in such extreme that it would be really hard to over turn it with these. This means they either think they can swing for the home run to make abortion not only difficult but straight illegal or they don't want these to pass.  

This leads me into my second point and what I truly believe it to be and that is they do not want this to pass.  Abortion is the holy grail of issue advocacy that can be used to motivate their base to show up at the polls.  They campaign on it, make it a single issue race and that no other issue is important.  Once elected you have to pay it off by passing something especially when in a state where you own both the state house and senate and possibly even the judicial branch.  It would be easy to pass any form of abortion restrictions some of which could even get some moderates to join in on.  

The problems is this you give your base a victory they and they walk away satisfied that something gets done.  This will mean lower turn out and potential for huge losses at the polls.  No political party can afford this, so what they do is pass legislation and make sure it has a poison pill that will make it not stand up in the courts.

**Protecting the Sacred Right to Vote for Black Families and Communities**  
Since their first days in office, President Biden and Vice President Harris have prioritized strengthening our democracy and protecting the sacred right to vote in free, fair, and secure elections. To do so, the President has:

* Signed an Executive Order to leverage the resources of the Federal Government to provide nonpartisan information about the election process and increase access to voter registration. Agencies across the Federal Government are taking action to respond to the President’s call for an all-of-government effort to enhance the ability of all eligible Americans to participate in our democracy.
* Repeatedly and forcefully called on Congress to pass essential legislation, including the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, including calling for an exception to the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation.
* Increased funding for the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, which has more than doubled the number of voting rights enforcement attorneys. The Justice Department also created the Election Threats Task Force to assess allegations and reports of threats against election workers, and investigate and prosecute these matters where appropriate.
* Signed into law the bipartisan Electoral Reform Count Act, which establishes clear guidelines for our system of certifying and counting electoral votes for President and Vice President, to preserve the will of the people and to protect against the type of attempts to overturn our elections that led to the January 6 insurrection.

**Addressing the Crisis of Gun Violence in Black Communities**  
Gun violence has become the leading cause of death for all youth and Black men in America, as well as the second leading cause of death for Black women. To address this national crisis, the President has:

* Launched the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, and taken more executive action on gun violence than any President in history, including investments in violence reduction strategies that address the root causes of gun violence and address emerging threats like ghost guns. In 2022, the Administration’s investments in evidence-based, lifesaving programs combined with aggressive action to stop the flow of illegal guns and hold shooters accountable yielded a 12.4% reduction in homicides across the United States.
* Signed into the law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun violence reduction legislation enacted in nearly 30 years, including investments in violence reduction strategies and historic policy changes to enhance background checks for individuals under age 21, narrow the dating partner loophole in the gun background check system, and provide law enforcement with tools to crack down on gun trafficking.
* Secured the first-ever dedicated federal funding stream for community violence intervention programs, which have been shown to reduce violence by as much as 60%. These programs are effective because they leverage trusted messengers who work directly with individuals most likely to commit gun violence, intervene in conflicts, and connect people to social, health and wellness, and economic services to reduce the likelihood of violence as an answer to conflict.",2024-05-02T03:17:03+00:00

Progressive,comment,health,gbmeb02,Madsplattr,,"Very scary times indeed and we must be strong and so must our institutions. Our government is built for the people by the people of the people and that means Republicans must be strong, too, in accepting reality and cutting out their party's orange-colored cancer. Meanwhile on the TV Sunday morning news circuit they are talking about how some moderate Dems are all upset blaming progressive Dems for this cycle's losses. The albatross is socialism to paraphrase what someone said. So we have this interesting moment where the crazy part of the right is in charge and the moderate part of the left is in charge and vowing to work with everyone (winks to progressive moderates with Kamala) and many americans are frightened of getting covid and or losing everything because of it. The only way for the Republicans to exorcise the crazy Trumper mentality and regain control is to lose hard; we are going to see the EV total climb to 306, what Trump won against Clinton, Biden has rebuilt back. So he is gonna cry and fuss and seek recourse from the states. He will lose again! Then he will seek it through the courts. These guys are going to lose at least three ""times"" ... And it's that kind of losing, the total battering and the reputational and society effects and the damage to the process that is going to make the last four years a sort of high watermark moment for the insane right; they will be talking about this for years but if Biden and the Dems are even just a quarter effective that they claim then this is the last of it.

I am assuming you are not a farmer or a grower. You probably don’t know how to grow plants in a greenhouse. You might be interested to know that when growers want more plants, they use a CO2 generators to create more CO2. 

So, the idea that more CO2 leads to worse outcomes is a) debatable, and b) not based on the history of the Earth. The Earth is currently at some of the lowest levels of CO2 ever. 

Econ 101 is not about combating pollution…lol. That would be government policy. Econ is concerned with the economy. More taxes means less money for consumers to spend and invest, to start business, to pay for good and services, which in turn leads to fewer jobs. More taxes means less disposable income, which leads to fewer businesses, and fewer jobs. Less taxes leads to a much better economy. It’s why Ireland has a booming economy and why Americas economy outperforms Europes. It is due to lower taxes, not more taxes. 

I know this makes you mad, I can see it in your tone. 

Furthermore, wind, solar, and electricity cannot generator the same amount of energy as natural gas and coal and nuclear. We have been trying for 20 years, and the technology is not there. You cannot have powerful equipment that is not fueled by fossil fuels. And you cannot power towns and cities without nuclear, coal, or gas.

You should look at the cobalt mines in Africa. Or the inability to properly dispose of electric batteries. Or the inefficiency of wind powered turbines. They are more dirty than any natural gas plant or nuclear plant .

Geopolitics,post,health care,3p0bje,thewaltzingbear,Why do anthropologists and other social scientists hate Jared Diamond?,"There was a thread the other day about good books about geopolitics and a lot of people mentioned Jared Diamond, who wrote Guns, Germs and Steel and Collapse (among others). After some questions about why he isn't liked, I mentioned I’d create a separate thread to share some articles about Diamond and his work, and to explain why social scientists (particularly in Anthropolgy and Geography) revile him. (Disclaimer: I’m an academic geographer myself).

Alright, so why do academic social scientists hate Jarod Diamond?

1.	He’s unethical in his research practice. 
He has taken people’s stories without their consent, fabricated altered key portions of the stories to fit his narratives, published an article about them in the New Yorker that portrayed them as unrepentant killers. In doing so, he put the people he wrote about in danger in their home. As a result, research participants have sued Diamond for his unethical practices.
Source [1] (http://www.imediaethics.org/jared-diamonds-factual-collapse/), 
Source [2] (http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/21/new-yorker-jared-diamond-business-media-new-yorker.html), 
Source [3] (http://io9.com/5226368/jared-diamond-sued-by-new-guinea-natives-for-crimes-of-anthropology).

2.	He doesn’t substantiate his arguments and cherry picks evidence to make huge, otherwise unsubstantiated claims about the world at large. He ignores evidence that contradicts his claims, and he doesn’t include citations and footnotes to support his own.
 “Diamond is a generalist and will always paint with a brush that a specialist finds too broad. The danger lies not in simplifying source material by leaving out extraneous details, but in selectively highlighting only the facts that support one’s argument and casting contravening cases aside.” [Source here, which also goes into greater detail about the problems] (http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/books/2013/02/jared_diamond_the_world_until_yesterday_anthropologists_are_wary_of_lack.html)

3.	He treats European colonialism and domination as an accidental history, ignoring choice and politics. Instead he rests on environmental determinist meganarratives, which have long been challenged by social scientists. 
[“…just because you have guns and steel does not mean you should use them for colonial and imperial purposes.”] (http://www.livinganthropologically.com/anthropology/guns-germs-and-steel/) He makes these violences seem natural, inevitable, but “the mere capacity to behave brutally does not absolve [one] from having done so.” He removes the question of human agency (in GGS) and depoliticizes histories of domination in ways that are really damaging. (That link also does a good job of critiquing Collapse too).

4.	He treats living societies as unchanging relics in a way that is deeply disturbing (both intellectually and ethically) to most social scientists.
Here is a passage from an [NPR article] (http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2013/01/14/169374400/why-does-jared-diamond-make-anthropologists-so-mad)  of Diamond that sums this up. 
“I was startled at this passage on the jacket of The World Until Yesterday: ""While the gulf that divides us from our primitive ancestors may seem unbridgably wide, we can glimpse most of our former lifestyle in those largely traditional societies that still exist or were recently in existence."" This statement turns small-scale societies into living fossils, the human equivalent of ancient insects hardened in amber. That's nonsense, of course.” Another quote on this problem: “Clearly these Dani people, like the others who fill The World Until Yesterday, contend with contemporary challenges and problems, and one of these is in fact the notion that they belong to the past and so can be pushed aside, even dispossessed, in order to make way for progress. The truth is that they, like all of us, live in the present. To persist in portraying them as the living relics of our ancestors’ time is to return to an arrogant anthropology of yesterday that is empirically unjustified, morally untenable, and for most anthropologists, thankfully, left behind.” [Source] (http://anthropologyreport.com/anthropology-jared-diamond-world-until-yesterday/)

There are TONS of articles out there that go into greater detail about all this. Here are a few:

[David Correia] (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10455752.2013.846490?journalCode=rcns20)
“Jared Diamond is back at it, once again trading in the familiar determinist tropes that earned him a Pulitzer Prize for his 1999 book Guns, Germs, and Steel….At best it is just silly, as when he offers unsupported and unsupportable assertions…At worst it develops an argument about human inequality based on a determinist logic that reduces social relations such as poverty, state violence, and persistent social domination, to inexorable outcomes of geography and environment…He disguises the racism of his biological and environmental determinism in a Kiplingesque narrative that seems downright thoughtful and caring.”

Liberal,comment,health care,gcjwutf,Jin-roh,,"Others have said this: but you have shown a great deal of patience and forebearance with your father. You obviously care deeply about this relationship. You've shown more patience than almost anyone I can think of in this matter.

There's a few things you might want to consider though: is conservatism about rationality?

This is not a tongue and cheek question. It's serious. When someone in my facebook feed or in my friends circles cites Breitbart or similar sources unironically, I've learned that they're not operating based on reason, evidence, or logic. I can remember one instance in which a friend cited the Daily Wire. I engaged him in a good faith, patient conversation, about some of the things it said. Mainly, it alleged something about a proposed law, when the actual text of the law said that it designed to do the exact opposite. I presented my friend with this, and he wanted to continue the conversation as if we needed to ""hear both sides"" of the issue, despite the fact that his source had misrepresented things.

I literally do not know how to explain to something that primary source (the text of the proposed Law) corrects the reporting secondary source (The daily wire article), about what \*itself\*. I literally do not know how to explain to a conservative how fact checking works.

If you've felt this similiar frustration with your father, than I would not encourage you to continue with this organized debates. The disagreement has gone well beyond investigation, and into epistemology.

I once listened to a podcast that described ""conservative brain"" versus ""liberal brain."" Conservatives have a measurable fear/negativity bias. This doesn't mean everything they say is wrong, but it does mean that they'll find certain appeals much more persuasive than liberals would. I've also heard it argued that conservativism means ""a strong need for a rigid order"" and preference for the tried and comfortable rather than the novel. I've heard it described that conservativism is fundamentally about maintaining social hierarchies.

I've also read about ""motivated reasoning.""

If you start looking at conservativism as \*disposition\*, a list of personality traits, and prefered types of moral/rhetorical appeals, than conservativism makes more sense.",2020-11-16T23:25:26+00:00

>Duh? That's what a plea deal is for. You charge them for a small crime and drop all of the bigger ones in return for them working with investigators.

But again, Mueller has to prove that a crime was committed. If he wants to nail Trump on conspiracy charges, he needs to *show the crime occurred.* To do this, federal prosecutors will have the lower level operatives plead guilty to the actual crime, and implicate Trump as complicit, in exchange for sentencing leniency. 

Mueller didn't do this. He only charged Flynn with lying to the FBI, which makes his testimony worthless in court (since he admitted to perjury already). What is the crime? Mueller can't make the case that Trump was complicit in a criminal conspiracy without first securing a conviction for the alleged crime.

Did Flynn provide valuable information to investigators? Maybe. Maybe they learned some details of behind-the-scenes communication which could help them go after Trump Jr. But it's not at all valuable in a courtroom because Flynn's testimony won't carry any weight.

Politics,comment,health care,jaisfnn,TitsUpYo,,"Then the argument rests on the fact that transitioning is recognized as the legitimate medical treatment for gender dysphoria. So regardless of the issue of consent, a minor is entitled to medical treatment and thus they should be able to transition to treat their gender dysphoria. It is no different than a child receiving medical treatment for any number of other disorders.

As I said, gender dysphoria presents in many ways. It is an extremely broad topic. I cannot speak for other trans people and what they experience. I have only my experiences, which are unique to me. I'm about to write a lot and you can choose to read it or not, but it is one trans experience that might enlighten why someone transitions.

  
I'm intersex and transgender. I've been hypogonadic my entire life due to being intersex. I never developed body hair or facial hair. I developed wide hips. And I had gyno as a teen. I won't say I was extremely feminine, but I was also not masculine. I discovered that I was hypogonadic in my 20s. I just thought I was undergoing puberty really slowly and would eventually come into being a man. That never manifested because of the intersex condition (XXY). 

I dealt with severe identity issues as a result of it. Growing up as a teen without the effects of testosterone, the key ingredient of what makes a man a man will do that to you. I spent a lot of time pretending to be a girl online when I was a teenager. I spent a lot of time wandering what it would have been like to have been a woman. I felt torn between two worlds. This was all many years before trans stuff was in the mainstream. I had no idea you could even undergo hormone therapy to induce biological changes to be more like another sex. 

I became aware of HRT and trans people in the late 2000s. And I came close to pulling the trigger on it, then, but I ended up trying testosterone replacement therapy instead. I figured that if I just had testosterone in my system I would finally feel right. 

And I absolutely hated it. I was miserable on TRT. It made me feel terrible. I was constantly angry. I hated interacting with the world. The yearning to be a woman grew stronger than ever. After about a year I stopped taking it and my resolve to switch to estrogen became absolutely firm. And so I did and I found it so much more agreeable physically and mentally. I cannot enumerate the ways in which it made me feel better. It is not an experience anyone else could understand because they are not me and they cannot feel the way I feel.

I don't personally see myself as a woman. I don't tell other people to call me a woman. I don't even discuss my gender with others at all. I let them decide what gender I am. I'm at the point now where most people think I'm a woman. I even recently started using the men's lockers and restrooms again after a decade of using the women's (with no issue using them) out of fear of becoming fodder in the right wing culture war. And you know what happens? I get endlessly harassed for being a woman in men's spaces. Men keep trying to put me into women's lockers and restrooms.

My church advocated for same-sex marriage in Minnesota. Should we have kept silent on the issue because some people aren't comfortable with a church taking a position, even if they agree with it? (We got guff from both sides.)

What if my beliefs include respecting the human dignity for all created in the Divine Image?

What if my faith advocates for creation care, comprehensive women's reproductive health care, eliminating generational poverty, equal access to opportunity, ending mass incarceration, comprehensive and just immigration reform among other issues?

The Bible talks about the experience of exile in several places: the feeling of being uprooted, unwelcomeness, estrangement, alienation and the deep longing that accompanies these. When faith comes up in progressive circles, I experience a lot of exile. It hurts.

Democrats,comment,health insurance,faeitu7,cerberus698,,"Mostly that the Freedom Dividend doesn't go far enough and its funding structure is regressive in nature.

There are basically 3 major problems with it.

1) UBI is supposed to provide a basic acceptable standard of living deemed appropriate by society. 1,000 a month will never meet that definition. Yang has stated that the $1,000 will be a base to build off of but I'd hope that we've learned from Obama that your landmark entitlement legislation needs to be implemented in its entirety with in 2 to 4 years or else the Republicans will either dismantle it or starve it to death at their first opportunity.

2) Its designed to be eaten by land lords. You can have your UBI, or you can have your existing benefits. The problem with exchanging SNAP for cash is that your landlord, ISP, car insurance company, the 7/11 on the corner by your house etc. can accept that money for anything you want to spend it on. SNAP and other benefit programs have a lot of hurdles attached to them that make it more difficult for anyone other than its intended recipient to collect on. 

3) One of its major funding vectors is a VAT tax. This is inherently regressive and will effect poor people, the people most likely to be helped by the dividend, most severely. For those of you who don't know how a VAT works, it means value added tax and its collected by the government at any point in a products production process where value is added to the original materials. So, if you have a block of wood and that block gets sold to a factory that makes figurines, it gets taxed at a flat rate based on the new value of the item after labor has been applied to it. Say it then goes to another factory to be painted and packaged, another flat tax is applied to it. This process continues until it reaches its final point of sale. The problem with this is that the tax gets passed on to the person who buys it. This taxation method will always disproportionately hurt low income people.

I've also got some issues with the things he's said. He's given some credence to the idea that America becoming a white minority country is a bad thing which is kind of an entry point to the alt-right. I'm not accusing Yang of being alt-right, just that he has parroted talking points in the past, I believe either through ignorance or just having a misguided opinion on such things.",2019-12-10T18:14:54+00:00

Libertarian,post,health insurance,eysuxm,TheNotConjuring,Why Capitalism Will Fails,"* China is often praise for having a free market economy with a communist government because China pulled itself out of poverty faster than anyone in Asia. Yet, there are kids who working to sweatshops, getting paid pennies, managers telling them to lie to the government inspectors working less hours than what they actually did or even lie about having days off. 
* Before government regulations in America, kids were not in school, and were working in poor conditions, for pennies, long  hours, and with no days off. Thank god for minimum wage laws, 40 hour work weeks, regulations that mandate companies must make the work place safe. But since states require kids (usually between ages 5-16 mandate) that they go their kids go to school and hold parents accountable, Libertarian are going to complain “about meh freedom being infringed”.
* Without government regulation, the pay gap would shrink for woman. It still exist, but it has gotten a lot better since the 1970s. 
* People are not able to live off of minimum wage. I often hear about how these are entry levels jobs. Tell that to parents who are struggling to pay rent and have kids with 10 years of work experience. That’s not “entry level”. Thank god for benefits too so families can have coverage. 
* How can I forget about health care? Health care and health insurance is a natural right. Other countries have a single payer system. France, Belgium, and Britain have the best health care in the world. People live longest in countries with Universal Health Care. This should be a Libertarian ideology. Libertarians often say how the governments only job is to protect human rights. Right to life, health, and safety is a human right. And everyone (but the rich) pays taxes.",2020-02-04T16:45:41+00:00

Neoliberal,comment,healthcare costs,gg20nbo,ThankMrBernke,,">At the time the country needed rebuilding (ie, use of its natural and industrial resources) whilst simultaneously needing an immediate solution for an imminent glut of labour returning from the front. On top of that, the entire economy had already been effectively nationalised anyway during the war, and was running at war production levels that simply were not sustainable.

What's the best way to rebuild the country? The war is over, now we have to be thinking about how to develop the economy in a way that will provide sustainable growth and prosperity over the long term. Our country still has great shortages and there is much work to be done- we must switch from a war footing, to a peace footing that will preserve Britain's strength and prosperity for future generations. Expanding nationalisation continues us down that wrong path. There are shortages of goods and there is plenty of work to be done. The clearest example of which are the price controls being proposed by all major parties in building materials (prices are rising because there aren't enough to go around!) and the fact that war rationing seems set to stay for a while. There may be a glut of labour for a short period, but there is plenty of work to be done and Britian will recover fastest from the war with a strong foundation for future prosperity.

The Reid Report has shown that our nationalised industries such as coal are already underperforming their peers abroad. While full privatisation of the coalfields are not feasible for the moment, we should make sure that they are free from the dictates of the state and run as much like private businesses as they can be in preparation for that day. Labour, on the other hand, wishes to expand this fiasco to other parts of the economy. Labour takes our economy in the wrong direction, and mark my words, taking this path will blow up in our faces. The effects may not be made apparent immediately, but they will be made apparent in due course. The Conservatives offer the clearest route to back to a prosperous peacetime economy. 

>Is it neoliberal? No of course not. But then again the Liberal manifesto calls for control of prices in housing materials and full employment. If we're being uneconomically efficient in those ways, why not just double down and have it centrally directed?

Because our goal is to limit the damage. Yes, price controls are bad, so is central planning. Just because we're doing one bad thing doesn't mean that we should do two bad things!

>Also Labour give us the NHS which is lit-a-rooni.

All parties have pledged to deliver a national health service this election. 

Churchill has led this country successfully through the worst war in our national history. I trust in him, and it's time for the Conservatives to successfully lead us through peace. 

OOC: My original answer was flippant, though I would argue still correct. In character there are good reasons to oppose the Labour party's policies, but with the benefit of hindsight [it's even more obvious.](https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1229111274463584256) Nationalization of the commanding heights was a disaster and gave Britain a few decades of economic stagnation. Even Germany ended rationing 4 years before the UK, for christsakes!

Point 1 in the sidebar makes this exceptionally clear:

>Individual choice and markets are of paramount importance both as an expression of individual liberty and driving force of economic prosperity.

Nationalization is pretty much the direct opposite of this. I'd be hesitant to vote for any Labour party candidate before Blair, tbh.",2020-12-16T18:33:21+00:00

California was listed in your article as taking in the most federal dollars for a solid blue state (#2 over all). Which is true. BUT Florida also put in the most. The wikipedia article shows the revenue and spending per capita for california. Overall california had a net contribution of $1,466 per capita. So your article points out overall spending while ignoring contributions.

Democrats don't vote for auterity because it is bad economic policy. If you had gotten a subsidised higher education (and the large amount of the debt that still comes with it), maybe you would understand how a federal budget is not a household budget and that cutting federal spending during a reccession is a terrible plan. (I do agree that part of the problem is when we do have a boom the goverment doesn't use that time to pay down the debts accrued pulling us out of a recession, for example when we had an economic boom in the bush years republicans gave across the board tax cuts and started unfunded wars instead of paying down debt with the surplus revenue)

Also the reason they want to get a higher education is so they can get a good job, which they will then pay more taxes on their higher salary with. That hardly seems lazy, it seems like good planning and working hard with the future in mind.

The Obama phone video is of course hillarious.

Politics,post,healthcare costs,hc5j6w,VoteAlexLee,"Hey Reddit! I’m Alex Lee, a 24 year old former State Legislative Staffer now running for CA State Assembly in the Bay Area. AMA!","Hello! My name is Alex Lee, and I am the Democratic candidate for California's Assembly District 25 (San José-Fremont-Santa Clara). While California is often seen to be a progressive state, I put my progressive values in action by rejecting all corporate, fossil fuel, police, and developer money. 

My story is familiar to many in my district, being raised in the heart of Silicon Valley by immigrant parents from Hong Kong, I have seen the incredible diversity of my community as well as the unique problems it faces. Being a member of Gen Z, I have struggled like many people my age to afford the costs of college and have been virtually locked out of the Bay Area's incredibly expensive housing market. 

Today I'm fighting to change the conditions that have pushed out so many people from my community. [My campaign is focused on these issues](http://www.votealexlee.com/my-priorities.html): 

Housing Affordability: Expanding and mandating mixed-income housing construction across the state and introducing legislation to provide Social Housing options. Increasing tenant protections against corporate landlords and introducing rent-forgiveness programs for residential and small business tenants.

Ending Homelessness: Expanding the state budget for transitional and permanent supportive housing for the unhoused, improving and increasing social services and resources for low income and unemployed people and families.

Expanding and Improving Public Transit: Reprioritizing state dollars for rail and transit infrastructure expansion and accessibility, and improving bicycle and last-mile transit options.

Reinvesting into Education: Making public colleges tuition-free, reinvesting in K-12 schools, and raising teacher salaries far above starvation wages.

I also champion progressive legislation that will help all Californians including Healthcare for All, the Green New Deal, and increasing taxes on corporations and the 1%.

My campaign has been almost entirely grassroots and I'm proud to say that my volunteers and I have knocked over 30,000 doors before the COVID19 pandemic. In the March primary I beat 7 other Democrats and was outspent 15 to 1. 

If elected I will be the youngest Asian-American to serve in the California Legislature as well as the first openly bisexual legislator in California history. 

I also am happy to talk to all of you on this historic holiday of Juneteenth! 

While Juneteenth marks the end of slavery across the United States, it’s a reminder to us that the fight for equality is far from over. People all over the nation are rising up in outrage because Black Americans have been subjugated to systematic racism for far too long. Once in office, I will be working to end state-sanctioned violence by redistributing California's budget and resources allocated towards militarized policing and mass incarceration in the communities most affected by police violence, as well as expanding and bolstering services that aim to uplift historically marginalized Californians.

The math is ridiculously. Health care in the US costs double what it does in other western countries (for a variety of reasons not all related to profit maximizing, but that too).  


Which means providing healthcare for employees is more expensive as well.

If you're a sufficiently large company and your workforce is sufficiently centralized you can realize a greater than 100% ROI (most healthcare costs go to old people) on healthcare expenditures by offering European style healthcare to your under 65 employees, use large scale collective bargaining advantages intelligently, and along with mandatory retirement.

Libertarian,comment,hospital,hbyi5fg,bburgers9,,"Its due to the utter lack of consistency in rhetoric on the part of the politicians pushing these policies. Democratic politicians routinely being caught in public not wearing masks, not social distancing, eating at restaurants maskless that are supposed to be closed, etc, and all this throughout the height of the pandemic. Democrats tweeting that they'll never trust a vaccine created by the Trump administration, then doing a complete about-face as soon as Biden got into office. 

In addition, democrats spend a lot of time accusing any opposition of ignoring science while they themselves are only cherry-picking the science that supports the narrative they're pushing. Hardly a peep from any dems or the mainstream media about the Israel study that showed that people who've recovered from covid are actually better protected than those who took the vaccine. Nothing about how healthy  kids, teenagers, young adults, and even middle aged adults are extremely unlikely to develop severe complications, let alone die from covid. The average age of a covid death during the height of the pandemic was in the mid 70s. Hardly a peep about the cdc coming out and saying that the Pfizer and moderna vaccines are losing potency by up to 35% after 6 months. 

And if you want to ignore all that, then you can't disregard the simple fact that the federal government, the pharmaceutical companies, and the mainstream media are all extremely untrustworthy institutions, and they're all pushing the same narrative extremely hard. I have pretty much every vaccine known to man, but the way our government is trying to force this particular vaccine down everyone's throats, almost desperately, it's made me more than a little suspicious, suspicious enough to hold off on taking the vaccine for now, especially since I got covid and recovered already.

Edit: I also forgot to mention that in more recent times, dems, the media, even Fauci all completely ignored massive concerts, festivals, parties, etc with crowds of hundreds of thousands or even millions not wearing masks, not social distancing, but as soon as a few thousand conservatives gather somewhere to protest, it's a ""super spreader event"".

PoliticalDiscussion,post,hospital,1tvhsy,neva4get,Why don't the churches in the USA demand improved taxpayer funded services for the poor and disadvantaged?,"I am from the pacific island nation of Stralia, and here the organisations most involved in lobbying the government for increased taxpayer funded services for the poor and disadvantaged are the major churches. They spend millions campaigning for taxpayer money to be spent on increasing the unemployment benefit, housing refugees, and providing free healthcare. If these services are inadequate, the churches will turn the media against the government. And then they personally benefit from this money, as they help administer some aspects as third party contractors - e.g. they run jobsearch agencies, administer pastoral care to refugees, house homeless, run hospitals, etc, on the taxpayer dollar.

From this reddit post it is clear that some of these services are quite poor in the USA

http://imgur.com/a/WIfeN

What is also clear, from the Bush era, is that many churches support a republican philosophy of social services, as religious support was very helpfull to g.w. Bush's two terms.

I appreciate that churches do a tremendous amount for private charity and to help the poor. **I am not posting to argue whether state funded services are better or worse than a libertarian model**, 

The churches would be massive beneficiaries of increased state funded services, it is consistent with christian ideology, from their perspective it makes sense from both a practical and idelogical standpoint to lobby the government for 'socialist' services. 

If the churches lobbied for this, the system would change overnight I assume, their political power being considerable.

Medicare and Medicaid have a duty, you could say to us taxpayers, to keep costs down.  This leads to them reimbursing providers below cost in many cases.  That leaves the private payers (Aetna, United, Humana, etc) to pay much more than Medicare/Medicaid to make up the difference, so that the hospitals and providers can at least cover costs.  Those private payers then shift their cost onto employers via higher premiums every year.  The employers pass that cost onto employees (most of us working folk) in 2 ways: 1) higher premium deductions from your paycheck and 2) forgoing wage increases (each dollar the employer pays to the health insurance company is a dollar they can’t pay you in wages).

>Begin centralizing authority and decision making within the Democratic Party as a whole...effectively banning \*small donations\* to individual candidates

The only meaningful result this would be is to cut off what little legs the democrats have, ground game is conducted by volunteers, volunteers come from people enthusiastic about candidates and you need an enthusiastic base to have an effective local party system. if you take any real choice away you're not going to get the so called strong parties you admire, but because we live in a two party system  and not a plurality  people will correctly only see this as the party completely alienating them and the democrats already dying support structures will worsen.

>Keir Starmer's actions in the last few years reforming intra-party policy

Kier isn't winning anything back that the labour party has lost, he's just less obtrusive, which given the structure of british government isn't translating into any real gain in power so much as it is that they're just dying more quietly now.

>local issues

empty buzzword, in this day and age, used only by those who don't want to actually discuss what policies they specifically want to pursue. More importantly though,  although it was once said that all politics is local that has become reversed in our modern era all politics is national. Massive right wing media forces and conspiracism override whatever local concerns people would have had otherwise and the fact that people change jobs constantly, move far more frequently, and don't participate in any kind of local organizations or religious communities means that people have no connection to their local world. One of the outgrowths of this is that nationally motivated frenzies become debated locally where officials have no power. See the ongoing grooming book crisis, a thing i have seen in local library board meetings and pta meetings. People attend these meetings to debate the issues of child sex trafficing and accuse town officials of busing in migrants. People pursue positions of power within these orgs and then get argumentative during meetings when they don't understand why the treasurer don't have personal veto power over whether or not the library has LGBT books or a spanish language section.  You can't beat that by promising to bring jobs to downtown or by finally fixing that pothole on 9th street.

>It's no secret the liberal trending cultural values in the last decade are responsible for alienating the working class voters who used be reliable blue voters. What values do we need to abandon? I don't know for sure, but a serious analysis needs to be conducted and hard choices need to be made.

What a delicate little dance you do, carefully pirouetting around saying what you mean to say.  Its cowardly. If you're going to suggest betraying groups of supporters have the courage to say exactly who you're gunna throw to the wolves. More to the point though, it wouldn't even work. The entire arc of the right wing over last twenty two years from iraq to birtherism to qanon has been grounded in overtly lying to do what they decided they wanted to do, in a wide variety of shapes and forms. It doesn't matter what you say you do or don't believe, they'll just make something up.  Falsehood as a tactic is used at every level of the republican party, if you abandon an position and move to the right they'll either accuse you of something completely impossible, like the adrenochrome nonsense or accuse you of holding the position in secret. it won't dissuade the right, and even if you win they only thing gained is that the democrat has moved further to the right giving them what they want materially anyway.

>Infiltrate the GOP

So the solution to democrats problems is to alienate their only remaining supporters, abandon their positions to no real gains, and then in earnest begin voting for Republicans. In what way is that plan distinguishable from surrender?

>The GOP is going to become the dominant political party

—

Reporter: But aid to Israel should not be conditioned on Israel’s behavior in the West Bank or human-rights concerns specifically?

Cardin: Right. I believe these are issues we raised with Israel, but it’s not relevant to the supplemental appropriation.

Reporter: Sometimes I wonder whether they get the message if they know aid will come no matter what.

Cardin: I could be wrong about this, and that’s why I’m very supportive of the Ukraine aid and Israel aid remaining tied together. Ukraine is desperate for these funds. It’s important that we provide help to Israel, but it’s not critical as to their ability to defend their country. So it’s much more critical for Ukraine as far as the timeliness of the aid. Iron Dome has saved so many lives in Israel. We need to make sure they have the interceptors they need and the technologies to protect against multiple missiles coming into their country. But, for Israel’s defense, they have the capacity to defend themselves. We need to make sure that we give them what they need. 

—

Thousands of Palestinian children have been killed by the Israeli government’s actions; the number of journalists that have been killed in the last two months by the Israeli government is about the same as the total number of journalists killed in warfare worldwide last year; hospitals and evacuation routes are being bombed; and the Israeli government is not finding evidence of things they say justify some of these actions.

Is there anything Israel could do at this point that would change politicians such as Cardin’s stance? Would that line be different for Democrats and Republicans?

The goal of all quarantines is to limit the R0 (basic reproductive number). What happens is they find the index case, quarantine them and produce a map of all possible contaminated individuals (people they interacted with). If after 14 days of quarantine, there are no new reported cases and no cases outside of the country, then it is effectively quarantined. 14 days for a small group isn’t a lot.

Now it was handled poorly, so we dont get 14 days with a simple group of people. The reality is that you’d need to do a cost-benefit analysis of the total cost of the operationalization + lost revenue over the interval and compare it to

1. Projected total benefit amassed over a person’s life * the amount dead

2. Lost revenue due to sick leave * amount sick (and recovered)

That’s the ball park amount. The true amount would require a differential equation since your total lost revenue compounds because it would have otherwise grown by some percent over an interval of time had they not gotten sick.

The president has the ability to “task” the intelligence community in this manner. This is done under the DNI. If they’re being honest and not playing politics they will be able to determine what happened here pretty quickly. Considering this roused a lot more public anger than Israel is used to, Biden could potentially use this investigation as a sword of Damocles over the head of Bibi whom he doesn’t really get along with, most likely to rein him in before this spins out further. Logically speaking without considering edge cases it’s pretty obvious what happened here as Hamas had never demonstrated the ability to use that kind of munitions. If I had to guess, I’d bet Hamas was firing their peashooters from nearby the hospital and Israel used the opportunity to lay the area to waste not expecting this kind of public backlash.

I will look at prior auth for buy and bill.

Yes, I don't like CVS at all. Reading a bit in the CVS sub, they're own employees are bitching about how horrible it is. Nothing but dysfunctional operation. Next, they have announced 5k layoffs, apparently they want to reduce by another 25k, the 5k now is just the first step. I personally believe that we'll get a recession / depression that will dwarf 2007/08, so that may be much more than 30k layoffs. I have asked in the CVS sub whether or not that will also affect specialty pharma, but got no reply. I am on meds that are not supposed to be discontinued or halted, and my order took a whole week between order and delivery, so I missed a whole week of doses. The instructions mention you may at most miss one (1!!!!!) dose. The calendar in the online system didn't allow me choose an earlier delivery date. A whole week later was my first choice. And I think this will only get worse, with more layoffs coming. Whether or not this will affect specialty pharma I don't know, maybe not, but for sure that a whole week without deliveries was bad enough for me. Never happened to me with other specialty pharmas when I was with another insurance company. I personally think that CVS is such a dysfunctional c\*\*\*\*\*\*f\*\*k that it should be ineligible to handle life-saving meds. They're just not prepared to handle it: personnel, operations, procedures, systems, ... and not liable for anything, and half of the phone conversation is the typical boilerplate ""I am very sorry for the inconvenience this may have caused you."". It's like kindergarten teachers teaching abstract algebra at the universities (oh, sorry, I think we've actually got that now). They don't care if they can't deliver for a whole week, they get the sale anyway, are not liable for anything, so why have an efficient operation? Efficient operation is just another cost item, which must be prevented when they're under cost pressure. People may now come with billions of excuses and ""explanations"", but the fact is that when I look at the \*outcomes\*, the \*results\*, the CVS system doesn't work! Out of meds for a whole week. That is an \*outcome\*, not apologetic theory. It could have got me in hospital, in an extreme case killed me. CVS wouldn't care. They're probably allowed to be unable to deliver life-critical meds for a whole week and are not liable for their inability to deliver sooner.

Sure, they get volume discounts, but that means they go to the lowest bidder, which will always be the worst pharmacy in the country. Ironically, I remember from 2009 that preventing ""going to the lowest bidder"" was the reason the ACA doesn't allow patients to get insurance out of state on the marketplace. So in my state I am left with three bad choices for insurances, but the insurances themselves can go to the lowest bidder, the CVS c\*\*\*\*\*\*f\*\*k.

What is that you imagine happens to people that are denied health care, that have treatment withheld?

Once again, you seem to not understand that killing people for money is fundamentally wrong.

I'm certain that's because it hasn't effected you personally, yet. When it does, your perspective will catch up to reality, but then another group of people will have come up believing all the lies they were raised with, and try to tell you that that isn't what is happening.

You use the funeral industry, as an example, as if it's a good business model. Again, you don't know WTF you're talking about, and **that's the answer to your original question**, expressing the profits of the health insurance industry in dollar terms, rather than as a percentage helps to give people some sense of perspective, to counter people's erroneous beliefs.

It's no different than the erroneous, yet ubiquitous belief that ""lowering taxes encourages business to expand"". It is contradicted by 100% of the evidence, but you don't have to look for more than a couple of seconds to find somebody that will argue the point.

I know people who always have people at home so having firearms always out isn't a bad idea because they all know how to properly handle them.  Safes are generally a good idea, but they are not a moral imperative in every scenario.  And as I said, there are different kinds of safes.

Lying in wait with a gun is infinitely superior to a baseball bat.  You have more range, more deterrence, and more incapacitation.  All good things when defending your life.  And no one has ever advocated for not calling the police.  However, like the tried and true adage goes, when seconds count, police are minutes away.  From an incapacitation perspective, shotguns are better than handguns.  What this has to do with anything, either than a snide attempt to say we should throw semi-auto handguns into the sea I do not know.

If help is on the way, you are better off barricading and staying in a single spot WITH A GUN.  A gun does nothing but make you safer in that situation whether the police are 30 seconds away or 30 light years away.

However, the US, not having as powerful unions on a *national* level (city based unions could be quite powerful!) meant new entrans to the labor market were largely free of competing against union supported workers. This helped many African Americans aquire good, blue collar jobs in mid-western cities and helped successive waves of immigrants to aquire employment and thus prosper.

The issue now is that labor is a lot tighter broadly in the US yet workers never built up that nation level unionism so capital has much greater leverage than workers otherwise could of.

Its also arguable that the neoliberal reforms of the UK and Germany's prexisting liberal economic policies and postioning in the EU helped lead to the countries attracting many Euro and non-Euro immigrants thus why it seems odd that France, which still maintains powerful unions, has had such difficulty in including its migrant populations whilst the UK and Germany less so",2021-03-19T16:09:24+00:00

We have just witnessed the end of an entire way of life, just in to thin air, with nothing but verbal testimonies left to claim that it even happened. Records undoubtedly destroyed or to be destroyed, if not out of malice, in effort to protect those mentioned in those records from the Taliban.

Witnessing this, I can't help but to imagine what those who watched coverage of the fall of Saigon felt. Were they relived to hear that the Americans had been rescued? Relived to know that it was finally over, that no longer would things like Vietnam would occupy a spot in their mind? Or were they angry like me to know that all the blood and gold had been spent for nothing?

For those that felt the former, I'm sure they had their reasons. I know I have mine for being furious. And for all their faults, 

And for all their faults, for a brief glimpse of time Afghanistan had a somewhat liberal democracy. I'm only 22, and I can't help but think that for those in Afghanistan my age who have only even know this way of life, will see it evaporate in their life time.

There’s a good argument to be made that Kacsmaryk does not have the authority and/or jurisdiction to issue a nationwide injunction since he is a district level judge whose district has definitive borders. So with that being said, I think it’s worth starting there with the argument, that he is assuming a power he does not actually possess. Ignoring the Supreme Court would likewise have to take on a similar argument (that they are assuming an authority that the executive branch and/or Congress does not recognize). 

I personally highly doubt that the Biden administration will ignore the court. The Supreme Court outlawing the abortion pill would be an electoral godsend for Democrats, there’s zero chance Biden is going to pick up the rake that republicans would be stepping on there. Ignoring the court is likely going to take something much more extreme than this potential ruling, and I think it will boil down to the executive branch deciding not to recognize a power that the courts are assuming.

Politics,comment,medical debt,c40s515,crazydave333,,"The argument against that is a moral hazard one. If the stimulus paid off everyone's student loan debt, then besides the fairness question of people who already paid their student loan debt before the stimulus was enacted would make such an act politically unpalatable. This would be the same as using the stimulus to pay off all underwater mortgages. It would look unfair to someone who got a smaller house they could afford vs people who were dipshits and got a huge house they were certain to go broke on.

And I realize that not all situations are as black and white as that. There are cases of students who went into a whole lot of debt not because they were incredibly irresponsible, but because they were either not given the correct information, or that information that was correct about a job market when they started ended up changing when the economy went south. This is the same with homeowners, I point out that argument just to say how politically difficult it would be to enact a stimulus you describe.

I'm also not absolving the ""moral hazard"" of giving the money directly to the banks. On one hand, I figured the moral hazard could be abated by adding regulatory strings to the bailout money. I did not account for the fact that Wall Street would turn around and use their money to buy politicians in order to make any regulations worthless and toothless.

OBLIGATORY TIM KAINE INFO:

Mr. Kaine is personally against abortion but still supports the rights of women to have access. Kaine is strongly against Citizens United v FEC and has urged the SEC to require publicly traded companies to disclose political spending. Kaine is against the death penalty, and in 2019 cosponsored a bill to ban it. He believes in climate change and has worked vigorously to fight it, including endorsing making coal energy production cleaner (including using fracking), voted against the Keystone XL pipeline, exporting natural gas, supports solar and wind energy and cosponsored the Climate Security Act of 2019 which would have formed a group in the State Department that would have to integrate climate change into national security. Kaine is a strong supporter of financial regulation and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Kaine supported the normalization of relations with Cuba, the Iran Nuclear Deal, is a staunch supporter of Israel, supported the airstrikes in Yemen initially though has reversed course on that, favors sanctions and much more. He supports background checks and the limiting of sales of combat-style weaponry and high-capacity magazines. He cosponsored the Military Domestic Violence Reporting Enhancement Act, which would have closed a loophole allowing convicted abusers to continue to buy and keep firearms. He also cosponsored the Help Empower Americans to Respond Act, which would have banned suppressors. Kaine and Bennet proposed Medicare X, which would have created a public option modeled on Medicare. Kaine was one of six senators to introduce the American Miners Act of 2019 which would have prevented insolvency of bankrupted coal companies and allowed miners to keep their healthcare. Kaine supports DARPA and DACA. He also supports the idea of allowing illegal immigrants to pay a fine and taxes in order to achieve citizenship. Kaine supports LGBT rights, including gay marriage. Kaine supported raising the FICA payroll tax to extend the solvency of Social Security programs.

But with Medicare not being optional and taking 3.8% of non-wage income and 2.9% of wage income, regardless of your position you want your money worth/back because its not a small amount.

Politics,comment,medicine,drr3t8r,JunahCg,,"My grandmother is 93. She wants out. She has been saying this almost exactly for at least 5 years. Lately, it's changed to ""they're kinder to horses."" I used to have a vaguely pro-death with dignity stance.

Then grandpa got sick. My grandpa died, slowly and painfully, for 6 weeks. He was also 93. I'm not sure the last time he saw grandma, his wife, because she was and usually is in too much pain to leave the house. His last two weeks he was basically catatonic, as they gave him a cocktail of drugs to attempt to ease his considerable pain. He couldn't eat and lost 40 lbs. Whatever the last thing he tried to say to me was I'll never know, 'cause he was too weak to speak.

Like I said, it took him 6 weeks to die. He had said he'd like to go after only a few weeks, then it took a few more to die miserably. Back when he could still speak and remember who we were and could concievably consent to the logistics of it. Back when he could have had his wife there with him.

Not like money is anywhere near the main issue, but he used all his last money just to die. Forget whatever inheritance he worked his whole life hoping to give to the family, there's nothing to cover grandma's living expenses. If he knew that was happening I'm sure he'd be morified.

Doing this to my grandfather was inhumane. A system that will let you get to 93 despite god's best attempts to kill you, but then tells you you've got to wait until it's ""your time"" is horseshit. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.",2017-12-25T21:38:40+00:00

>Patent regulation

You mean no one should be able to hold a patent? Where do we draw the line between ""the government can't encroach upon your right to business"" and ""you can't allow people to steal your product and resell it""? Do you believe products of innovation should be treated the same as apples and oranges, with no such thing as IP? If so, how will we ensure that innovation remains economically viable? If it is not economically viable, how can we assure that products will be developed in the future to meet people's needs? Already we're seeing a low interest in cures and a higher interest in drugs that prolong hospital stays and addiction from pharma megacorps, which are the best equipped to quickly solve medical problems.

It's also comically easy not to.

In fact, pretty much the *only* way you *can* rack that debt up is by going to college.  There's really no other way to do it.

>  pretty much impossible for an 18-year-old to secure a $120k small business loan or land a job outside the low-wage service sector.

Which is fine for those of us who haven't gotten ourselves into six figures of debt.

Why should our smart financial decisions be punished to pay for your stupid ones?

> And accreditation quickly becomes a form of gate-keeping. Don't have a degree? What's wrong with you? Are you too stupid to make it in college? Unhireable.

You sound like someone who went straight out of high school into college without ever taking a single look at the job market.

>  Getting angry at folks who pass through this absurd system and come out the back side complaining about it is even more insane.

No, it's right.

I didn't go to college because I didn't have $120k to spend on it.,

You decided to go to college *even though* you didn't have $120k to spend on it.

You did that so you'd have an advantage over me in the job market.  But I have an advantage over you, too--I'm not $120k in debt.

You want to take away the advantage that financially smart people like me have in order to compensate for the mistakes of financially stupid people.  Wanna guess how I'll respond to that shit?",2020-02-13T19:25:54+00:00

Libertarian,comment,nursing,frubuqs,Giacamo22,,"You really, really, absolutely, under no circumstances ought to keep a people in a hospital longer than necessary. Hospitals are where critically sick people go to be treated, and the longer you’re there, the more likely you are to get some other illness. They don’t have hundreds of hermetically sealed rooms, they don’t have the staff to patient ratios to do 1 on 1 care, and the more stress you put on the nurses, the more likely they are to get infected, and even if it doesn’t kill them, they’ll be spreading it for about a week before they get tested or show symptoms, able to spread it to other patients. Also, health insurance rejects treatment costs for hospital acquired infections and the hospital has to eat the cost. 

Healthcare facilities are loathe to hire new nurses right now, because on boarding and orientation doubles their payroll for at least 2 weeks and if the nurse gets COVID 19 then it’s back to square one. So they’re largely hiring experienced TRAVEL nurses and turning to agencies for staffing. 

The States’ mandates on testing are difficult to apply to temp staff, and the current testing protocol in some states (Swab testing) is... stress inducing, with results in 5-7 days, maybe.

Libertarian,comment,nursing,i4koaz1,NPC_2256,,"Patents don’t prevent goods from hitting the free markets. Does every patented item you’ve bought from a retailer require the government to upcharge you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars? No, it doesn’t. Patents merely protect the creator in a legal and financial standpoint. The joy about the free market is that just because someone patents one thing, doesn’t mean someone can’t come along and make something entirely different, while also being better in every way. Conversely, government subsidized industries are bogged down by bureaucracy and red tape, which directly leads to a lack of competition, which directly leads to monopolization, which is what causes everyday individuals to struggle with affording their own healthcare.

The rest of your point turns into a “whataboutism” rather than being a supportive argument against privatized healthcare. Merely claiming “but what if they can’t get costs down???” Isn’t an argument because its a rhetorical question laced with fear mongering. The fact of the matter is free markets force retailers and manufacturers to figure out a way to drive down their own costs to maximize their profits, while ensuring their product is cheap enough for you to buy it over their competitions product. Flat screen TV’s used to cost THOUSANDS of dollars, and now every home can afford a flat screen TV because you can literally buy them for $200. Flat screen TV’s are literally cheaper than the tubes they replaced. The VASTLY improved product is drastically cheaper than it ever was, and that’s because we have choices through the market. Consumers should not be relegated to a just choice of chocolate or vanilla, but when the government subsidizes an industry, that’s what happens. You lose out on strawberry, pistachio, rocky road, and any other flavor you so desire, and people literally argue to keep it that way because “what about [X]” arguments linger without people educating themselves on what would actually happen if we pursued that. We’ve been stuck spiraling down the rabbit hole of financial burdens because we, as a country, are too afraid to make that change, while propaganda continues to reinforce these arguments that are based in fear, rather than fact, or even economic theory.",2022-04-13T15:09:05+00:00

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,privatization,ibn47h4,mywan,,"It can potentially reverse. Once upon a time the Republican party was built on many progressive ideals. In fact Roosevelt, a Republican, created many of the government programs and policies that the Democrats now fight for, and the Republicans fight to destroy. His policies included trust-busting, modern welfare, labor reforms, conservation, pro regulation, consumer protection, and everything the New Deal entailed. 

The New Deal Democratic coalition came later in 1932, following the Great Depression, which took Roosevelt's platform and ran with it. This coalition lasted until the late 1960s. The decline of labor unions and racial issues is primarily what did it in. It was in the 1990s that Clinton became the progenitor of the Third Way Democrats. Which took on left wing social policies combined with right leaning economic policies. This coalition of Democrats still holds the keys to power in the Democratic party. This lack of a true left wing economic policy, created largely by Roosevelt, is why you now have people claiming there's no difference between the parties.

A few ideas seem rather libertarian in nature, but then the others flipped a complete 180.

That being said, I completely agree with your points on the 1st and 4th amendment, meats, drugs (I'm more of a decriminalize over legalize stance though), and genome manipulation.

On prisons I also agree with the increased focus on rehabilitation instead of punishment, but I do think that private system if focused on rehab could do a better job than the government could. As a punishment model we currently have though, private is not working.

I am still skeptical about giving the government even more power. As we see with its violations of the 4th amendment and many other attempts (both successful and unsuccessful) to violate others individual rights, give a government an inch of power and they take a mile. 

Handing government full control of manufacturing and the economy, as well as turning the US communist is asking for corruption that is unable to be controlled. They would control your entire life, financial constraints can hinder almost anything you want to do. They would also control your medical treatments, your living facilities, all your amenities, essentially everything other than your ability to go through the process to make babies. Even then, with genome manipulation they could control that too.

Then he talks politics before sharing some dark humor with his wife that she could trade up if he’s killed. 

More politic about McConnel - most comments McConnel says he doesn’t recall having a conversation about this ever or he’s mischaracterizing it.

Sometimes he’d remember shouting “You’re the reason this is happening!” Other times, it would be something more terse: “You did this.” At least one reporter in the chamber would recount seeing the senator throw up his hands in a fit of fury as he roared, “This is what you’ve gotten, guys!” Whatever the words, the sentiment was clear: This violence, this crisis, this assault on democracy—this is your fault.”

Politics,comment,privatization,j8vchcf,mrlr,,"The article:

Fox News’s most prominent hosts and top executives agonized behind the scenes in the weeks following the 2020 election as they watched allies of Donald Trump appear on their own airwaves promoting false conspiracy theories about a stolen election, according to internal emails, text messages and depositions excerpted in a new court filing.

“Sidney Powell is lying,” Tucker Carlson wrote to a producer about the Trump lawyer, who once claimed in a guest spot that voting technology companies “flipped” Trump votes to Biden.

“Terrible stuff damaging everybody,” wrote company founder Rupert Murdoch, about wild claims raised by Powell and fellow Trump adviser, Rudy Giuliani. The recipient of his note, Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott, agreed. In another message, Murdoch referred to the claims as “really crazy stuff” and that it is “very hard to credibly claim foul everywhere.”

And of Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, Fox’s prime time roster seemed to share a common opinion during these fraught weeks.

“[He’s] acting like an insane person,” wrote Sean Hannity, star of the network’s 9 p.m. show, while his 10 p.m. colleague Laura Ingraham concurred: “Such an idiot.”

The messages are part of a cache of internal correspondence and deposition testimony released Thursday in a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against the network filed by Dominion, one of the two election software companies at the center of the conspiracy theories.

The documents provide a rare window into the inner workings of the cable news network and show how publicly Trump-friendly personalities were privately repulsed by the president’s post-election actions, with Carlson referring to Trump as a “demonic force,” according to the filings.

The filing in Delaware State Superior Court ahead of an April trial is meant to bolster Dominion’s argument that Fox leadership was aware that the claims of election fraud were untrue but nonetheless “spread and endorsed” them, the company argued.

“Not a single Fox witness testified that they believe any of the allegations about Dominion are true,” Dominion argued in the filing. “Indeed, Fox witness after Fox witness declined to assert the allegations’ truth or actually stated they do not believe them, and Fox witnesses repeatedly testified that they have not seen credible evidence to support them.”

Fox’s news staff was just as loud in raising internal concerns as the star pundits and executives, the filings show. In one message, Fox correspondent Lucas Tomlinson wrote to news anchor Bret Baier referring to “dangerously insane” election claims. Baier, in turn, wrote that “there is NO evidence of fraud” and told Bill Sammon, then the network’s Washington bureau chief, that their team must “prevent this stuff,” meaning the spread of misinformation.

In a statement, Fox News downplayed the revelations from the correspondence, saying it was filled with “cherry-picked quotes stripped of key context.”

“There will be a lot of noise and confusion generated by Dominion and their opportunistic private equity owners,” a spokesperson said, “but the core of this case remains about freedom of the press and freedom of speech, which are fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution and protected by New York Times v. Sullivan.”

In a separate counterclaim filing also made public Thursday, Fox alleged that Dominion’s $1.6 billion demand “has no factual support,” arguing that — far from having its value destroyed by Powell and Giuliani’s false claims of fraud — the company is actually “in a solid financial position.”

While much of the correspondence aired by Dominion shows Fox officials agonizing over false information on its airwaves, some of the behind-the-scenes torment was about a story the network got right — an election-night projection that Joe Biden would win the hotly contested state of Arizona.

Fox’s decision-desk analysts were days ahead of other news outlets in making the controversial call, which infuriated Trump and his supporters — including many Fox viewers.

“Do the executives understand how much credibility and trust we’ve lost with our audience?” Carlson wrote in a text message to his producer. “We’re playing with fire, for real.”

Scott, who forwarded Carlson’s concerns about the Arizona call to Fox Corp CEO and executive chairman Lachlan Murdoch, was quoted as saying that Fox’s “brand” was impacted by the “arrogance” of the early — but accurate — call.

Dominion is using such messages to make the argument that Fox was motivated by competitive pressures from smaller pro-Trump cable stations like Newsmax that threatened to lure away its viewers. Carlson, in his message, specifically warned that Newsmax “could be devastating to us.”

Fox News president Jay Wallace acknowledged in a text message to Scott that it was “a bit troubling” to see Newsmax pick up Fox viewers — an ultimately short-lived gain — adding that the rival network offered “an alternate universe” but that “it can’t be ignored.”

Newsmax “should be watched, if skeptically,” Rupert Murdoch told Scott in a Nov. 16, 2020 email, adding that he doesn’t “want to antagonize Trump further.”

And Scott and Lachlan Murdoch commiserated over how their pro-Trump viewers were “going through the 5 stages of grief,” as Scott put it, promising her corporate boss that Fox would “plant flags letting the viewers know we hear them and respect them.” Her boss agreed that a “constant rebuilding without any missteps” was needed after the Arizona call.

“We can fix this,” Scott wrote, “but we cannot smirk at our viewers any longer.”

Dominion’s filings also suggest that Fox brass bristled when its own reporters attempted to push back on election conspiracies on the air. “If this gets picked up, viewers are going to be further disgusted,” Scott wrote in a message after reporter Jacqui Heinrich fact-checked a Trump tweet containing misinformation about Dominion. In a text message, Carlson suggested to Hannity that Heinrich should be fired. Kristen Fisher, then a White House reporter for Fox who has since moved to CNN, testified that her then-boss told her higher-ups were “unhappy” with her own fact-checking segment.

In Fox’s own brief requesting the judge rule in its favor, attorneys argue that Fox showed no “actual malice” — the high standard required in defamation cases — because all of the hosts who allowed false claims to be aired honestly believed there was a chance the election might have been stolen using Dominion’s machines.

“It is hardly unusual that some people in a newsroom (with the diverse political viewpoints one would expect) will disbelieve the allegations and hope that they ultimately prove false,” Fox’s lawyers wrote, “while others will keep an open mind in hopes that they prove true.”

But Hannity, for one, said in a deposition quoted in the Dominion filing that he never believed Powell’s claims. “Nobody ever convinced me that their argument was anywhere near accurate or true.”",2023-02-17T05:14:23+00:00

Healthcare,comment,privatized,eu4997f,scottyboy218,,"Yes, they are very likely referring to the premium split, so the 25% is the piece of the premium she's paying out of her paycheck.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately a deductible of $2,000 - $3,000 isn't that uncommon these days, and hardly qualifies as cruddy.  If the employer is picking up 75%, I can almost guarantee she'd be paying significantly more for a significantly worse plan on the marketplace.

&#x200B;

Her employer is required to provide her with SBCs (Summary of Benefits and Coverage).  If her employer won't provide it, the insurance company absolutely will.

&#x200B;

Make sure she pushes to get what she needs in terms of plan options/plan costs - most employers have a 31 day window to enroll in benefits as a new hire.  If she misses it, she's out of lucky until the next open enrollment.

&#x200B;

As an aside, benefits are a huge part of the total compensation package.  The purpose of offering benefits is to attract and retain employees.  Any future job hunting/job movement, it's always good to do your diligence and ask them for a copy of their benefits guide/payroll contributions.  You can easily get a $10k salary bump but lose 15k in benefit offerings without knowing.

Governments provide no net benefit to society - they are parasitical and by an measure are destructive to society. Any services that are monopolized by government that have any value will be replaced by the free market.
2. Monopolies dont exist under a free market, they are only enabled through government intervention, ""laws"" the government employs generally do more damage then any good.
3. The government should not steal from people to enrich others, this is equivalent to corporate subsidies. All gov subsidies are a misalloacation of capital and distort the markets. If history shows anything from gov subsidies, it only makes things more expensive, example: housing, school, healthcare, etc. Anything of worth to humanity will stand on its own in a free market without government meddling, this includes medical care and environmentalism.

The most important changes are:

  
\- Elimination of the rent control law.

\- Elimination of the supermarket law that regulated how supermarkets could place and distribute products in their shelves.

\- Elimination of the ""Ley de Abastecimiento"" that allowed the government to intervene in domestic markets and set price ceilings.

\- Elimination of the ""Buy Argentine"" law that incentivized the government to buy domestically produced goods.

\- Elimination of the price control department of the Ministry of the Economy.

\- Elimination of the Industrial Promotion and the Commercial Promotion laws, which implemented all sorts of distortionary subsidies, incentives, and regulations, particularly for domestically produced goods.

\- Elimination of the regulation that prevented the privatization of state companies.

\- Elimination of the current regulatory structure underpinning state companies.

\- Transformation of all state companies into ""Sociedades Anonimas"" (e.g.  think LLCs) in preparation of their subsequent privatization.

\- Modernization and deregulation of labor and employment laws to reduce unemployment.

\- Reform of the Customs Code to deregulate and facilitate international commerce, imports, and exports.

\- Elimination of  the ""Ley de Tierras"" which limited the amount and ways in which foreigners could own land in Argentina.

\- Modifications to the ""Ley de Manejo del Fuego"".

\- General deregulation of the sugar industry, and of sugar imports.

\- General deregulation of the mining industry.

\- Preparations to privatize Aerolineas Argentinas, the state-owned airline.

\- Deregulation of the airline industry to allow in foreign companies (""Cielos abiertos"") and promote competition.

\- Modifications to the Civil Code to reinforce contractual freedom.

\- Deregulation of the health insurance industry and union healthcare firms (obras sociales). Digital prescriptions now have legal validity equivalent to that of paper prescriptions.

\- Elimination of all price controls in the health insurance industry.

\-  Deregulation of pharmacies (elimination of laws and regulations similar to ""Certificate of Need"" laws in the US that hinder competition and free entry of competitors).

\- Modifications to the ""Ley de Sociedades Anonimas"" to allow football clubs to become private corporations if they wish to.

\- Deregulation of internet satellite services (e.g. Starlink. Before the decree services such as Starlink were basically prohibited).

\- Deregulation of the tourism industry, elimination of tourism agencies' monopolies.

\- Digitalization of car registries, patenting, etc.",2023-12-21T04:32:33+00:00

Who of the Republican candidates is most qualified to replace him? Who will win?,"Seeing as how it's the Utah 3rd district we're talking about, whoever wins the Republican primary will win the general.  There are three candidates: John Curtis, Tanner Ainge, and Chris Herrod.

John Curtis is the current mayor of Provo, the state's third largest city.  He enjoys a 94% approval rating after eight years.  Though he is a Republican now, he once ran as a Utah Democrat and served as the chair of the Utah Democratic party 20 years ago.  He is a self described conservative with a moderate approach to governance, expressing his willingness to work across the aisle on various issues.  He did not vote for Donald Trump and is endorsed by 22 Utah mayors, the local newspaper, and Gary Herbert, the state's governor.  Curtis secured his spot on the ballot by collecting 7000 Republican signatures.

Tanner Ainge is a private equity businessman who also happens to be the son of Danny Ainge, current Boston Celtics general manager and BYU basketball legend.  Tanner Ainge has lived in Utah at various periods of his life, but has only been a registered Utah voter for the past seven months.  He describes himself as a strong conservative who believes in robust social safety nets.  He is endorsed by a handful of local legislators.  Tanner Ainge also secured his spot on the ballot by collecting 7000 signatures.

Chris Herrod is a former Utah state legislator.  He describes himself as a platform Republican and constitutionalist.  He ran the Ted Cruz campaign in Utah and is endorsed by Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and several local legistlators.  Herrod secured his spot on the ballot by being selected at the GOP state convention by the delegates.

Financial reports show that most of Curtis's money comes from Utahns, while the majority of Ainge and Herrod's money comes form outside the state.

Accountability for journalism and media. Make it as easy as possible to sue the pants off media outlets who knowingly spread misinformation.

Any criticism of the press is an attempt at undermining the press. When liberals criticize Fox News as conservative propaganda, they're attempting to undermine Fox News. When Trump criticizes CNN as fake news, he's attempting to undermine CNN.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,privatized,kzca3pv,heresmytwopence,,"With regard to student loans, the reasoning behind making them nondischargeable in bankruptcy has been dubious ever since those measures began in the mid-1970s. GAO studies back then found that only 0.75% of student debt was being discharged in bankruptcy, hardly the epidemic that politicians claimed it was. Further, those discharges weren’t being sought by high-earners as was also claimed. The largest percentages were teachers, “clerks” (presumably retail workers?), salespeople, homemakers and students. 

As for BAPCPA, studies actually found slight *decreases* in private student loan availability to borrowers with lower FICO scores post-BAPCPA, disproving one of the supposed upsides of extending presumptive nondischargeability to private student loans.

In short, it’s a gimme to corporate interests and deserves a shameful legacy. It should also come as no surprise that Lindsey Graham — architect of the forgivable PPP loan — led the charge for BAPCPA for years before its final passage under GWB. Clinton vetoed an earlier iteration of it in 2000.

Unfortunately a deductible of $2,000 - $3,000 isn't that uncommon these days, and hardly qualifies as cruddy.  If the employer is picking up 75%, I can almost guarantee she'd be paying significantly more for a significantly worse plan on the marketplace.

&#x200B;

Her employer is required to provide her with SBCs (Summary of Benefits and Coverage).  If her employer won't provide it, the insurance company absolutely will.

&#x200B;

Make sure she pushes to get what she needs in terms of plan options/plan costs - most employers have a 31 day window to enroll in benefits as a new hire.  If she misses it, she's out of lucky until the next open enrollment.

&#x200B;

As an aside, benefits are a huge part of the total compensation package.  The purpose of offering benefits is to attract and retain employees.  Any future job hunting/job movement, it's always good to do your diligence and ask them for a copy of their benefits guide/payroll contributions.  You can easily get a $10k salary bump but lose 15k in benefit offerings without knowing.

PoliticalDiscussion,post,privatizing,6qlvdb,reluctantclinton,The Utah 3rd District is in the middle of a special election primary to replace Jason Chaffetz. Who of the Republican candidates is most qualified to replace him? Who will win?,"Seeing as how it's the Utah 3rd district we're talking about, whoever wins the Republican primary will win the general.  There are three candidates: John Curtis, Tanner Ainge, and Chris Herrod.

John Curtis is the current mayor of Provo, the state's third largest city.  He enjoys a 94% approval rating after eight years.  Though he is a Republican now, he once ran as a Utah Democrat and served as the chair of the Utah Democratic party 20 years ago.  He is a self described conservative with a moderate approach to governance, expressing his willingness to work across the aisle on various issues.  He did not vote for Donald Trump and is endorsed by 22 Utah mayors, the local newspaper, and Gary Herbert, the state's governor.  Curtis secured his spot on the ballot by collecting 7000 Republican signatures.

Tanner Ainge is a private equity businessman who also happens to be the son of Danny Ainge, current Boston Celtics general manager and BYU basketball legend.  Tanner Ainge has lived in Utah at various periods of his life, but has only been a registered Utah voter for the past seven months.  He describes himself as a strong conservative who believes in robust social safety nets.  He is endorsed by a handful of local legislators.  Tanner Ainge also secured his spot on the ballot by collecting 7000 signatures.

Chris Herrod is a former Utah state legislator.  He describes himself as a platform Republican and constitutionalist.  He ran the Ted Cruz campaign in Utah and is endorsed by Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and several local legistlators.  Herrod secured his spot on the ballot by being selected at the GOP state convention by the delegates.

Financial reports show that most of Curtis's money comes from Utahns, while the majority of Ainge and Herrod's money comes form outside the state.

Current polls show Curtis leading the race by a large margin, with many undecided voters.

The police wanted to find some child porn, but they had no probable cause in Florida, just speculation. But they could procure an excuse to look for drugs at the house. So they did a warrant on drugs and found the photos, and then based on the RS article, they got another warrant for another search on child porn.

This could be said of essentially everything that they do so far, from the fact that they lied about their numbers on Inauguration Day, to the fact that every time Trump opens his mouth after a major news event drops, [he shoots apart any explanation](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2017/05/11/comey/a2R6OIsRavOwRZmDBDuGgO/story.html) his surrogates try to put together.

I think a lot of this comes from a misunderstanding of exactly how political theater in this country is supposed to work, and that the current administration feels that it can extend the fiction of how things normally work into new fields without suffering push back. There's a reason that politicians use dog-whistles instead of directly and bluntly stating the thornier sides of their beliefs.",2017-05-20T23:38:56+00:00

Break up the media monopolies, full stop. 

Accountability for journalism and media. Make it as easy as possible to sue the pants off media outlets who knowingly spread misinformation. Zero tolerance, full accountability so that Fox, CNN, and online “news” companies are terrified of lying to the people. Fine social media companies for knowingly allowing misinformation on their platforms.

Don’t allow news media (TV, radio, internet, etc) to also have “entertainment” shows, segments, articles, etc.. I don’t know how to differentiate editorials from entertainment, but I needs to happen.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,privatizing,e05p1zf,teddilicious,,"\> And the continued success of the media *in some demographics* isn't evidence of anything. 

I never mentioned the ""success"" of the press. My point is that the press has continued to report on stories as it sees fit. CNN hasn't buckled, nor is there any reason to believe it will, despite scathing criticism from Trump. If anything, the criticism has emboldened the press.  Surely you must understand at least that? 

\> Where does criticism end, and undermining begin? 

Any criticism of the press is an attempt at undermining the press. When liberals criticize Fox News as conservative propaganda, they're attempting to undermine Fox News. When Trump criticizes CNN as fake news, he's attempting to undermine CNN.

\> By your definition any attempt at censorship that isn't obviously successful isn't censorship

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,privatizing,kzca3pv,heresmytwopence,,"With regard to student loans, the reasoning behind making them nondischargeable in bankruptcy has been dubious ever since those measures began in the mid-1970s. GAO studies back then found that only 0.75% of student debt was being discharged in bankruptcy, hardly the epidemic that politicians claimed it was. Further, those discharges weren’t being sought by high-earners as was also claimed. The largest percentages were teachers, “clerks” (presumably retail workers?), salespeople, homemakers and students. 

As for BAPCPA, studies actually found slight *decreases* in private student loan availability to borrowers with lower FICO scores post-BAPCPA, disproving one of the supposed upsides of extending presumptive nondischargeability to private student loans.

In short, it’s a gimme to corporate interests and deserves a shameful legacy. It should also come as no surprise that Lindsey Graham — architect of the forgivable PPP loan — led the charge for BAPCPA for years before its final passage under GWB. Clinton vetoed an earlier iteration of it in 2000.

If that is so, he is a looser as Trump and his Republican sycophants and their brainwashed base practise 'lies, hypocrisy and the supression of democracy', a far more powerful force than Kryptonite. 

The only power Superman still possessed was the ability to recognize the Emperor wore no clothes and, as with Lois Lane's underwear, observed that the color of Trump's diapers that he claimed for decades had always been red, had originally been blue, until he switched to red because he saw a greater possibility of 'conning' those of that political persuasion.

No surprise, therefore, as covid flight concerns eased, the 'Man of Steel' booked an 'Ascention Air' flight to Krypton to consult with Dad, complaining that given the fascist ideals of the GOP, the concept of 'Truth, Justice and the American Way' had become just a delusional dream!

Dad, however, appears to be convincing Superman to give it one more try for the Gipper by returning to earth, on yet one more Friday the 13th. that his Q'anon followers have proclaimed will be Trump's triumphant return to the White House. There, in front of all Republican evangelical apostles, he will wash Donald's feet, thereby revealing the true Judas. Trump will immediately flee to the Garden of Mar-A-Lago where he will commit suicide fully expecting to rise from the dead several days later on July 4th. - only to be dumbfounded (an infliction he has suffered from throughout his life) when he fails to move the rock aside.

As a result, true devotees such as Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Lindsey Graham, Greg Abbot, Ron Johnson, etc. etc. will flee to join the Taliban where women are expected to know their place.

One problem we have, and this has occurred in the past half-century, or so; is that we have stopped looking at some ""expenditures"" as ""investments""; hired people based on criteria other than competency; and ""looked the other way"", when some workers and officers, accepted bribes, and ""dipped into the""till"" themselves, or allowed others to do so.  This is basically the definition of corruption.

Another problem is that many welfare programs have eligibility requirements in place that hinder, or prevent, a person from saving up to buy a house. For example, to qualify for food stamps you can't have more than $2,250 in savings.

For Section 8 programs, any income on assets is included in your income. 

>Example: Jim holds a Section 8 voucher and pays $150 each month in rent. Last year, his mother passed away and bequeathed him $3500 in stocks. From these stocks, he earned a $360 end-of-year dividend (equal to $30 per month). Jim will now have to pay an additional $10 per month toward rent.[source](http://www.canhr.org/publications/newsletters/NetNews/Feature_Article/NN_2004Q4.html)

So the more you save or invest, the higher your rent gets. The increase in rent is still less than the increase in income, but it does make saving up to buy a house harder.

No reforms proposed by republicans deal with the impediments in place that hinder people's ability to save or invest money.

Several Republican lawmakers have gotten behind a GOP resolution declaring support for IVF, while one even signed onto a Democratic bill to create federal protections for fertility services.

At issue is the the VA's announcement last week that it will provide IVF services to unmarried veterans and those in same-sex marriages, as well as those who cannot create their own sperm or eggs.

Four Freedom Caucus members, led by Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.), wrote in a letter to VA Secretary Denis McDonough that they have ""strong objections"" to the new policy.

""IVF is morally dubious and should not be subsidized by the American taxpayer,"" they continued, echoing opposition from anti-abortion groups to the creation of ""surplus"" embryos as part of the IVF process. The letter includes a list of questions for McDonough about the storage and treatment of surplus embryos and the cost and legality of the policy.

In addition to Rosendale, the letter was signed by Reps. Mary Miller (R-Ill.), Josh Brecheen (R-Okla.) and Bob Good (R-Va.), the chair of the Freedom Caucus.

The lawmakers wrote that it would ""make more sense"" to use the funds for the IVF policy tot ""bolster adoption efforts"" instead.

A VA spokesperson told Axios that, by law, the department's policy must adhere to that of the Pentagon, which similarly expanded IVF access. The spokesperson added that the VA only covers the freezing of embryos but does not destroy them. In the event of divorce or death. Disposal is a choice for the veteran or their family.

Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.), who introduced the Democratic bill to create federal protections for IVF, told Axios of the letter, simply, ""Unbelievable.""",2024-03-21T00:49:07+00:00

We can't verify the veracity of academic/exam records from e.g. China, the way we can with records. I do business in China. The entire place is corrupt and runs on bribes -top to bottom. When a tycoon or party official wants to send their dingleberry kid to a US college, they make it happen and (unlike domestic students) it can never catch up to them.

The result is unqualified international students in difficult degree programs forming *huge* WeChat cheating rings. In my graduate CS courses the international students couldn't even get Hello World to compile. My friends who went on to teach at University say that the problem has only gotten worse in the decades since, but they're not allowed to address it. 

There are also instances of US college admissions staff getting busted for accepting bribes to let hundreds of unqualified Chinese international students through the admissions interviews.

What do you think would happen if we just took US students at their word about their grades and test scores? People follow their incentives, and when you create perverse incentives you get degenerate results.

At least in the rare instance when a domestic admissions bribery ring is discovered we weren't educating somebody who was going to ply their skills for the CCP. We can actually discover that fake domestic records are fake. College professors can take action against those students for cheating or just generally being awful. We can put people in jail.

Not really for a few reasons, but these are good questions.

1. Not all loans will be repaid.  Making a loan is a risk, and the risk is that the money will not be returned.  For some amount of borrowers, that will be true.
2. Inflation.  Money is worth less each year.  On a good year, it's worth 2-3% less than the previous year.  On a bad year (2022), it can be worth 8% less.  So while the nominal amount is returned, the value of that amount is a loss.
3. Opportunity cost.  Everytime you spend money on one thing, you don't spend it on something else.  If I buy $100 in cigars each month instead of putting my money in an IRA, then the true cost is not only the $100 but also the amount I could have earned by putting it the IRA.

Really student loans are a solid bargain for borrowers.  When you factor in low inflation rates, the real return on a loan to the federal government is closer to 3%.  That's enough to offset some of the risk and some of the opprontuinity cost, but is still much lower than the market would bear.",2024-02-25T04:24:07+00:00

* Funding for applications-based research already vastly outweighs fundamental research. Research grants aren't just distributed like candy; they are awarded competitively, and technological or societal benefits are weighted very strongly in selecting winners. University professors commonly spend half their time writing proposals to justify the research they are pursuing.

* At a basic level, however, there is an argument to be made that government funded research should not be *too* directly useful. Private corporations are already motivated to fund directly-applied research, so those project don't need as much aid from the government. On the other hand, government aid is crucial for ""long shot"" research programs that could provide unimagined benefits but have no immediate or certain payback.

It actually is. It's in an account at the treasury.

edit: i actually thing everyone else is working on the wrong side of the ledger. look at how actual insurance companies treat obligations and prepayments (premiums). They don't hit the income statement immediately in the form of revenues. That will just bloat the revenues in the current year and won't match up when you actually earn them. 

How does one earn these revenues? Wait until the obligation is gone and keep any remaining money you haven't paid out to the person you owed the obligation to. For Social Security essentially, the person dies before they collect what they paid in. That's when you can recognize the revenue. You can't recognize revenue before that because you don't know if they will live longer and take more than they paid in. If they take more than they paid it, not only will you not have ANY revenue, you will have an expenditure! 

These accounting gimmicks that the US is using for the government budget are similar to the accounting gimmicks that Enron used. When do you recognize money someone has paid/ prepaid you as revenue? ",2012-12-08T01:10:39+00:00

Several Republican lawmakers have gotten behind a GOP resolution declaring support for IVF, while one even signed onto a Democratic bill to create federal protections for fertility services.

At issue is the the VA's announcement last week that it will provide IVF services to unmarried veterans and those in same-sex marriages, as well as those who cannot create their own sperm or eggs.

Four Freedom Caucus members, led by Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.), wrote in a letter to VA Secretary Denis McDonough that they have ""strong objections"" to the new policy.

""IVF is morally dubious and should not be subsidized by the American taxpayer,"" they continued, echoing opposition from anti-abortion groups to the creation of ""surplus"" embryos as part of the IVF process. The letter includes a list of questions for McDonough about the storage and treatment of surplus embryos and the cost and legality of the policy.

Conservative,comment,universal healthcare,cikfbjg,Sev22,,"No one is saying the government can do anything. The arguments in this thread just boil down to nationalized healthcare as a more efficient means of healthcare in a nation. The argument above by /u/threerocks makes a compelling argument for a more socialized approach to medicine that is both cost-efficient and more effective. 

Does a nationalized healthcare system mean more government intervention? Yes, in some regards. For example, in Taiwan (a nation whose administrative costs for healthcare are the lowest in the world), patients have a sort of ""credit card"" of their entire medical history, ailments, procedures, etc. It is a very efficient means of information technology, but it also gives government and agencies unfettered access to personal medical history. That might be a bit too far for the average American (then again, the NSA has gone unhindered, so I wonder...) 

In any case, the argument for nationalized healthcare is certainly compelling, and the U.S. (I believe) should make more strides towards reaching that. Every developed country in the world has maintained a health system that beats the U.S. is almost every regard. ",2014-06-30T00:15:15+00:00

So, universal healthcare is a tricky sell to the people who have already made up their minds about it. We pretty much have a wall between both opposing sides on every issue and it's grown over the course of the crazy bickering. At this point, if you want to change your belief, you have to climb the huge fucking wall right in front of all the friends and family who you have been ideologically hanging out with, and they'll pull every manipulative cult tactic to get you to come back down. If you manage to make it just to the top of the wall to try and get a better view, let alone going completely over, you become a pariah of the group you just left and your reputation with them becomes drastically tarnished. I never grow tired of being called a hippie or librul or progressive or Russian, but I have no idea how either lunatic group is still managing to not burn out.

That's become the norm for political discourse here. So far, more people are watching and participating and its turning out wonderfully - especially for me since I feel like I've been fighting either alone or in the dark and I'm worn the hell out, but maybe some elements of the cavalry have arrived.

Quite the opposite, the church instructs its members to take government aid (and thus deplete already scarce welfare budgets) *before* going to the church for help.

For its own members, and for its own members *only*.

5.	understanding that markets fail (externalities, delayed feedback)
6.	utilitarianism and no one left behind (human rights, welfare state for the poor and the unlucky)

Welfare generosity, there are all kinds of benefits you can get if you need them, and they only stretch as far as purchasing power does, which dorks like Jacobin readers don't have any real answers for.  

They'd make it harder to run any businesses and folks of their ilk routinely attacking building more housing on NIMBY grounds, then are all surprised pikachu when shit gets worse.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,welfare,gvznse0,bellicae,,"It is the case that direct taxes were originally prohibited from the Federal Government by Article 1, Section 9, clause 4, ""No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.""

As I understand, this meant income tax was illegal, except when absolutely necessary to finance the overcoming of a huge crisis, as seen during the Civil War. The 16th Amendment changed that clause to allow income tax.

I would define primary industry as anything that is taken directly from the earth through drilling or mining. Secondary industry  could be defined as all revenue generated by selling to companies rather than individual consumers (this could be hard to gauge in the case of a small shop, owned by a single person, providing retail, street food, or some other low barrier product, that could intermingle with general consumer sales of the companies that sell large quantities of the types of things those shop keepers use). Consumer Industry could mean anything that is sold as an end product to a consumer, i.e. fast food, clothes, computers, etc.

It is my estimation that this would provide the Federal Government with enough to satisfy its necessary tasks (keeping things like money and certain regulations uniform, and, of course, providing a military and embassies in foreign countries). The most revenue would go to small governments, which could fund things like hospitals, schools, universities, roads, etc. in better detail than the Feds could ever hope. It would also keep most corruption contained to the local sphere, rather than infect the entire nation with bad spending (take a quick look at how much the Feds spend on Healthcare, and how few people get healthcare to get a good view of that level of corruption).",2021-04-26T23:31:56+00:00

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,welfare,czd5k62,ghastly1302,,"> The state is really just the administrative wing of the society at large.

This is a delusion - one which the state would like you to believe in. All states are created using violence and sustained using violence. The state always serves the ruling class. Your theory of government seems to be - brigands control us,but this slavery is only ""legitimate"" if they listen to us from time to time. You cannot opt out of the state,the state is a compulsory association. To quote Max Stirner,""the state calls it's violence law,and that of the individual crime"".

> In a democracy, the final word on how to utilize public resources ultimately lies with the citizens themselves, and they can always overrule the administrators through the democratic process. If it was truly the ""private property of the state"" then this wouldn't be the case.

Yes,yes,and in fascism,the ruler is not actually a dictator because fascism is really organic democracy - the ruler always listens to the people! Seriously,this is what fascists think.
Your claim is false,because the state's word is always the final word. Look at history and read the news. You somehow think the rulers are saints - always acting in the interest of the people.

Probably because the heritage foundation, a right-wing think tank, wants to claim that the US has gotten ""less economically free"" under Obama so they're fudging the numbers.   ",2016-02-01T03:42:45+00:00
