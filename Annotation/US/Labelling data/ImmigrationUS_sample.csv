Neoliberal,comment,Visa,hzgkyxt,WantDebianThanks,,"Update from my job doing content moderation for a social media company:

People continue to decide that an illegal war of aggression in which war crimes keep happening, civilians keep being murdered and gangraped, and civilian infrastructure is being shelled for no reason is the perfect opportunity to take out their irrelevant and often petty squabbles! Ukraine didn't vote to sanction your regional rival for building nuclear weapons (which I'm pretty sure would have been in the 70's or 80's, btw), guess should post memes demanding our government adamantly support Russia! Russia never started any wars in your country but the west did? [Better make sure to post memes about how this is all NATO's fault!](https://imgur.com/ii0J6jI) Hate American military activity in the middle east? Better post about how Obama is personally responsible for a million Syrian deaths so a few thousand Ukrainian deaths isn't anything to worry about (pretty sure there haven't been a million deaths in the Syrian Civil War, that Russia a combatant, and that *Syrians have agency in that war*). Haven't paid any attention to what's going on and want to blame America because it's clearly the only country with any agency? Well, *obviously* the whole war is because America has forced itself onto Ukraine and refused to negotiate with Russia! There have been reports of racial minorities being discriminated against while trying to flee? Guess it's a good thing the Russia's are in Ukraine to de-nazify it then! Want to talk about western hypocrasy? OK, then let's just mention a few wars the US has been involved in the last few decades and ignore any context so that that list can include Korea and Serbia. Also, as the Serbians will be happy to tell you, all Americans are colonialist, genocidal war criminals, so anyone they don't like must be doing a good thing, therefore, kill all of the Ukrainians.

And no matter what, make sure to include about Zelenskyy is the single most corrupt and incompetent human being ever, that this is his fault, and that he is destroying Ukraine

And this isn't even touching on all of the pieces of shit unironically circulating ""Ukraine is a nazi regime"", over the top antisemitism, or westerners who are incapable of criticizing Russia without *also* criticizing America/the West/Capitalism.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,naturalization,hckpmhj,bronzeaardvark,,"Whether or not this was a subtle condemnation of the incident at the Capital (even the FBI doesn't consider it an insurrection), my biggest issue is the difficulty of finding domestic terrorists. A strategy that helps ""expose"" these terrorists is basically to get someone to rile their online forum up, collect evidence, and stand them in front of a judge and talk about how they saved the country from another 9/11. Which begs the question, are they stopping terrorism or making it?

If we look specifically at the events that started in the summer of 2020 to the present I notice in the comment section that there is an exclusive concern that the far right will be the source of domestic terrorism. I don't remember seeing the proud boys/Qanon/etc burning down small businesses, shooting someone who doesn't share their political beliefs, and launching fireworks at liberal rallies in DC. In fact I can't remember any time where the right went out to disrupt left-leaning political rally. It's not like these attacks are coming from one side of the political spectrum.

Should be we concerned about domestic terrorism from the far right like white nationalists and QAnon? Absolutely. Is the threat of domestic terrorist mostly from the far right? I'd have to disagree. Even though these sources are coming from the FBI I'm willing to bet they're using methods exactly or similar to what I typed in the first paragraph to make that conclusion and they could be exclusively monitoring these groups as well. If they went out and targeted groups like Antifa they'd probably get similar results.",2021-09-12T15:53:33+00:00,t3_pmgr93

Liberal,comment,naturalization,ekskzit,mjhrobson,,"Your problem is you think information changes minds. I assure you it does no such thing...

Consider the shift in mainstream shifts in views on homosexual marriages. The facts of the matter haven't changed over the years what changed is people coming out. Now when most people think of gay marriage they actually have a narrative in place. It is no longer no body that they are stopping from getting married, it is Peted and Jim from down the street and those guys are bad guys my kids can go swim in their pool? They obviously should be allowed to get married. What shifted mainstream opinion on homosexual marriages was that sort of thing, it was actually meeting gay people having dinner with them and doing normal day to day stuff around/with them.

The thing is if I had stayed within the Catholic community I would have probably found a partner (a wife whom I love). Now I have some people on the internet calling me sexist, what do you think I do? I would go to my wife and asked her ""babe I am sexist?"" Now she is a Catholic or similar, she says to me ""No don't be silly"" (or something similar). This then tells me everything I need to know about your information. It will do NOTHING.

As with shifts in views on homosexuality people need a story to attach their views to. You want to change minds there is ONE way... inviting people to do everyday things with you. As what happened in the feminist reading group to me. Here I see not ""femi-nazi harpies"" or whatever negative slur you think, but I see Lisa, Julie, Kathy my friends who are human beings.

This is why early movements in feminism used mothers, sisters and daughters in the rhetoric around the activism. Do I hate my sister, do I think my daughter shouldn't have the right to vote. Is my mother stupid, etc... and that narrative was ultimately undeniable with respect to getting the vote. Of course my sister should be allowed to vote. I have a daughter, of course she should get a good education. But the sad reality is you have present information as inviting narratives. Without that you're not changing minds more than they have been.

Most people are going, but women have the right to vote. A rich white dude thinks about his daughter studying to be a doctor (or something)...You cannot tell him with information he is sexist. He does not see how that could be. You have to give him a narrative he understands involving people he identifies with. This is how people are.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Immigration,jhycvjk,app_priori,,"Within the context of the US at least, liberal has increasingly become a catch-all designation for centrists, the center-left, actual liberals, progressives, and Communists. This is because modern conservatism as we know it in the United States has increasingly become reactionary populism where politicians have decided to harness anger to win elections, not drive good policy.

A decade ago, when the Tea Party was more influential and influenced by big business conservatives who want low taxes and low regulation you could argue that there was some rationale for some of the things they championed for. But the big business conservatives gradually lost control of these conservative activists, who have increasingly become anti-intellectual and reactionary. There is no longer any attempt to create coherent policies, it's all about grievances. And many conservative politicians began to realize that they don't need policies anymore, they just need to feed anger and outrage to their primary base to continue being elected. 

I don't see things changing. The system and its incentives have become too deeply rooted in our political culture for anything to change. And there is reason to believe that conservative politicians will grow even more reactionary to maintain their power.",2023-04-27T18:50:45+00:00,t3_130tzcu

Healthcare,comment,Visa,dzck8v5,corrado33,,"This is funny. You've fallen into every single one of the ""I'm losing the argument"" tropes.

You've started attacking me, ignoring any actual arguments I've made, and have come up with multiple strawmen so that you can ""win"" your own arguments.

It's really funny to watch this happen. Let me do the honorable thing and respond, directly, to your ""arguments."" I only ask you to show me the same courtesy.

1. This is a non argument. Were you trying to make a point? Are you trying to get me to feel sympathy for some of the best paid people in the country? Physicans make a crap ton of money and they can easily pay off their student loans. I can guarantee you that.
2. An attack on me, how original. Even though insurance is the currency of the market of healthcare, it is somehow... external to that market? Can you better explain this? Yes, the healthcare market IS changing fundamentally. Ask your local doctor about their insurance premiums over the last decade, ask them if their practices have changed because of healthcare. Personally, I think it's extraordinarily naive to assume the healthcare market is EVER static. 
3. The US military protects the world from.... what exactly? When's the last time an external threat has hurt the US? Go ahead and ask the people of the occupied countries if they want the US to be there. Isn't the UN the actual ""world police?"" Is that not what it was made for? 
4. Let's take a quote from the declaration of independence. ""We hold these truths to be sacred & undeniable; that all men are created equal & independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent & inalienable, among which are the preservation of life, & liberty, & the pursuit of happiness"" Does healthcare not fall under the ""preservation of life"" and/or ""the pursuit of happiness"" clause of that statement? The US is one of an ever shrinking list of countries that does not have socialized healthcare. Most of AFRICA has socialized healthcare. Just pointing that out. Funnily enough, I know exactly of this ""grueling"" process of schooling. For, you see, I am a doctor. Not a medical doctor, but a PhD. 
5. So you want to get rid of insurance companies. Great! What's your solution for providing healthcare to those who can't afford it then? What of those who are extraordinarily sick? Those with cancer? What of those who only get insurance through their job and otherwise wouldn't be able to afford it? That's great, we agree on getting rid of insurance companies. I, however, have thought past that and moved onto a better solution. Have you? What, exactly, IS your solution? Pay cash for everything? Because you haven't actually stated it, and have left me to make assumptions, which you are likely going to attack me for next. 
6. I never said it would be cheaper for the US to adopt a similar system. I'm not sure why this is an argument. But I suppose I should respond in kind. The number of people living in the US who do not have health insurance is around 10%, down from 16% since Obamacare was in acted. That's ~30 million people. And that doesn't even include elderly people.

So please. If you're done attacking me, please pay me a courtesy and actually respond to my arguments. I'll ask this again....

You said your daughter went to the ER in Germany. Did she get treated well? Did she have any issues? Did she end up with a large bill? Was the process stressful for her other than the actual injury/illness? Now, if you could, for 10 seconds, put yourself in someone else's shoes. The parent of a German girl who is visiting the US. Imagine the same thing happened to her, how do you think it would have been different? How would you have felt then about the US healthcare system? Funnily enough, I know how this story ends. I'm friends with a foreign girl in the US who needed surgery and found it cheaper to fly home across the Atlantic, get the procedure done, then fly back a month later after she had recovered.

That's not a ""strawman"", nor is it an excuse for you to point out when the other side also does not account for it.

The bottom line remains that you cannot conclude - which you insist to do anyways - either that it is, or that it is not local/global, when you simply don't seem to have anything to back it up. 

You are therefore simply cherry picking.

Perhaps, since you are so invested in honoring the OP (i.e. me) with a thoughtful response, you might have actually read the article I posted about the D-O events (i.e. this one, specifically the ""causes"" section [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dansgaard%E2%80%93Oeschger\_event#Causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dansgaard%E2%80%93Oeschger_event#Causes) )

This clearly explains that there is no reason to assume it to be global and evidence points rather strongly towards local.

Perhaps you could also be bothered to actually look at any serious investigation into whether the definitely \*local\* data you keep flaunting with regards to whether its trends are just local or indeed global, as such investigation surely exists somewhere beyond the narrow confines of the highly particular image files you are exposing us to.",2022-06-15T15:33:33+00:00,t1_icgjfny

Neoliberal,post,citizenship,j7i66k,FrancisReed,"Why America is sliding into authoritarianism, and what you can do about it","This is not a tale of Democracy and Dictatorship, but of three political systems:

1) Monarchy, where one person holds all power (includes traditional unipersonal dictatorship)

2) Aristocracy, where a group of similar-minded persons hold power, whether it be a social class (Nobility) or a collegiate body (Military Dictatorship or One-Party State).

Unity is what defines them and makes it closer to (1).

3) Republic, where a group of people with different beliefs hassle power between each other.

The checks and balances have the only purpose of keeping one person or group from taking too much power, lest it devolves into (1) or (2).

The Republican system works fine as long as there is a political culture that's willing to compromise, putting country over party. It hangs on a thin thread: The choices of the politicans.

After the end of the Soviet Union, America had no longer any foreign threat against which to unite. It was only a matter of time until, like Rome, it too turned against itself.

It was Newt Gringrich who inaugurated a new culture of making politics, with no compromise.

This form of making politics is great for taking power... because it CRASHES the Republican system.

It makes government useless and forces it to devolve into (2) or (1) just to become functional again. It's equivalent to taking the citizenship hostage.

The libertarian outlook of the GOP made them believe that a useless government was a good thing.

They were blinded to how necessary is an efficient government for a modern society, and not even the pandemic has awakened them.

Now, the rise of China is convincing many nations across the developing world that (1) and (2) are better models for development.

But it's not the models that are broken, is the people.

It was the Republicans who attempted against the republic.

But they couldn't have succeded if the Democrats weren't discredited in the eyes of many.

Since the current leaders of the GOP are flirting with fascism, the only solution is a complete renewal of the entire political class.

Pete and Kamala are a beginning for centrists. AOC and the Squad is a beginning for leftists.

2. Unlike assessment increases, which increase property tax and benefit the community, rent increases only benefit owners. A rent increase should trigger a higher tax rate. On the flip side, holding rent steady could cause tax to decrease ( to some limit ). This is a new idea I haven't thought about before, but the idea is to align incentives for the owner with the renter.
3. Tax large owners at a higher rate. This will incentive smaller owners. Which appear to be less aggressive on rent increases, and also decentralizes their political power. In markets which are already dominated by large owners this could have unintended side effects. Potentially need hard limits on number of units owned.
4. Prohibit foreign ownership. You should have to live in country to own. Maybe an exception for a single vacation property. Companies with any foreign ownership, prohibited from owning. REITs must guarantee they have no foreign investors.

I honestly don’t know what to say to that. Maybe other than, “America is fucked.”

I live in San Diego and I’ve personally gone from, “I’m really scared for my friends with Mexican heritage” to “Holy shit, you could easily disappear tomorrow”. I have a friend in TJ who crosses the border each day for work (legally, if it matters). She loves San Diego, but I’m worried that she’s just going to vanish, or she’s going to lose her job and in-turn lose her housing...

Neoliberal,comment,Visa,jbj3bw9,NarutoRunner,,"The problem as countless others have highlighted is that people don’t view immigration from a logical or sensible point of view. 

There is a big segment of British society (and the same in many countries) that oppose immigration on racial grounds. Regardless of social progress, they see people of colour as the “other”. You are unlikely to find this data on surveys as very few British people would actually admit their racial views as open racism still has a stigma for most of the population. 

Many have tied “Britishness” to the White Anglo-Saxon paradigm and nothing will change their mind on that. A classic example is the Tory party member who called LBC and essentially explained why Sunak is not fit to be PM on racial grounds. I highly doubt that he is in the minority holding that opinion, he just managed to say it out loud. 

Speak to any British person of colour and they will tell you plenty of stories about how they are often asked “where are they are really from?” despite many having been in Britain for multiple generations.

I'm sorry, but this is somewhat revisionist and is a furthering of our foundational myth of the founding fathers being 'ordinary people'. But in reality, that just isn't the case:

[https://www.politifact.com/article/2015/jul/02/founding-fathers-ordinary-folk/](https://www.politifact.com/article/2015/jul/02/founding-fathers-ordinary-folk/)

>After consulting several scholars and other sources, we found that -- with some exceptions -- central figures in the nation’s founding generally came from privileged backgrounds, attended college at a time when very few people did and, by 1776, were prominent and wealthy.  
>  
>""They weren't ordinary,"" said Brown University emeritus history professor Gordon Wood, author of ""Creation of the American Republic,"" ""Revolutionary Characters: What Made the Founders Different"" and other books. ""They were the elite of the day, involved in highest levels of the society.""

More than any major lower- or middle-class uprising, the Revolutionary War was overwhelmingly about a usurpation of colonial control from the Old World elites back in Continental Europe by the New World elites who actually lived here. The original Constitution reflects this, in that the constitutional convention of 1787 was itself a right-wing counterrevolution that installed an oligarchical state with only the visual trappings of democracy.

By 2012, I had already started moving away from the Republicans. Republican obstructionism in Congress and the debt ceiling fight really frustrated me. Mitt Romney's 47% comment really turned me off. And I didn't want to blow up the ACA (maybe somewhat selfish since I could stay on my parent's insurance). I started considering myself a liberal Republican. 

By 2015 I was just pretty much over Republicans in general. I had become more socially liberal. My major sticking point was actually foreign policy. Obama's was terrible. I wanted Jeb! to win the nomination and honestly I probably would have ended up voting for him in the general (because of emails, socially he was too conservative). 

Once Trump broke out. I was completely done with Republicans. I didn't want Bernie, so I supported Hillary. And I actually liked her. Socially liberal, pro-free trade, and strong on FoPo. I milled around r/HillaryClinton and r/politicaldiscussion during the 2016 election season.

I think most people might be a little frightened if they understood how far this field has advanced in the past 10 years or so.

As for the geopolitical motivation, China both wants and *needs* respectability on the world stage. Without it they will have a harder time politically setting up the parallel institutions needed to break US economic hegemony.

Like I said if China were to wage such a campaign I would see their motivations more focused on establishing the Chinese model as a viable and acceptable alternative to western liberalism than anything else. Would they be any good at it? How much effort would they put into it? I don't know the answers to those questions.

Geopolitics,comment,naturalization,hnl6lzq,cavscout43,,"Really detailed analysis around the geographic factors.   


There are some other ones in play, however.   


Fertility rates have mostly dipped below replacement rates, including in Brazil, and South American being overall stuck in the Middle Income Trap means the immigration appeal simply isn't there to offset it. A greying and in the future shrinking population means fewer bodies for war, less appetite for adventurism, and generally a more domestic focus.   


Historical grievances have been mostly ""settled"" at this point, South America doesn't have the freshly redrawn borders like the Post WW2 areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which saw a sudden removal of their European imperial overlords and hastily redrawn borders. Likewise, the ""melting pot"" of Spanish/Portuguese colonial legacy has had centuries to gradually erase major distinctions between ethnic groups and religions. Yes, there are endemic and lingering racism issues around skin color, but overall Brazilians are Brazilians, Peruvians are Peruvians, and so on. Without the cross border issues of ethnic groups lacking a unified nation state, there are less reasons for border conflict.   


The Elephant in the Room is the Monroe Doctrine: the US has seen fit, and had ample power projection to do so, to intervene and influence South American affairs for a century and a half. The reality is that not only would the US intervene in a large scale shooting war to shape events in their favor, former imperialist powers in Europe may also do so as they have continued to do in Africa and the Middle East.   


On top of all of that, a very mixed economic development cycle has happened over time: around WW1, Argentina's GDP per capital was potentially higher than Western Europe's and even the USA's..obviously that's not the case today. Likewise South America looked to be on a rapid rise, but now with China (a large export market for resources) slowing down and becoming more domestically focused, C19 hitting tourism and globalization hard, it's changing. 2004 - 2018 saw countries like Chile triple their GDP, but now that trend is in question. Brazil's GDP is \~60% of what it was in 2011. Argentina's is similarly down the same amount, but only since 2017.    


South America overall suffers from a paradox of being once nearly at parity with Europe, because it shared very robust bonds with the continent, and also having lost economic steam as those ties weakened by the decade. As China ages and becomes wealthier, we may see manufacturing and supply chains somewhat migrate there, but Africa & South Asia (Climate change risks aside) have vastly more cheap labor, and younger, at hand to entice those.   


Apologies for going all over the board here, but there are many macro level factors at play in keeping South America ""peaceful"" in terms of interstate conflict beyond geography. Cheers!",2021-12-07T12:57:30+00:00,t3_raf7jx

I think it's probably silly to look at land as being perfectly inelastic, I was just trying to explain how I understood one of the above comments. I think, in addition to zoning and institutional issues, technology can also effect the supply of land. i.e. in 1700 if I want to buy land which I can use to commute to the nearest city centre, I need to buy quite close so I can walk or ride a horse there, but after the invention of trains, automobiles or even elevators in highrises, I can now buy land further away from the city centre without it being less convenient. It's as if the supply of available land has expanded. For all intents and purposes, if I want to live and work in or near Toronto, I don't care how much land is available in northern Ontario, but institutional and technological changes can absolutely expand my available options near or in the city.

Politics,comment,passport,e5dl92p,Garbolt,,"Americas history has almost always been like this in some regard. Be it justification for enslaving people, or cause to go to war with others, america has always hated and has always been vicious towards anyone not white. Look what happened to the Japanese Americans that never spent a day out of America in their life. Some were straight executed on the spot for no reason. They were corralled and thrown into camps just like the nazis did to the Jews. America has always been bigoted. Maybe for a small time period in the 90s and 2000s it wasn't horrible, but really it's always been pretty racist. Everywhere non liberal you can almost guarantee in America is not a place you want to be if you're black, or spanish. 

This is anecdotal but I used to live in New Salisbury Indiana 20 years ago. A black family moved in our town because the father of the 3 kids, who were amazingly educated by the way, way more than the hicks in the town had a job managing the factory there. Every Sunday there was at least 40 people outside their house. They weren't doing anything in the daylight, just standing at the edge of the property intimidating the family. The kids got attacked by the other kids every single time they left the property or went to school. The other parents even tried encouraging me to  get in on it. At the time I was 19, and the cops there were already looking the other way when 20 year olds were beating on these 5th grade to 8th grade kids. I never did, always thought those people were fucked up, even though I loved them, grew up with them I knew they were intolerable people and that I couldn't be around them. They would set parts of their property on fire. One night a guy purposefully crashed into the father's car driving home. With a bucket truck and damn near killed the man. The police took 10 minutes to get there, then another 10 to even start helping the guy off the ground. They wouldn't let anyone get near them, so I ran to the payphone and called 911. I even asked if the officers had already called and they said they had not received any calls for the ambulance in the last 2 hours. So I knew that they had lied when they said they called the ambulance for him. When I got back to the scene he was on his back dragged off to the side on the sidewalk and they were sitting by the patrol car, one of them smoking on a cigar. They yelled st me when I asked the man if he was alright. 

Not only where those people racist, but they were actively attempting to kill this man AND his family because he was black. He was really well kept, he was educated, worked hard and smart. Very nice, religious and they still didn't accept him. He was black. He needed to be removed. Plain and simple. These are the same people to claim to be real Americans, to be the embodiment of America. These are the people who think they are the only true Americans anymore. The supposed followers of christ. Lovers of all. In my experience this has been true in most areas like my home town. Off grid farm country, back wood stix kind of place, almost always racist in some way. Well, back then anyway, I haven't been up that way in little over 20 years. ",2018-09-04T14:29:42+00:00,t1_e5d9vv1

I'm not arguing that, I believe it should be up to businesses if they want to serve unvaccinated people or not. 

The practical reality of why they are mandating everyone is because of spread (and to your point on that, vaccinated people infect others at a dramatically reduced rate, so you can't just handwave that away) and because the more you make the rule specific on age/comorbiddities/etc the likelyhood of non compliance due to feeling singled out increases.",2021-08-06T13:19:35+00:00,t1_h7xipde

>Some donors interviewed by ProPublica said they would welcome the legal clarity provided by the court decision. “Finally, we can cross without fear,” said Gamaliel, a resident of Ciudad Juárez who previously told his story of being a donor. “It was always so risky.” Nevertheless, he said, he would still only go back to donate in case of a financial emergency, because of the health risks associated with frequent plasma donations. As ProPublica and ARD found, frequent plasma donation was harming the health of some Mexican citizens who relied on the system for money. Some frequent donors were underweight and showed low levels of antibodies.

For me, there's a lot to unpack here. On one hand, having clarity at the border is only fair, and should be implemented post-haste. On the other hand, having critical parts of the healthcare system relying on those in financial need sacrificing their health to make ends meet is also deeply disturbing. I don't know if there is a good way forward from this, but at the very least there should be a clear and consistent system at the border in place.",2022-09-21T01:15:45+00:00,t3_xjqh29

It's the same when people say the police state is vastly over funded, unfairly traget minority communities, provide uneven and disproportionate prison sentences, and are propped up by military equipment as well as an unsustainable budget for prisons that focus wrongly on PUNISHMENT and not REHABILITATION.

> Reforming the immigration visa system is crucial for the future of the United States. In late 2019, Rep. John Curtis (R‑UT), supported by Gov. Gary Herbert, introduced a bill to create a state‐​based visa system. Curtis’s proposal adopts a major component of the Canadian immigration system: visas sponsored by individual states rather than the federal government. Under the legislation, the federal government maintains control over admissions, security checks, and other necessary criteria, while the state governments gain power to select individual migrants and regulate their activity within the state. Each state would get an average of 10,000 visas a year: 5,000 guaranteed for each state and an additional number assigned based on population.

> With the partisan gridlock that has characterized Washington politics for at least the past two decades, can and should states lead the way on immigration by utilizing a state‐​based visa system?

Conservative,comment,citizenship,hww8ume,letitgo392781243,,"So before I start my like 10 page rant, here's one basic thing no one has mentioned, presumably because you all regularly read the news. 

I didn't really start paying attention to the news until I was like...oh God, 26? But anyway, during those long media blackouts, the only thing that ever actually changed my daily routine and life was the pandemic, and I think the only  news stories that have ever reached me in those periods were presidental election results, massive tragic disasters, and the events at the Capitol last January . And none of those changed the way I live day to day. (I know this is partially because I'm lucky, bur I think there are a lot of other really lucky people out there. So it's great to be informed, but do keep in mind that this is bothering you because you sought out information that would bother you. 

Get rid of birthright citizenship? Sure, that's fine. It seems to make sense for a child's residency status should align with their parents. 

Do I think that birthright citizenship is unfair or going to ""wreck the country?"" The unfairness; yes, I could see that, but as I've grown older, I've come to appreciate fairness in a different way. When you're in kindergarten, they teach you that fairness means giving everyone the same thing all the time, but as adults, we should understand that it's not so black and white. 

Here's an example that I hope isn't emotionally charged:  I live in Virginia, which has areas where you can find a 2 bedroom for $600 a month and also areas where you cant find an efficiency for under $1000 a month for many miles in every direction. The minimum wage, however, doesn't change across the entire state. That means that a person working for minimum wage in a small town in the mountains might be able to afford getting by. It also means that, as a young'un working for minimum wage in the expensive area where I grew up, I paid $500 a month for part of a living room, not even the whole thing...someone else had the other half. It was totally illegal; some overcrowding laws I think. I had curtains as walls and a bunch of craigslist randos as roommates, and I could still barely afford food. (It wasn't that bad; that's actually how I met my husband. But I digress.) 

So...is it fair that we should have an equal minimum wage across the entire state, with everyone getting the same thing, even though it means a very different quality of life for the different people it applies to?

Back to my original point: nothing is ever really ""fair."" My quality of life improved drastically when I stopped looking over at the person next to me and judging or envying. It's ok to just worry about what directly affects your life. If the person next to you was given an unfair headstart, so what? It sucks. Whatever. Most of the things politicians do suck, regardless of party. But that doesn't speed up  citizenship process or slow it down for those not obtaining citizenship through birthright. It has no tangible effect on the process that that a legal immigrant has to go through. 

As for a more diverse and a higher population ""wrecking the country..."" What do you consider ""wrecked?"" Like how will the country look when the immigrants and Democrats ""wreck"" it? I just don't understand what you mean. You're using pretty general words. You've mentioned that the new people in the country will take all the jobs, but who will give those people those jobs? More people. So, while having more people does mean that more jobs are taken, it also means that more jobs are available. Furthermore, immigrants who have started their own businesses tend to higher other immigrants, taking even fewer American jobs. (I mean, who wants to be the one white person in a Vietnamese nail salon? You would have no idea what they were saying.) 

So I guess the other way Democrats are ""wrecking the country"" is by passing socialist bills. I do see that fear, and I'm pretty scared of the massive spending too. We're like a shopaholic who fucked their banker to get a limitless credit card and is now going nuts with no way to ever afford to pay it back. It's crazy, it terrifies me, and I have no idea what to do about it. 

Also, quick sidenote...getting government aid is not as easy as you think, or at least, it wasn't before the pandemic. I'm severely bipolar and at one point tried to apply for unemployment and disability since I kept getting fired for not being able to control my episodes at work, and I was really genuinely trying to work and be good, but just struggling really hard. I know the way this process went was at least partially because of the horrible state of mind, but the application processes took me days, and I'm not sure if I even submitted it right, because I never heard anything back. I didn't have the energy to try again after the first time, so I gave up and couch surfed for a while until I evened out. I also never got any of my stimulus payments, and if you go online it says to call, and when Ive called I've been bounced around between bots until I've eventually given up.


I'm more interested, though, in addressing the general I have never seen a decision made by a few hundred people that an entire country agrees on. Someone is always unhappy, and generally speaking, if they reach a balanced compromise, everyone ends up unhappy. That's just the nature of that sort of thing. Democrats spent the whole time Trump was in office freaking out that the conservatives were ""wrecking the country,"" as so many have put it. We share the same fears, just about different things. We at least have that in common. 

I totally see the fear conservatives are having right now. Biden came straight out of the gate with an aggressive 180 when half the country was emotionally attached to a figurehead with the opposite ideals. He should have been more sensitive  to how divided the nation is right now, and how threatened the conservatives feel. You all needed more time to grieve for Trump before you had to say goodbye to the safety you found in him. 

Personally, I'm a straight moderate. I lean either democrat or republican depending on the issue. And what I'm a lot more worried about right now, more than immigration, more than Biden blowing through...is it millions or trillions now? I fucking lost count. What I'm worried about is the way that the two sides are literally afraid of each other. 

Living in fear isn't healthy. It breeds distrust, resentment, and hatred. 

The issue we should all actually be talking about is how to fix the giant rift in this country.",2022-02-14T10:49:38+00:00,t3_srrevy

No.  I think Hartwick's premise that ""Education has emerged as a clear cleavage in addition to more traditional indicators of social class. The highly educated fare better in a more globalized world that puts a premium on human capital"" is flawed.  

Many working class white Republicans are college educated; they simply lack the ancestry and capital that are a white person's entree into elite institutions of higher education. They are employed in positions that require a college education, but they are not highly compensated (i.e., teaching, law enforcement, nursing, etc.).  

""Status"" is a concern of elites and the downtrodden; it is not a focus of working class people, white or otherwise.  I think Hartwick is projecting; status anxiety is what *he* would be feeling, were he a working class white person.

The Democratic Party deliberately ejected working class white men from the party in the 1960s, and the Republican Party never represented them.  The constituency remained entirely unrepresented for decades, until their numbers alone resulted in the remaking of the Republican Party. That, along with the common concerns of working class people of all races, is what I believe holds the US right wing coalition together.",2022-02-11T16:11:14+00:00,t3_spn5rc

Climatechange,comment,naturalization,iirc3mi,Beeker93,,"Ok, fair. Why engage though? I guess this was more of a bioethics/environmental ethics question about if it is right to alter the natural course of things for our own benefit. Like, should our focus be strictly undoing what humans do, or just doing what ever leads to fewer extinctions, a planet that is easier to live on, and more biodiversity?

These thought experiments can be handy in some cases. I recall seeing one proposal of seeding fast growing trees onto every island despite the fact this tree disrupted biodiversity in these places and was such a temporary fix that didn't do much in the grand scheme of things. It would seem like, besides less usable farm land, unstable coast lines, and issues with water, the main issues with climate change is biodiversity and biocollapse, but sometimes I see people that propose solutions which only seem to focus on temperature and do terrible things for biodiversity. Like utilizing potentially invasive species in places they don't belong. Seeding clouds over oceans and painting roof tops white doesn't do anything for ocean acidification from CO2 -> carbonic acid. Turning deserts green can store carbon but destroys desert biodiversity (granted reversing desertification would seem like a good thing to do, even if that desert growing would have been a natural process).

I get that the only solid solutions are getting our civilization off of it's addiction to fossil fuels, using our land better, and changing agricultural practices. My question doesn't propose any solutions or statements of what to do, but it asks what we should do.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,naturalization,e3n3wda,Luc3121,,"I guess you could say dictatures and (semi-)authoritarian states naturally trend towards nationalistic rhetoric in order to justify their leadership when ideology doesn't do the job anymore nor appeal to enough people. A 'common enemy' is often needed to keep the authoritarian leadership somewhat legitimate in the minds of the people, and fuelling nationalism (can also be ethnic nationalism with internal enemies) does help to strengthen the feeling of enmity. Integration of states would then be more difficult in a more nationalist-minded country, though there's enough exceptions to this rule. Ethnic or racial nationalism can often exceed states' borders, think unification of the Koreas, African union, Third Reich, etc, as well as things like annexations being able to increase support/legitimacy for a regime in nationalist-minded countries (think Turkey vs. Greece and Cyprus, Russia vs. Ukraine and Georgia, Nazi Germany with areas nearby).

On the other hand nationalism can also be used in liberal democracies as a means of gathering support, though in some democracies this works better (e.g. US, Spain, Poland, Scotland, Flanders and Turkey) than in others (like Sweden and Germany). In many countries nationalism doesn't per se conflict with integration, e.g. Poland and Hungary, as long as the political elite profits from it (electorally or in terms of corruption/financial benefits).

I think it's really difficult to attribute integration to authoritarianism or whatever, often times it's about the mindsets of the political elite. In Western Europe, the political elites are much more open to European integration than the electorate. Apparently the priorities of either the people (through punishing politicians by voting for other parties) or the political elite (economic growth, responsibility for doing 'what is good' in the long term, etc) differ from eachother.",2018-08-05T11:14:48+00:00,t3_94nswe

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Immigration,e12buk9,Noobie678,,"First off, what? Babies? People here like to complain about how much they make being a server, barista, or cashier where they can barely get enough hours in, but bring up farm work and it's not even a thought. They may consider trade work or military **but never farm work**. I don't think people realize how much Americans can make picking fruits because the farming industry is practically begging for them, given how unreliable undocumented immigrants are and when they'll be deported.

Yet you and your cushy job **will only do such work if you were paid as much as a fucking surgeon**. Who's the real baby here? 

I really shouldn't even be schooling you on this because you pretty much proved my point for me **Farm work is beneath Americans so much so as they need to be paid as much as corporate executives to do it**. Give me a break. The work is just too hard, that's all it is. They'd rather do a two year apprenticeship and break their back being a plumber or do hard construction work. 

50% of people in this country have an income of 32k/year when they could easily make 10k-20k more doing farm work. I worked on a farm to pay for school. I made $15/hr went I could've easily made that in to a career with the raises that they offered. **Americans would rather make minimum wage serving coffee than make a decent living working on a farm**

Finally, you can only pay so much money to workers before it stops being cost efficient. And it takes alot of workers to work a farm (you can't be paying everyone $100). You have to keep in mind we our farming industry is competing on the global stage. No one is gonna wanna buy shit from us if it's so goddamn expensive.",2018-06-21T18:53:31+00:00,t1_e1250fb

The point is, the majority doesn't hold the right to make individuals decisions for them.

But if we want to look at it literally, killing the sheep is worse than the wolves starving, since they'll just starve anyway, in the vacuum. Voting to kill the sheep ends with 100% death due to lack of food. Sure the wolves might starve out, but sheep don't rely on tyranny to eat in the scenario and will live to die an old age death. But sure, keep voting to kill minorities and thinking you're a great person for your lack of critical thinking.

No, it means that person shares in the substantial benefits accumulated from over 200 years of U.S. citizens paying taxes, building government and infrastructure, and fighting wars for freedom.  Those are special privileges and it is very reasonable to reserve them primarily for U.S. citizens.
