Climatechange,post,agriculture,20taok,Hopkinsps5,Mechanical Carbon Capture and Sequestration is not the Answer to our CO2 problem,"So I've been reading a little bit about this new carbon capture technology.  Basically, air is sucked into this kind of filtration system which then sequesters it into underground storage like an old oil well.  Supposedly, these systems will pull CO2 out of the air faster than natural sources like plants will.  While I don't dispute that particular claim, I think it misses the point.

When you create a CO2 molecule, you lose an O2 molecule.  This is why my lawn mower needs to have the choke wide open to run.  The O2 (air) is sucked into through the intake, helps facilitate the burning of the fossil fuel, combines with a carbon atom, and is shot out the exhaust. 

Carbon capture and sequestration seems to simply take the CO2 out of the air and not replace it with O2.  So in addition to the sequestration, you would need something like an artificial photosynthesis “machine” to suck that carbon back out of sequestration, separate the carbon from the O2 molecule and put the O2 back into the air.

Another issue here is that Carbon Capture and Sequestration requires energy.  More specifically, it requires man-made energy.  So these units need to be near some kind of power station.  This draws power away from industry and homes, and will most certainly lead to more power needing to be produced.  Power is still (for the most part) a dirty business and will pump more CO2 into the system.

It seems to me that this is a bit of a progress trap.  It's like we think we can fix everything by inventing some new gadget, but we fail to see the wisdom in what other affects that gadget has.

Plant life existed on this planet long before animals ever came into existence.  In fact, and argument can be made that plant life is what made this planet habitable to animal life in the first place.  Plants and animals live is a sort of “CO2 symbiosis”, where animal life converts O2 to CO2 and plants convert CO2 to O2.

Plants require sunlight, water and some soil nutrients (amounts and types vary among species) to create O2 from CO2.  During this process, the plant not only creates O2 but many other products that can be used by Humans as well.  Food and Wood are two things most people think of, but there are others.  Plants can produce the building blocks of bio-fuels.  Dead plant matter can help restore topsoil erosion.  

What I would suggest rather than relying on one more man made gadget, is to begin to terraform and replant multilevel “permaculture” style forest gardens.  

The terraforming involved is basically to create a system of small swales or ditches running mostly level and parallel to ground contours.  This creates a system of capture, that does not allow water to shed off the land.  The water is absorbed into the ground rather than flowing into streams and rivers.  There would also be some pond retention systems.  For a much more well written and detailed description, one could refer to “Water For Every Farm: Yeomans Keyline Plan” by P.A. Yeomans.

These swales would be placed in intervals of 30 to 50 feet up and down the land slope.  Below these swales, a row of trees would be planted.  These trees could be a mix of local wild, and product trees like Fruit and nut bearing species.  Intermittently, within the row, vines like Grapes could be planted.  Southerly of the row, a tall shrubs row could be placed.  Southerly again, a row of shorter shrubs, and so one down to grassland.  

Again, please refer to “Restoration Agriculture” by Mark Shepard for more detail.  But the long and short is that you create a landscape that: creates O2 from the abundance of CO2 in the atmosphere, requires no man-made energy once it is in place, heals land, and creates potential crops for human use and consumption.

This could be done on a massive scale across the farmlands of the US that have been decimated by mono-cropping, or on reclaimed industrial or residential areas that have gone by the wayside.  Since we are talking about such a huge swath of land, it may make up for an individual plants' ability to capture and convert CO2.  While I haven't seen studies on the requirements for replanting, I'd be willing to wager that this would put a massive dent in the excess CO2.

The process of doing this would also create a lot of jobs.  And while this would be a fairly labor intensive process, it isn't rocket science.  The kind of work that is being discussed here is done by earthwork contractors and landscapers every day.  People could be easily trained to do this.  It also doesn't require huge machinery (and thus huge amounts of fossil fuels) to do either.  It could literally be done with simple surveying equipment, a small tractor with a few attachments, and a team of 3-4 people each.  

Once the system is in place, it would actually create more jobs as well.  Without huge swaths of acreage to sow, spray, and harvest, the era of the large tractor combines would be over.  Manufacturers would need to downscale agriculture equipment, making for some “creative destruction”.  But needing a new kind of equipment, would keep many of those same businesses in place.    More human labor would be required as well, simply to maintain and harvest these areas.  

What I am basically putting forth is a modern twist on what the Civilian Conservation Corps did in the 1930's to deal with the Dust Bowl that struck most of the American Midwest. 

Then maybe add to this the use of Carbon Capture & Sequestration in urban and industrial areas if needed.  But I don't think the mass use of Carbon Capture & Sequestration Technology is going to be the answer here.

I invite discussion and criticism.  I don't claim to have all the answers.  My name is Patrick and I'm just a guy with an interest in this stuff.  But I have a baby boy and I want to leave him a better world than I inherited.  My wife says I'm a little “crunchy”

No.  There is no reason to do this.  The atmosphere is ~20% O2, but only around 0.04% CO2.  If you sequestered every last molecule of CO2 (which would be a *really* bad idea), atmospheric O2 wouldn't change much.

Climatechange,post,agriculture,3im8ln,kriegson,"Dissemination of the ""Scientific Consensus""","**What is it?**   

Popularized by John Cook's (in)famous paper in which a number of studies were collected and cataloged to find a ""Consensus"" of 97% of all scientists supporting....well that's the first problem.  
AGW occuring was the original intent, but ""Scientific consensus"" gets thrown at just about anything now. Sea level rise, dangerous weather conditions, dangerous PH levels in the ocean, any feasible effect of climate change, anthropogenic or otherwise, often gets the ""consensus"" argument thrown at it.   

-------
**So what's the problem?**   

Aside from how it's often used (appeal to authority, peer pressure) is the fact that the John cook study, along with several others often used to prop up the presumed ""consensus"" aren't actually a representation of the entire scientific community *or* a consensus on AGW and its effects.    


For instance: [Cook et al 2013](https://wryheat.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/cooks-consensus.jpg) only covers papers, not scientists themselves explicitly. Of those papers, only .5% explicitly endorse and and quantifies AGW as 50% of greater the cause of warming, from his own sample. 
This graph simply represents the text document (Address listed in the image) in which the papers are properly addressed.   
This is the briefest and simplest explanation of what is wrong with his study, though there are plenty of verbose and far more detailed dissemination available upon request (or a simple google search :P).    

Also consider, 11,944 papers not necessarily scientists, though nearly 8000 of those had no position. So lets aim a little high and say 3944 can be shown to support AGW as the primary cause of warming from this study.     
Some modest estimates for how many academic scientists exist in the world ring up around 10-12 million.

I'm happy to point out the flaws in any said studies, should someone have them available, though they often fell into one of the following problems regarding consensus:  

*   Small sample size  

*  Vague questionnaire (very open questions)   

*  Not determining confidence   

*  Not determining whether AGW is detrimental or what degree can be 

--------

Further, being generous let's say that between cook et al 2013 and several other studies, we triple the number of scientists who hold consensus on AGW, assuming they aren't counting the same people twice, the surveys ask the right questions, etc. We end up with 11832 scientists who support AGW theory and quantify it as having caused 50% or more of our warming.

-----------   

**The bottom line**  

Consensus doesn't matter in science. It's irrelevant.    

Yesterday's popular theory could be today's debunked one. An excellent example is Karl et al 2015, a study which used (until the point) adjustments no one else really had within NASA, NOAA the British oceanic institute, it bore little resemblance to IPCC projections as well.    

And yet, it explained why the pause doesn't exist. Considered an anomaly by some that, by rights simply shouldn't exist, this breakthrough gave them the explanation they were looking for, and was adopted by many.    
Whether or not Karl et al 2015 will stand the test of time is another question entirely, though this is a perfect example of how consensus means little in science.   

Politics aside, it has no place in science. Scientests may form a consensus on reliable studies, but reliable studies are not formed through scientific consensus. ",2015-08-27T16:47:55+00:00,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

2. There is a general agreement within the relevant scientific community.

3. The scientific community is either very active, or very accepted.

For papers quantifying the anthropogenic contributions to global warming, the chart you linked says that 64 papers endorse AGW as the major cause and 9 reject it.

Now you're falling for the same problems as the consensus in the first place, which is instantly assuming that everyone conceedes mankind is the primary element, or they do not. If they concede we have any affect, than they must be conceding we are the primary affect.

I find you do, considering *global warming* isn't even the discussion. It's AGW and to what degree it can be attributed to climate change.  
Further, you're making a strawman with geocenterism. 

On top of that, ""A study with a question"" would be considered a survey, and only respondents who reply would be considered (likely around 30% if online). A survey greatly differs from this study where basically 40% of the papers were effectively irrelevant in the discussion because they didn't even support one argument or the other.

Again, if you have a room of 10 people and ask if they belive in god, one says yes, two are agnostic, you cannot state they all believe in god. The obvious conclusion (Aside from the lack of consensus) is is that most people are agnostic and belive in a deity, but not a specific god (in our case, AGW to a degree but not necessarily being the driver of the climate).  

To infer anything more from that is political agenda at best. Consensus is not binary. Indeed, the more positions you have on the subject and the more people taking those positions, the less consensus there is.

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,cujy9pu,OniTan,,"> The credentials, verification process, and authenticity of the signatories have been questioned.

> Jeff Jacoby promoted the Oregon Institute petition as delegates convened for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1998. Jacoby, a columnist for the Boston Globe, said event organizers ""take it for granted"" that global warming is real when scientists do not agree ""that greater concentrations of CO2 would be harmful"" or ""that human activity leads to global warming in the first place.""[17] George Woodwell and John Holdren, two members of the National Academy of Sciences, responded to Jacoby in the International Herald Tribune, describing the petition as a ""farce"" in part because ""the signatories are listed without titles or affiliations that would permit an assessment of their credentials.""[18] Myanna Lahsen said, ""Assuming that all the signatories reported their credentials accurately, credentialed climate experts on the list are very few."" The problem is made worse, Lahsen notes, because critics ""added bogus names to illustrate the lack of accountability the petition involved"".[19] Approved names on the list included fictional characters from the television show M*A*S*H,[20] the movie Star Wars,[19] Spice Girls group member Geri Halliwell, English naturalist Charles Darwin (d. 1882) and prank names such as ""I. C. Ewe"".[21] When questioned about the pop singer during a telephone interview with Joseph Hubert of the Associated Press, Robinson acknowledged that her endorsement and degree in microbiology was inauthentic, remarking ""When we're getting thousands of signatures there's no way of filtering out a fake"".[20] A cursory examination by Todd Shelly of the Hawaii Reporter revealed duplicate entries, single names lacking any initial, and even corporate names. ""These examples underscore a major weakness of the list: there is no way to check the authenticity of the names. Names are given, but no identifying information (e.g., institutional affiliation) is provided.""[22] According to the Petition Project website, the issue of duplication has been resolved.[23] Kevin Grandia offered similar criticism, saying although the Petition Project website provides a breakdown of ""areas of expertise"", it fails to assort the 0.5% of signatories who claim to have a background in Climatology and Atmospheric Science by name, making independent verification difficult. ""This makes an already questionable list seem completely insignificant"".[24]

> In 2001, Scientific American took a random sample ""of 30 of the 1,400 signatories claiming to hold a Ph.D. in a climate-related science.""

> Of the 26 we were able to identify in various databases, 11 said they still agreed with the petition —- one was an active climate researcher, two others had relevant expertise, and eight signed based on an informal evaluation. Six said they would not sign the petition today, three did not remember any such petition, one had died, and five did not answer repeated messages. Crudely extrapolating, the petition supporters include a core of about 200 climate researchers – a respectable number, though rather a small fraction of the climatological community.[25]

> Former New Scientist correspondent Peter Hadfield says scientists are not experts on every topic, as depicted by the character Brains in Thunderbirds. Rather, they must specialize:

 > ""In between Aaagard and Zylkowski, the first and last names on the petition, are an assortment of metallurgists, botanists, agronomists, organic chemists and so on. ... The vast majority of scientists who signed the petition have never studied climatology and don't do any research into it. It doesn't matter if you're a Ph.D. A Ph.D in metallurgy just makes you better at metallurgy. It does not transform you into some kind of expert in paleoclimatology. ... So the petition's suggestion that everyone with a degree in metallurgy or geophysics knows a lot about climate change, or is familiar with all the research that's been done, is patent crap.""[26][27]

Once you've got some molecules of CO2 in the air, the effect of each next molecule is less than the one before, because those wavelengths are already getting scattered, and mostly heat is already only getting out in other wavelengths.

>Right now, alot of species are dying out because of mankind and climate change is one of them.

There was a great article about this that identified where species loss generally occurs. Let's see if I can find it. Here it is: https://aeon.co/essays/we-are-not-edging-up-to-a-mass-extinction

For me, that was one of those rare articles that changed my perspective a bit. To be clear, extinctions of species is a real problem. But it isn't occurring where I thought and due to the causes I thought.

>Eventually, climate change will cause geo politics to wage war for arable land for water, food and actually to be habitable.

That's certainly a possibility, but I don't see that as likely. Let me see if I can communicate why. First, though, all of the things you list depend on population, and it is my considered opinion that global population will peak at around 9.5 billion people between the years 2060 and 2080. That's probably a discussion for another day.

**Arable land:** I guess it's appropriate to make this point in this thread, given the OPs title, but there will be some benefits to CO2 increases, if not generalized warming. We've observed high plant production and lower water requirements for plants both in the lab and on the planet as a whole since CO2 concentrations began rising. Now there are marginal returns from this to be sure, but it is something to consider. Enough warming will result in more arable lands in some places (Canada, Russia, some Scandinavian countries) and losses in others. Or, more appropriately, changes in what can be grown in certain places. 

**Water:** This one is very hard to predict indeed. We expect more rainfall overall since warming leads to more evaporation, hence more precipitation. The big, and as yet unanswered, question is whether that rain will fall in present deserts or in already wet regions. If the former, that would be a good thing. If that latter, that will produce problems as crops won't be able to be harvested.

I have followed desalination technology fairly closely, and I do believe present technology is sufficient to mitigate changes in rainfall patterns to some extent. I mean, clearly we won't turn the Sahara into the world's breadbasket, but we can reduce coastal cities' dependence on rivers and leave much of that upstream water for farming. The last I looked, the energy requirements for desalination had fallen to about 2.5 kWh per cubic meter of seawater. A decade ago it was about 10 kWh / m^3 .

**Food:** This is mostly a function of the previous two items, but perhaps less so than most realize. I'm one of the mods for a little sub, /r/UrbanAgriculture, that tracks indoor farming. I was surprised to learn that maybe 1/5th or so of the food people eat is already grown in cities. The great advantages to indoor farming is that it takes a tiny fraction of the water outdoor agriculture uses and it isn't dependent on outdoor temperatures. 

But a bigger element of food resilience in the near to medium term is that we are misusing a great deal of cropland today to grow crops for biofuels. It's madness. I think there is a future for biofuels, but it will come in the form of algae, not corn.

**Habitable [land]:** I'm least concerned about this one. Look at Phoenix, Arizona or the cities of the Middle East for examples of why. Projected temperature increases are not so large as to make many places as harsh as those environments where we already have thriving cities.

With all that said, I am not dismissing the possibilities of resource conflicts. All I'm saying is that there are lots of choices we can make now that will drastically reduce the likelihood of such conflicts going forward.",2016-12-15T21:56:07+00:00,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

 * [Diatoms](http://www.highco2-iv.org/2074) not evolving fast enough to handle the combination of UV radiation, heat, and acidification->  Negative impact on base of food chain, fishing, oxygen production, breathing air as diatoms/plankton produce 80% of oxygen on earth. This is actually a very complex issue and I'm just skimming the potential negatives here. 

 * [Oyster shells dissolving](http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/Ocean+Acidification's+impact+on+oysters+and+other+shellfish) -> Oysters clean/filter the water - oyster farmers have to move or shut down - eating oysters 

 * Corals dying -> **Some** corals can survive increased ocean acidification - many cannot and stress and bleach.  Loss of ecosystem that tiny fish use -> negative impact on base of food chain. 

* [Birds](http://www.smh.com.au/national/heatwave-kills-hundreds-of-birds-in-wa-20090113-7g1f.html),  [Bats](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-08/hundred-thousand-dead-bats-after-qld-heatwave-rspca-says/5190644), [Bees](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-reese-halter/australian-honeybees-unable-to-make-honey_b_4670475.html), lizards dying from heat -> Loss of food chain, pollinators ->  foods we eat and flowers needs pollinators. Loss of animals to eat mosquitoes. More mosquitoes. 

* Crops in the Temperate Zones of the globe not benefiting (United States, Syria, China ... ) :  a 1 deg change is easily detected and scientists already measuring effects [decreasing staple crop yields](http://cornandsoybeandigest.com/corn/how-warmer-temps-higher-c02-will-affect-your-corn-soybeans)  in [many studies](http://www.agmrc.org/renewable-energy/climate-change-and-agriculture/climate-change-consequences-for-agriculture-in-iowa/). How? (the below bullet points are from the articles linked) 

 * Higher night temperatures reduce carbon uptake, interfering with corn’s pollen viability, fertilization and grain formation, ... the corn yield/July temperature relationship from Indiana suggests a yield decrease of 2.1 bushels per acre for every degree Fahrenheit increase...

 * Changes in precipitation patterns and an increase in temperatures are affecting nitrogen (N) management for crop production. Increased rainfall in early to late spring forces crop producers to delay in-season fertilization, which often results in a yield penalty (Balkcom et al. 2003). 

 * Excessively wet soils are prone to N losses via denitrification, with an estimated 4 to 5 percent loss of N per day when soils are saturated (Sawyer 2008). 

 * Application of N in the fall when soil temperatures fall below 50 degrees Fahrenheit... soil temperatures in Ames, Iowa, historically were almost certain to drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit by October 2. However, on October 24, 2010, most of Iowa still had soil temperatures into the mid to high 50s, which resulted in delaying N application that fall

 * TLDR;  farmers *right now* are very concerned about climate change as it's impacting them right now as we're up now about 1.5 deg C rise over the historical average (1950-1980).

The lowest level of global catastrophe indicated is something along the lines of a 1km diameter asteroid striking the earth, impacting billions while also leaving billions of survivors. 

http://lesswrong.com/lw/n48/levels_of_global_catastrophes_from_mild_to/

I ask this to try and get a feel for this subreddit's feel for tolerance and risk management and try to iterate to some common understanding of how we categorize outcomes. 

From an extreme standpoint, I'm beginning with the perspective that life on earth will inevitably come to an end in a few billions years maximum as a result of the sun's life cycle. It's not so much if human's will meet their demise, but when. That said, I'll argue with a bias in favor of human longevity as measured by (pop. size * life span * potential future generations). It's an arbitrary starting point. 

Based upon the information available to me, my gut feel is that the odds of a global catastrophe are ~ 40%. I am very bullish about technological innovation that will dramatically reduce the need to burn fossil fuels. I'm guessing that we are no more than 10-15 years from peak voluntary emissions. 

On the downside, I'm concerned about the inertia we've already introduced into the system, additional inputs in the coming decades and the time we have to adapt. 

Economic dislocation due to loss of fossil fuel revenues will be tremendous. The likelihood of extreme coastal real estate losses (many times the severity of the 2008 financial crisis) is very high and timing of these losses will be paramount in determining the severity of the outcome. Due to subsidence and limestone geography, I think areas like N. Orleans and S. Florida are already destined to be toast.  

In a scenario in which hundreds of millions of people need to migrate and agricultural capacity declines, the ability to govern becomes trickier and we could experience a more profound catastrophe. I'll put that at 10%. 

There are enough unknowns here that I'll begin with the assumption that none of us has a crystal ball to the future. I hope this will frame a robust discussion of the SCIENCE that informs us of the risks. ",2018-03-17T10:06:40+00:00,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Climatechange,comment,agriculture,dvuir00,InvisibleRegrets,,"It's not just the burning of fossil fuels though. Even if we (somehow) reduced emissions to zero in 15 years, there is also the aerosol effect to consider (0.8-1.2°C of warming), and the effects of continued deforestation. 

Deforestation is unavoidable if we continue to have a growing population and/or increasing quality of life for the developing world - its been predicted that milk demand in China alone will result in a 30%increase in GHG emissions from cows between now and 2050 - and a large increase in deforestation as well. The Amazon alone has 150-200 Pg of stored carbon - equal to around 18 years of current emissions - and is responsible for sequestering ~0.4 Pg of carbon per year. The WWF estimates that we have deforested around 18% of the amazon in the past 50 years, and recent estimates (2018) suggest a ""tipping point"" of 20-25% deforestation. That is only the Amazon, let alone rainforest in Asia and Africa, or forests in North America that are burning down and already starting to *not grow back*.

We also should consider the reduced carbon sink ability of the ocean as it warms, as well as increased ocean acidity on the ability for essential biodiversity to flourish.

Then think about the permafrost and any potential forcing from a permafrost that is *already melting* at an increased rate.

Now consider that there is a 15-30 year lag time between the emissions of GHGs and the full effects being felt. That means we are only just feeling the effects of the early 2000's, and our emissions ramped up from there until 2014, when we stayed even for a few years and now increasing again. We haven't started to see the full effects of this yet. Now, consider the combined effects of 15 more years of (decreasing, under your scenario) emissions, combined with atmospheric aerosol loss, increased deforestation, loss of the oceanic carbon sink (and forest carbon sinks), increased emissions from permafrost and forest biomes, etc.

We are currently at ~1°C of warming. With a lowball aerosol effect we're at 1.8, and with 15 years of emissions more, that is an easy 2. Consider everything else, I would estimate an *extremely* optimistic scenario of 2.25°C by 2055 or so. This is if we don't trigger any ""tipping points"" such as the amazon or permafrost, etc.

Is this enough to cause catastrophe? Some would say yes, some would say no. It depends on a lot of factors including how much attention we give to adaptation technologies and structural reforms. Also not considering potential tipping points in oceanic phytoplankton levels, etc that could collapse the food chain and/or oxygen production methods (as I don't know what level of warming would probabilisticaly cause those).

In any case, even best case 15 year zero emissions, no feedbacks or tipping points - we're looking at a very rough future. ",2018-03-17T14:29:07+00:00,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,dvunnv8,DocHarford,,"I'm not sure that trying to put ""global catastrophe levels"" into a taxonomy really illustrates anything interesting. It seems more likely to be just another way of expressing a specific combination of anxiety and uncertainty.

For instance, it's possible that the sustainable population-carrying capacity of the Earth is lower than the current population. Is a long-term population decline which ultimately reaches that sustainable level a ""global catastrophe""? It might or might not, depending on where you draw the lines. But the lines don't have any independent significance. 

Our ability to model climate states *and human responses* several decades in the future is very limited. Further, a gamma-ray burst could tear off half our atmosphere tomorrow — we can't really model that probability either, except to say that with current crude models the likelihood seems pretty low. We don't even know how likely it is that we'll have a civilization long enough to be affected by climate change. 

Specific impacts are easier to talk about, at least, and I think the ocean is the right place to start. Coastal land loss can be mitigated by the not-exactly-new technology of building seawalls: So that's a political problem, not a technological one.

Ecosystem collapse in the ocean (and not just due to acidification) is more worrying, since we probably don't have the tools to manage that ecosystem effectively. But humans have already adapted to some smallish ecosystem collapses in that environment. It may be that the development of further adaptations (e.g.: aquaculture) is just a matter of scaling up. 

Terrestrial agriculture is a hugely adaptable industry, though. I can't put this into quantitative terms, but it seems to me that given just 75% of the ag resources currently known in the New World, a huge variety of ag outputs are possible. I don't think New World agriculture has been maximized for quantity output in some time, but if market demand develops then I'll bet huge maximization leaps are possible. For this reason I consider terrestrial agriculture a medium concern, rather than an urgent one. Although the Eastern Hemisphere might be more precarious, if desertification is a huge impact there.

>Here we show that the massive 2014–2015 fissure eruption in Holuhraun, Iceland, reduced the size of liquid cloud droplets—consistent with expectations—*but had no discernible effect on other cloud properties*. The reduction in droplet size led to cloud brightening and global-mean radiative forcing of around −0.2 watts per square metre for September to October 2014. Changes in cloud amount or cloud liquid water path, however, were undetectable, *indicating that these indirect effects, and cloud systems in general, are well buffered against aerosol changes*. This result will reduce uncertainties in future climate projections, because **we are now able to reject results from climate models with an excessive liquid-water-path response.**

Bjorn Stevens [commented](https://www.nature.com/articles/546483a) on the Malavelle paper:

>Consistent with a growing chorus of other studies^3,4,5,6,7,8,9 , **and in contrast to what is assumed in many climate models**, they find little evidence that clouds mediate a strong aerosol forcing.

(Interesting that his comment was published so soon after Malavelle, et al.)

The third paper was published right around the same time as the Stevens comment ([Sato, et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03379-6)):

>Recent satellite observations, however, have yielded contradictory results: LWP can decrease with increasing aerosol loading. **This difference implies that GCMs overestimate the aerosol effect**, but the reasons for the difference are not obvious.

We have lots of those now. They're likely to get bigger. Unless the geometry of coastal loss actually ends up with them being smaller, I suppose.

The main point probably isn't to eliminate losses, but to mitigate and adapt to them where possible. The combined project of moving future development inland from coastal areas, plus building seawalls for the immovable parts, plus reclaiming some land in highly valuable locations...is solvable over a period of decades via the political process. Technology isn't the main constraint there, it's demand: There just isn't enough demand yet to make a coordinated coastal-management strategy of this type viable.

I tend to agree with the author that desalination is a positive game changer. I sent the same desalination article that the author links to a few friends in recent weeks. One still needs a water source to make that work. 

I have questions about how much nuclear power could be rolled out in a relevant time frame if the political will to do so could be summoned. It may be a practical solution, but it doesn't seem to have many prominent champions at the moment. (Out of curiousity, who are the power brokers behind nuclear power?)

While it's an intelligently crafted article, it's largely an opinion piece with a highly optimistic bias and spin. 

The author concedes that relocation / migration would be cataclysmic  but everything else is relatively straightforward. I would say that the author paints a picture in which the risk of catastrophic climate change is almost nil. 

The scenario painted by the author is one in which we continue ramping up greenhouse emissions in the coming decades. No sense in there of any dangerous threshold that we might pass in terms of emissions, temperatures, feedback mechanisms, etc. His story has no albedo, permafrost, methane hydrates, tropical storms or wars. 

One source of personal optimism for me is the evolution of battery technology which could enable some of the wishes of the ""green jihadis"" the author refers to and lessen the need for nuclear power as part of the solution.

Noteworthy that there is no mention of electrical vehicles in the article which is also a big deal in terms of the overall solution.

It seems that the author's scenario is dependent upon nuclear power, so I would be interested in exploring the scenarios for rolling that out asap. Would this be public sector $$ or private? How does the cost compare with untaxed fossil fuels? Does it require a fossil fuel tax to become price competitive? How many plants? How much money in total? Time to implement?

Ha! No. I actually haven't finished reading it yet. Too busy lately. This was actually mentioned in a recent Scientific American article. 

>I have questions about how much nuclear power could be rolled out in a relevant time frame if the political will to do so could be summoned. 

In my opinion, the only way we will see lots of nuclear power is if we see it produced on a factory line the same way 747s are. The economies of scale that come from mass production just can't be denied. This means we are very likely going to have to move away from pressurized water reactors toward small modular reactors.

(I will note that Russia claims their breeder reactor is cost competitive now, but I've been taking Russian claims with a grain of salt lately.)

>(Out of curiousity, who are the power brokers behind nuclear power?)

There really aren't any. Big Oil hates nuclear because they love to produce natural gas. Big Coal hates nuclear because they are direct competitors. Big Green hates nuclear because they aren't good at math and have internalized some really bad information. So nuclear development today is mostly done by small start-ups in the west or government research institutions in China, India, or Russia. India's thorium reactor looks promising. My money is on China simply because they've devoted the most resources to advanced nuclear. 

>While it's an intelligently crafted article, it's largely an opinion piece with a highly optimistic bias and spin.

I'll have to finish reading the article to see if I agree. 

>His story has no albedo, permafrost, methane hydrates, tropical storms or wars.

You and I have discussed some of these things. I stand by my claim that food supply is the biggest risk from climate change. It has the potential to cause more death than all other effects of climate change combined. 

The author does discuss that early in the article, and he makes the same point that I've made in past conversations (with others, not with you). A lot of cropland is being misused for biofuel production. This is, in my opinion, much better done in the ocean. I don't think you've conversed with him, but I have had lengthy conversations with /u/Vailhem (a moderator here and in many other subs) about the oceans:

- being the best source for biofuel.

- being a great supplementary source for food and/or agricultural feed. 

He's a pretty busy guy, but I thought I would mention him here in the event he would like to jump in. (I also recommend some of his other subs, like /r/BioChar and /r/UrbanAgriculture.)

>One source of personal optimism for me is the evolution of battery technology...

I'm watching this as well, particular solid state batteries. I tend to think in terms of Amara's Law, which I'll paraphrase as, ""People tend to overestimate a technology in the short term and underestimate it in the long term."" I think that batteries are overhyped in terms of development right now, but I do believe that continued development over the coming decades will make EVs become economically viable. 

(Related to that, I think that batteries and advanced nuclear power are a match made in heaven. When is the best time to charge an EV, on average? At night. This would level out the daily power curve and nuclear works great 24 hours each day.)

>Would this be public sector $$ or private?

The efforts of which I am aware in the US, UK, and Canada are all private sector startups, though the UK has made a policy decision to favor SMRs going forward. (Probably due in part to the massive cost overrun at Hinckley C.)

In India and China, the money is coming from governments at the moment. The Chinese Academy of Sciences claims they have 400 PhDs working on SMRs at the moment.

>How does the cost compare with untaxed fossil fuels?

Robert Hargraves claims that thorium reactors in particular would be cheaper than coal:

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A3HZTWO/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIyiVua8cY

>Does it require a fossil fuel tax to become price competitive? 

Maybe. Natural gas is really cheap right now, but I think it's foolhardy to believe that will always be the case. What would help it more is restructuring how we do regulation. There's a reason ThorCon moved to Indonesia to start work on MSRs, and it wasn't the price of fossil fuels. https://clearpath.org/jay-and-richs-take/nuclear-innovation-isnt-welcome-here/

""But before building his first plant to test the idea, Jack faced a choice.

""1. Build in America. It would take 10 years and cost around $500 million, including roughly $100 million in fees to get it approved by the NRC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

""2. Build in Asia. Get it approved to build in 4 years. Save millions.""

>How many plants? 

If you go the SMR route, and using 747s as an example, you could roll a reactor off the factor line every day. That's in just one factory. Each SMR would probably be (and this is a pretty wild guess), in the low hundreds of megawatts of electrical capacity. 

>How much money in total? 

A number I've heard cited by John Kutsch for a test reactor is $100 million. That's less than 1% of what we've spent on ITER so far.

To imply that other countries, particularly those that are large and landlocked should be able to deal with their water issues as easily as Israel is somewhat misleading. 

From a macro standpoint, I'm going to make an inference about your position.

You believe that nuclear is an essential part of the ultimate solution to the climate problem while acknowledging that it presently doesn't have powerful backing in the US. 

In my opinion, the political left is poised to take over in the US in coming decades and climate change solutions will be demanded in 2021. We're likely to have 3 more years of progressively shitty data coming from the weather channel between now and then and the present din will be come an uproar. 

To whatever extent solar and wind can be forecasted to be effective, that will probably come first. I'll be expecting a 10 figure infrastructure plan to be voted on in 2021. 

China's building a test reactor would probably be a good thing in terms of creating visibility for the US to follow that path. I'll trust that future versions of nuclear power generation will be less accident prone than past ones.

>In my opinion, the political left is poised to take over in the US in coming decades and climate change solutions will be demanded in 2021. 

I don't see it happening. I think the populism that Trump exploited hasn't run its course yet. What's more, the Left doesn't have any sort of vision. If their message going forward is ""Anything but him,"" they will continue to lose and wonder why. 

Climate Change, in particular, isn't as large a deal many on the Left believe. For example: http://westernwire.net/outdoor-industry-environmental-groups-lay-out-2018-political-campaign-strategies-after-admitting-green-agenda-lost-on-voters-in-previous-election/

“In the last presidential election on election night we interviewed over 2,000 voters and asked them, ‘Other than personal characteristics, what were the issues?’ And they could say, literally, any issue...""

“**Only 2 percent** named anything relating to the environment in terms of having any bearing at all on their presidential vote. **That included climate change**, that included public lands, that included anything related to the environment. **So if it’s only 2 percent, you’re never going to change those policies**...""

In my opinion, the Left has an identity crisis. They pay lip service to equality while fellating Wall Street. They claim to care about climate change, but oppose nuclear power. They claim to care about the working class while doing everything in their power to promote offshoring and automation. What's more, they whine. Oh my god, do they whine. Hillary Clinton is perhaps the perfect embodiment of the modern Left. Why did she lose? She'll give you 50 reasons, 49 of which were not her fault. Until the Left figures its shit out, it's going to be a long series of dashed hopes. 

(Lest you think I'm a conservative, I'm not. I'm about as apolitical as one gets. I am a curious observer that doesn't fit well into any particular political box.)

>I'll trust that future versions of nuclear power generation will be less accident prone than past ones.

That's a funny thing to say since nuclear power is the safest form of power we've ever had in terms of Joules actually produced. When it fails, though, it's pretty scary. Much like airplanes in that regard.

Some editorial. As someone who is relatively new to the topic of climate change, it was somewhat normal that I would wander over the subreddit with this name. 

The masthead says this is a place to discuss the science of climate change, but it's not necessarily a robust community of climate science discussion. You seem to believe that climate change is real and you have a lot of energy for the nuclear power solution. I applaud that and certainly would be willing to flip the switch to nuclear yesterday in order to stop the greenhouse gas accumulation. After his 2016 visit to Antarctica, John Kerry announced that he was no longer anti-nuclear. I'd like to think that others can be persuaded to make the same transition. 

A big part of what makes climate change interesting is the danger that it poses. Our Darwinian instincts guide us to perpetually analyze risk and try and protect ourselves and our kids from it. The world is sending a strong signal about climate related risk and I'm trying to explore it fully. That includes reckoning with the dark possibilities. 

The earth has experienced greenhouse gas levels this high in this past and there is no evidence to suggest that these levels are compatible with a mixture of life that is favorable to humans. The limited evidence we do have suggests otherwise. The dark possibilities associated with climate change cannot be scientifically dismissed as paranoia. There is merit in pursuing their veracity.

The vibe I am picking up at this sub is that exploration of the dark possibilities is not welcome. I'm not a mind reader as to why that occurs, but I can see where the conversation comes to a halt and I can see some of the bullying associated with labeling concerns as alarmism.

The position of yourself, the author you cited and a few of the regs here suggest that it's not that urgent. To paraphrase, there will be pain, but nothing too bad. 

In the absence of certainty, it seems to me that the wisest course of action is to err on the side of caution. 

There is some dissonance I'm picking up here. On the one hand, the climate threat is real and nuclear power is the best treatment and the other message is that it's not an urgent threat that requires immediate action.

Let's explore this a bit. I will, for the sake of discussion, argue that the present ice age is generally not compatible to human wellbeing. I cite the Toba Catastrophe 70,000 years ago during the most recent glacial period, which likely (though not conclusively) nearly wiped humans out. As of 50,000 years ago, humans were down to between 1,000 and 10,000 individuals *planetwide*. 

The interglacials in the present ice age are quite short relative to the glacial periods. The present interglacial is already longer than several past interglacial periods, where the glacial periods usually last 80,000 to 100,000 years. Life is difficult during those times, for plants and animals alike. During the depths of the most recent glacial period, CO2 dropped so low as to stunt plant growth.

Thus, for the sake of discussion, I posit that the worst thing that could happen to humanity would be a return to glacial conditions. 

>The dark possibilities associated with climate change cannot be scientifically dismissed as paranoia. There is merit in pursuing their veracity.

I suggest extending that pursuit to a return to glacial conditions as well.

>The vibe I am picking up at this sub is that exploration of the dark possibilities is not welcome. 

Exploration is fine. The problem is that when people state that $(dark_possibility) has been declared by scientists to be imminent. In fact, scientists have been abused by climate activists for years. A climate scientist might, for example, acknowledge that the probability for $(dark_possibility) to occur is not zero, and climate activists (and scientifically illiterate journalists, but I repeat myself) claim that such a thing is likely to happen! 

>I'm not a mind reader as to why that occurs, 

Because some of us believe in the integrity of science and not allowing it to be misused for propaganda purposes.

>but I can see where the conversation comes to a halt and I can see some of the bullying associated with labeling concerns as alarmism.

Puh-lease. Try this. Go to most any reddit forum and pose as a climate skeptic. You'll see what bullying is actually like. 

>Considering the dark possibilities associated with climate change gives rise to the urgency necessary to treat it.

Considering all possibilities is fine, but climate change doesn't get a pass when it comes to assigning probabilities. A life taken by something related to climate change is no more precious than a life taken by some other preventable event. There is a bad habit among climate activists to downplay other problems we have to deal with, and it harms their credibility.

>The position of yourself, the author you cited and a few of the regs here suggest that it's not that urgent. 

On the contrary, it is the hypocrites of Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, the WWF, Friends of the Earth, etc. that aren't treating it as an urgent problem, as their anti-nuclear position clearly reveals. How do you think their opposition to nuclear power has affected the climate debate?

>Considering the dark possibilities associated with climate change gives rise to the urgency necessary to treat it.

Why does it get special treatment compared to all the other bad things that could happen? As a room full of virologists if they think climate change is the most urgent problem facing humanity. This has been done, by the way. Not a single person in the room said it was. They said that pandemic is a far bigger threat. 

I can give you a laundry list of things that are ""dark possibilities"". How should we devote our limited resources to solving them all?

But your point is flawed, beyond that. You believe that consideration of ""dark possibilities"" leads to urgency. It doesn't. It leads to crisis fatigue, which often leads to apathy. And in cases where ""dark possibilities"" don't come about as predicted, it leads to a loss of confidence in those going on and on about ""dark possibilities"". It's The Boy Who Cried Wolf Syndrome. It's already bitten climate activists, so I encourage you to take a step back and consider the ironic downside to that sort of emphasis on ""dark possibilities"".

>In the absence of certainty, it seems to me that the wisest course of action is to err on the side of caution.

That's a two-edged sword. It also applies to making changes to energy and economic systems.

>On the one hand, the climate threat is real and nuclear power is the best treatment and the other message is that it's not an urgent threat that requires immediate action.

Then you might want to ask yourself if you are putting words in my mouth. I'll share with you my plan, below the break, for decarbonizing the world over the next several decades.

I give you Will_Power's *Plan to Replace All Fossil Fuels by 2076*™. As the plan is long and time is short, here are some key elements in bullet form:

- The cornerstone is advanced nuclear power. This begins with a focus on removing restrictions to R&D by revamping the NRC, plus spending public funds to match private investment funds. 

- Fission is the focus for the first phase, particularly breeders reactors that can consume existing nuclear waste stockpiles. 

- Brayton Cycle research receives funding as well in order to allow advanced reactors to operate at higher temperatures (this is a good thing from a thermodynamics perspective) in order to massively reduce water requirements.

As these plants become commercialized:

- Desalination plants are built near coastal cities. As their water needs are met with desalinated sea water, upstream water can be returned to previous uses, including growing forests.

- Some surplus nighttime power charges EVs.

- Other surplus nighttime heat and power is used to synthesize hydrocarbons as the US Navy has demonstrated (and as was done with the Fischer-Tropsch process clear back in WWII).

- Waste heat runs steam plants for centralized heating of cities and towns.

- PRT systems like /r/SkyTran start to replace personal vehicles.

- Existing hydropower plants become huge energy storage systems as advanced nuclear displaces them for baseload. This aids intermittent sources like solar and wind.

Other:

- Solar and wind are built in areas of high insolation and stable winds, respectively,  *and where embraced by local residents*.

- Mob grazing is used to enrich topsoil, which also sequesters carbon.

- /r/Biochar is produced and used to sequester carbon in topsoil.

- Fusion research is pursued at a later date.

Let's stay on-topic. The existence of *current* sources of funding isn't especially relevant for projects in *future decades*.

Probably the most likely future source of funding for any large future infrastructure project is a public-private partnership. I'm not especially well-versed in these structures, but complex financing projects involving many cash streams definitely have a big future for large projects. I can't identify exactly how private lenders will receive their promised payoffs here — do seawalls have users who pay user fees/tolls? But I don't think solving this problem is beyond the scope of human financial ingenuity. 

>The question was more along the lines of who finances the debt spending of the US gov't. Do we just assume that China buys US Treasuries forever?

It's reasonable to assume that many other countries' financial authorities will seek Treasury-type investments in the future, and their combined investment scale will probably dwarf China's. As long as China's currency remains unconvertible, the world's reserve currency will probably still be the dollar, and thus Treasurys will garner the lion's share of these sovereign investments. 

When the yuan becomes as freely convertible as the dollar, then this picture changes. But that probably won't happen without placing a tremendous stress on the Chinese and probably world economies.

Ha, well, that's an economic forecast under one set of assumptions. 

Deficit spending is a fairly common tool in the sovereign financial arsenal. The wisdom of it is usually determined by 1) The ability of nations to invest the borrowed funds in durable, productive assets, and 2) The costs of borrowing.

I'm not bold enough to make a properly supported forecast of sovereign borrowing costs past 2050 (or really, past 2025). But if you have a forecast, this would be a good place to bring it up. 

>Who is going to have a surplus to buy Treasury's?

Regarding your statement that falsely accused you. You neglect to identify which statement that I made was false. I'm attaching a quote of a contribution you made to a thread (Are We Drastically Underestimating Climate Change?) 16 days ago.

""The IPCC represents the current consensus among climate scientists. Whenever you read the phrase ""the IPCC is too conservative,"" be sure that the person saying/writing it is an alarmist who can't back their claims with actual scientific research.""

The quote above coming from your account is a fact. 

In the latest IPCC reports, their estimates of sea level rise included zero contribution from ice melt in Greenland and Antarctica by 2100 because they couldn't agree on a model. The result was an upper bound of SLR estimate of < 1m. My calling out the IPCC as being conservative for omitting Greenland and Antarctica is not ""alarmist"". It is an obvious criticism and low hanging fruit. 

To your claim that people who criticize the IPCC can't offer scientific research to back their claim....I have offered a presentation which I believes reflects the state of the art in understanding sea level rise. 
I'll share it again here. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAPPq43iRLs

The presentation is from a genuine NASA physicist and one of the world's prominent glaciologists and represents the accumulation of understanding of multitudes of scientists who are applying themselves to understand this aspect of the climate change threat. 
It is mainstream. 

You state that claims outside of mainstream climate science need to be labelled as such. To their credit, the IPCC does not claim that there will be no net melt from Greenland and Antarctica. They just didn't feel comfortable putting a number on it. 

Your assertion that I'm being passive aggressive has zero merit. I'm being as direct as I possibly can with my criticism. 

If you want to maximize the influence of your ideas, you might want to consider making some adjustments.

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,e0j7bip,TheMercian,,"I'll stick to the bits I know best. When it comes to arable land... there's a lot more nuance to the question of whether climate change will increase net arable land, even in the article you've linked:

>South America may lose 1–21&#37; of its arable land area, Africa 1–18&#37;, Europe 11–17&#37;, and India 2–4&#37;. When considering, in addition, land used for human settlements and natural conservation, the net potential arable land may decrease even further worldwide by the end of the 21st century under both scenarios due to population growth.

Also, arable land \- by itself \- doesn't feed people. Crops and farmers to farm them do. Trade regimes also play as role, as [Stevanovic et al](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/8/e1501452.full). note:

>By estimating the changes in surpluses of consumers and producers, we find that climate change can have detrimental impacts on global agricultural welfare, especially after 2050, because losses in consumer surplus generally outweigh gains in producer surplus. Damage in agriculture may reach the annual loss of 0.3&#37; of future total gross domestic product at the end of the century globally, assuming further opening of trade in agricultural products, which typically leads to interregional production shifts to higher latitudes. Those estimated global losses could increase substantially if international trade is more restricted.

As for plants, the CO2 fertilisation effect often gets grossly oversimplified \- most plants in the tropics won't benefit from increased concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere [where there is a step\-wise increase in temperature](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1005542414134). What people also forget is that any benefit to crops is a benefit to their [diseases ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526616301054)as well.

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,e0j83id,Hatsuwr,,"Yup, that article definitely isn't making very specific claims. Seems to make a strong argument that in certain scenarios, an increase is possible.

The paper I've cited in my response shows 'diminishing returns' to CO2 enrichment with concomitant temperature increase in rice, which is the most important grain crop. There comes a point when increased temperature drowns-out any benefit of elevated CO2. It's also not as straightforward as ""more CO2 = more growth"", because you also have to factor in water use and nutrient use (i.e. if the plant breathes more it also needs more nitrogen and H2O to support respiration). The effect of climate change on hydrology might actually be the most important factor to crop productivity.

There's also three major groups of plants (C3, C4 and CAM). These categories refer to how they 'fix' carbon and each type responds differently to elevated temperatures - C4 maize, for instance, has a higher optimum temperature for photosynthesis than wheat. However, net photosynthesis for maize declines at [leaf temperatures beyond 38°C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC166765/) suggesting that crops grown in the tropics are already closer to their productive 'ceiling' than others. That said, a recent [paper](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6386/317.full) throws a lot of this into contention. Germination is another factor affected by temperature.

The IPCC said in AR5 that transient climate response (TCR) is 1.8°C. That means the temperature increase at the time CO2 doubles from an arbitrary staring point. So from 280 ppm to 560 ppm would be one doubling. That might occur towards the end of this century. 

If we use 400 ppm as a starting point (the concentration a couple of years ago), we need to get to 800 ppm to get an additional 1.8°C from now, at the time of doubling. The problem with that, though, is that we don't have enough economically extractable fossil fuel reserves to get to 800 ppm.

>I have seen some redditors claim that it could rise by as much as 5 - 6C particularly on /r/ Collpase.

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,e1rhuhc,buddhist62,,"My off the cuff comments.

I think the biggest wild card for temperature increase is feedback effects associated with Arctic methane deposits. Research suggests that events associated with the PETM (Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum) of 52-53M years ago involved substantial release of these deposits into the atmosphere and resulted in a much hotter (+6C), relatively ice free world. 

Paleo-climate records indicate that current anthropogenic forcing is proceeding much faster than the forcing preceding the PETM, but to this point over a much shorter interval. 

The most important question relating to potential Arctic methane release is how much Arctic temperatures increase. They are well above the global average thus far. 

The 2014 study led by Karen Pistone indicates the loss of albedo in the Arctic alone is thus far providing additional warming of 50% of that associated with cumulative global anthropogenic emissions. 

In a scenario in which there is no significant methane release from the Arctic, then I don't see global average temperature increasing much more than 1.0-1.5C from today's levels this century. My hunch is that annual emissions would peak in 20 years and CO2 would ultimately peak in the 500-550 ppm range before declining. 

It may not sound like a lot, but another 1C from today is a profound jump. That 1C isn't going to be distributed evenly over time and space and the new extremes associated with that should be highly consequential for the quality and diversity for life on earth.

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,e1runx7,skeeezoid,,"Firstly, you need to define your baseline. In the industrial era we've seen about 1ºC warming already. Some warming projections concern change from now (or from about 2000), some concern change ""since pre-industrial"" (meaning since about 1850), which effectively means change from now + 1ºC.

Based on the CMIP5 models used in the IPCC assessment, warming ""since pre-industrial"" under a high-end minimal-mitigation scenario (RCP8.5) - meaning continued strong growth in energy demand with little change in percentage of that demand satisfied by fossil fuel burning - reaches about 3.5-6ºC by 2100, with the range largely due to uncertainty in climate sensitivity.

Under a strong mitigation scenario - meaning drastic reduction in emissions starting now - warming ""since pre-industrial"" reaches about 1-2.5ºC by 2100.

Beyond 2100, under a high-end scenario in which emissions only begin to reduce at a gradual pace around the mid-22nd Century (due to resource shortages rather than mitigation), warming ""since pre-industrial"" reaches about 6-15ºC by 2300. Under the strong mitigation scenario 2300 temperatures are about 1-2ºC warmer than pre-industrial.

As another comparison, under a minimal-mitigation low-end scenario (RCP6.0) - in which emissions start slowing from 2070 and GHG concentration stop increasing at 2150, there is only one model that I can find which was run to 2300. Luckily that model is right in the middle of the range for climate sensitivity. By 2100, warming ""since pre-industrial"" reaches 3.5ºC. By 2300 it's at 4.5ºC. Using the other results we can make an educated guess at equivalent uncertainty ranges of 2-5ºC and 2.5-7ºC respectively.

Should note that none of these model projections include so-called Earth System Sensitivity (ESS) feedbacks, such as ice sheet albedo loss and carbon cycle shifts, which paleoclimate observations suggest should enhance warming in the long run. Probably not important for 2100, but likely to be for 2300 and beyond.",2018-07-04T11:47:38+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Imagine we killed half a billion people through something like genocide or war. Now imagine if unaffected people casually asked, “Yea, but what about the benefits? Fewer people equals less demand for resources and less pollution. What about other positives?” It would seem crass, right? 

Additionally, it also reminds me of discussing the benefits of getting terminally ill. You’ll lose weight. You won’t have to go to work. People will come visit you in the hospital. All positives on their own, right? But focusing on the positives completely misses the broader context of what’s happening, which is that you’re dying. You don’t need to know the positives to figure out that it’s not worth getting terminally ill. 

Climate change is going to be an enormous negative for billions of people on the planet. Many will be killed because of it, and many will see their homes rendered unlivable or much more dangerous due to extreme weather. Carbon pollution may provoke ecosystem collapse and economic calamity. It may provoke mass migration and political upheaval in additional to famine and disease. And meanwhile, it will have been a handful of rich industrial countries that did the most damage while poorer less culpable countries will be most affected. 

So idly sitting back and discussing the “benefits” of new shipping lanes or new farmland in Canada or Siberia doesn’t appropriately discount that stuff relative to the overwhelming negatives. Those things might be true. They may be facts. They may benefit a few people. But framing them as “benefits” for humanity reveals a lack of appreciation of the context and the great suffering that billions of people may experience if we don’t get a lid on this thing.

Climatechange,post,agriculture,933127,Jirachi93,How climate change affects Germany this year,"Hey guys!

I just wanted to share what is going on in Germany at the moment. In fact we have one of the hottest and longest summers ever.

It began in may with temperatures above 25°C. A normal summer would be between 20-25°C over here. Rarely we have about 30°C and 40°C is a total exception for a few days. Since about may the temperatures were constantly above those 25°C. That lasted for about a whole month before we had about 1 1/2 weeks of cooler weather and a little bit of rain. But since about the beginning of june it is back and we now have temperatures above 28°C every single day until the present day. The last two weeks have been at least at 30-32°C on a daily basis. Last week we reached the first peak of 37°C while the other days were around 32°C-35°C on average. Upday just infomed me that this week we will get 38°C and it might be past the 40°C mark at some point and there is no end in sight.

The consequences are devastating. As our flora is used to a very different climate of 17°C to 25°C on average everything that once was green turned brown like hay cause it has been burnt out by the sun. Agricultural fields are burning on a daily basis. People can't function properly anymore and I have to think very hard if we had more than 3 rain days in total or when was the last time I slept more than 6 hours and not waking up on 8am due to the heat that is present already. I am self employed so I normally get up at 10am and get to bed at around 2am if you are confused. 

Yesterday I turned the radio on and it was the big news of the month that we had some rain all over Germany for about 2 minutes in total. Also because of the heat we didn't have rich harvests at all and are in a lack of potatoes (no stereotypical jokes please) and therefore fries are now officially shorter and will be more expensive. Some villages alredy start to ration their water because their water pump facilities start to have problems delivering enough water to the citizens. 

This really reminds me of Interstellar as we already took the first step into that direction I suppose. 

I am also kind of worried about how it ends. You certainly know what happens in Africa when there has been a huge draught and then it rains so heavily that the whole land will be flooded. And in the past we already had some serious floods after only two weeks of a draught. Also If I remember correctly the claimate change functions both ways. Hot summers and bitter cold winters right?

Im outside a lot and see zero devastation. Ok, most of the grass turned brown but other than that ...

> As our flora is used to a very different climate of 17°C to 25°C on average 

Our flora isnt only used to an average but also to a standard deviation. Weather and climate have been variable since the beginning of time. 

> everything that once was green turned brown like hay cause it has been burnt out by the sun. Agricultural fields are burning on a daily basis. 

I just made a bicycle tour through a rural area and there was nothing burning and still lots of green. 

> People can't function properly anymore and I have to think very hard if we had more than 3 rain days in total or when was the last time I slept more than 6 hours and not waking up on 8am due to the heat that is present already. 

I live under the roof where it's the hottest, 40°+ at day and 35° at night the last week. Im self-employed like you which allows me to take time to keep physically active like cycling and swimming. When I feel too hot I drink hot tea, makes me sweat like a hog and cools me off instantly. Cold drinks dont cool you, on the contrary, you only become addicted. Also you need to replenish the salt you sweat out. I love the Turkish drink Ayran (joghurt with water and salt) or salty soups. Many people make the mistake of eating less (combined with physical inactivity). No surprise they stop functioning properly. 

> Yesterday I turned the radio on and it was the big news of the month that we had some rain all over Germany for about 2 minutes in total. Also because of the heat we didn't have rich harvests at all 

Grain harvest should better than average because of good weather. Only produce that require lots of water are worse than average. 

> and are in a lack of potatoes (no stereotypical jokes please) and therefore fries are now officially shorter and will be more expensive. 

Sounds like a great occasion to try healthier food. 

> I am also kind of worried about how it ends. You certainly know what happens in Africa when there has been a huge draught and then it rains so heavily that the whole land will be flooded.

All this has little to do with climate or climate change. Youre talking about local weather and its variability.

I remember well when the alarmists predicted snow-less alps. How would cold winters even make sense to begin with?

Thanks for commenting on everything. At least for the harvests I found articles that those would be 40% less rich than in the last year in Bremen and all across Niedersachsen it would be more likely 60% for the grain harvest you say wouldn't be affected at all. Also because the animals don't get enough food they don't produce enough milk anymore and also chickens and pigs suffer from the heat.

Some even had to completely close down due to the heat.

As it is all across Germany and also in the Netherlands I wouldn't really call that local weather. Also yesterday I went all the way down from Hamburg to Rheinland Pfalz and everything that was supposed to be green turned brown. In cities aswell as in rural areas. Trees even got rid of brown leafs that dried out. I also went to the west coast of the Netherlands to cool down in the sea a little bit and the same phenomenon was present along the way.

I didn't say that I am eating fries all the time but my point was that it should be alarming that we seem to run out of potatoes.

The cold winter thing was something I heard back in middle school. Like when there are hot summers the climate tries to get the equilibrium back by measures of cold winters. Also according to this article from the Süddeutsche Zeitung cold winters and climate change are no real contradiction. I guess you are from Germany as well at least it reads that way so you will remember having -10+°C last winter which also was above average. At least for the 26 winters I witnessed so far.

About heat waves wikipedia says that there is no real definition for that.

[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitzewelle](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitzewelle)

 However it says that it is supposed to be 30+°C but not less than 25°C for a single day. So we actually have a heat wave for at least two full months according to that definition. I was just pointing out that the temperatures we are facing currently only were present for a few days in a row in the past 26 summers and now we have it constantly for 2 months straight which certainly is a big difference.",2018-07-30T12:23:15+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

>Recent research has strengthened the understanding of the links between climate and tropical cyclones (TCs) on various timescales. Geological records of past climates have shown century‐long variations in TC numbers. While no significant trends have been identified in the Atlantic since the late 19th century, significant observed trends in TC numbers and intensities have occurred in this basin over the past few decades, and trends in other basins are increasingly being identified. However, understanding of the causes of these trends is incomplete, and confidence in these trends continues to be hampered by a lack of consistent observations in some basins. A theoretical basis for maximum TC intensity appears now to be well established, but a climate theory of TC formation remains elusive. Climate models mostly continue to predict future decreases in global TC numbers, projected increases in the intensities of the strongest storms and increased rainfall rates.

Yes for many parts in Germany this summer is unusual dry. Yes thats not good. But you cant account this to climate change. Is it most likely related to climate yes, but should we use personal storys to say ""How climate change affects germany this year"" hell no. Thats a big no-go. 

Just think how you would have written your text with last summer in mind.

And heres a list with everything thats wrong in my opinion.          
 


>It began in may with temperatures above 25°C. A normal summer would be between 20-25°C over here. Rarely we have about 30°C 
Wrong. 
       
A normal summer has plenty of days with more than 25°C and still many with more than 30°C

         Years with the most days which had more than 30°C:
    Bremen:
            1. 17 1947
            2. 15 1994
            3. 15 1976
            4. 13 1911
            5. 12 2006  
            Mean 5
    Munich:
            1. 33 2015
            2. 31 2003
            3. 21 2017
            4. 19 1994
            5. 18 2006
            Mean: 8

    Mean days wiith more than 25°C Degrees in:
           Bremen:
        28
        Munich:
        46

>Since about may the temperatures were constantly above those 25°C.

Also wrong, but could be right depending on which part in Germany you are, and if you take the 25°C not very seriuos.

 >But since about the beginning of june it is back and we now have temperatures above 28°C every single day until the present day.

Wrong: Munich for example had at the start of July exactly 0 days with more than 30 degrees, and about 30 days of more than 25°C.

>The last two weeks have been at least at 30-32°C on a daily basis

Might be true for wherever you live. The south (Bavaria) didnt even reach 30°C in the last two weeks until yesterday.

> Last week we reached the first peak of 37°C while the other days were around 32°C-35°C on average.

Some places in the west reached the peak. Places south didnt even reach 32°C

>just infomed me that this week we will get 38°C and it might be past the 40°C mark at some point and there is no end in sight.

That we might get up to 38°, 40° is very very unlikely and some places will stay at about 30. Looking at you again southern Germany.


>The consequences are devastating. As our flora is used to a very different climate of 17°C to 25°C on average everything that once was green turned brown like hay cause it has been burnt out by the sun. Agricultural fields are burning on a daily basis

So that may be for your place, but e.g. the south again is quite fine.

>People can't function properly anymore and I have to think very hard if we had more than 3 rain days in total or when was the last time I slept more than 6 hours and not waking up on 8am due to the heat that is present already

People are also to stubborn to drink enough water or use fans. Most of society is still working fine.      
The south is also pretty on target with the fallen rain for May and June.

>Yesterday I turned the radio on and it was the big news of the month that we had some rain all over Germany for about 2 minutes in total

Thats just plain bullshit / very bad practice of ur radio station (Bild Niveau ;) )

Yes I live in western Germany. But I am talking to people all over Germany on a daily basis. This is the case for NRW, Niedersachsen, Brandenburg, Rheinland Pfalz, Sachsen, Hessen and Saarland at least. In Sachsen-Anhalt it is 39,3°C today which is very close to the all time record of 40°C. All of that is a major part of Germany to my understanding and not just some places in the west. And yes in the past 8 weeks it really just rained for 2 minutes total over here and we have temperatures above 30-32°C on a daily basis for the same period of time. It may be different down in Bavaria but also a friend down near the border of Austria keeps telling me that it would rain all day every day. So your location could be an exception and can't be transfered to the rest of Germany and only some cities in the west being the exception as all those regions I mentioned are suffering from the continuous heat.

And if you have a look at the temperatures this year you will see that we are way past that mark of 28 days above 25°C. In fact we might even be close to 75 at this point of time. So that is quite the difference. Also if I look up the weather in the west for this week every single day of the week is at least at 30°C with the peak of 35°C on friday again and just like I said it is that way since at least beginning to mid june.

Somewhere along the way I was introduced to the idea of enhanced weathering.. Is there a decent body of research on the topic?  is it generally supported? 



 [Enhanced weathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_weathering) refers to
> ""geoengineering approaches that use the dissolution of natural or artificially created minerals to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Since the carbon dioxide is usually first removed from ocean water, these approaches would attack the problem by first reducing ocean acidification. ""

Not long ago i stumbled upon [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-018-0108-y.epdf?author_access_token=w1xYBFb3g3BwKnjkBD1cJtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NSaZpth7Zz94N6_lHXNgths4xErTsML30mZS8Ql0FCuzY9k6ePi5nMsoEvmCXoU5g65l-c0C09tp3iWQMGMdfvbuwlRhm5_snv9tqy8Kc6ig%3D%3D), which states 

>The aim of enhanced weathering is to accelerate the natural geological process of carbon sequestration with the production of alkaline leachate that reduces ocean acidification. It is achieved by modifying the soils of intensively managed croplands with crushed calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg)bearing rocks. 

and 

>Significant potential exists for large-scale deployment of ground 
basalt to remove atmospheric CO2.

and argues that there could be significant secondary benefits from the whole process..

>Besides removing CO2 from the atmosphere, we discuss how this strategy has the potential to also rejuvenate soils, stabilize soil organic matter, improve crop yields, conserve geological fertilizer resources and benefit the marine environment

>Adding crushed silicates to soils... will probably have further economic benefit due to their ability to help replenish eroded soil and enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) content, both serious global concerns threatening food security

_

>Cation release from basalt weathering increases the cation exchange capacity of soils and nutrient availability and could improve SOC sequestration by resulting in higher inputs of organic carbon from roots and mycorrhizal fungi, which themselves promote soil aggregate formation and SOC stability

_

>Enhanced weathering strategies not only capture carbon but 
could also help to restore soils and resupply impoverished reserves 
of trace elements that are important for human nutrition and crop 
production

_

>..enhanced silicate weathering can be expected to increase dissolved 
silica fluxes to rivers and oceans. This may partially help to mitigate 
the effects of N and P in runoff from agricultural regions. Increased 
Si:N and/or Si:P ratios in runoff reaching coastal waters from soils 
amended with silicates might favour the growth of diatoms over prob
lematic non-siliceous algae that produce toxins, red tides (dinoflagellate blooms), foam (Phaeocystis blooms) and scum (cyanobacterial blooms). Such a changed nutrient balance could also beneficially preserve or increase downstream food web and fisheries production because diatoms are the preferred diet of pelagic and benthic grazers, mostly copepods and bivalves, and increase marine biological CO2 drawdown and storage with economic benefits in particular regions. For example, the Great Barrier Reef is adjacent to the main sugarcane growing regions in Australia, where adding crushed basalt to soils may not only enhance sugarcane production, but also improve runoff and ground water chemistry while countering ocean acidity via the addition of alkaline leachate..

The paper argues that there could be a slew of potential benefits from a simple, albeit resource and labor intensive, process... A lot of potential benefit.  Is there a good catalog of research available? I know about the group Remineralize the Earth, which funds small projects and research, but their list of research is largely non-peer reviewed and largely from non-english speaking countries.  Anybody have any thoughts on the topic?

As such from what I can see any carbon emitted as gases into the atmosphere by for example a cow, has to initially come from the atmosphere, being used by grass to grow that then the cow eats and turns into gases it releases, that then later again is used by grass to grow. As such this seems to me to be akin to a renewable cycle. As such I have an issue to see how agriculture contributes to climate change, because it doesn't add any new Carbon to the Carbon Cycle, it's just part of the normal Carbon Cycle.

Forest clearance (e.g. Amazon and Indonesian rainforests initially logged for timber, then used to grow crops, then abandoned because the soil is not stable once its protective canopy of trees and plants are removed, turning it to desert. You only have to stand in the shade of a tree to feel the temperature is cooler than in the shade of a building, due to transpiration. Also Google map the island of Haiti / Dominican Republic to see what deforestation for timber and agriculture does to land.

Western agriculture (monoculture) involves huge inputs of fertilisers, pestisides all of which are made from fossil fuels or mined; add to that fuel to manufacture huge machinery from steel and fuel to use the machinery to harvest grain, much of which is fed to methane-producing livestock at a ratio of around 7:1 - huge carbon footprint. Much agriculture relies on irrigation, depleting rivers, reservoirs and aquifers. Add to that loss of biological diversity, increasing diseases and plant predation (World wide, the cotton boll weevil, aphids, locusts and other plagues of pests), leading to greater use of pesticides. Transporting the products of agriculture around the world uses marine diesel, lorry diesel or aviation fuel (lamb from New Zealand to UK, avocados from Chile etc) Then consider the billions of tonnes of wasted food - 7.3 million tonnes in UK in 2015 and it will be more now, most of which ends up in landfill, emitting methane gas (30 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere).

Some of the non-gaseous byproducts of these bacteria are taken up and incorporated into the bodies of plants, which are then consumed again. Same goes for the inedible byproducts, just without the animal step and straight to decomposing bacteria. 

There are a lot of good reasons listed by others here as to why industrial farming adds carbon to the cycle but here's one I've come across before that I haven't seen anyone mention yet:

Industrial management of the soil (frequent tilling, chemical fertilizers, etc.) causes the number and diversity of soil bacteria to drop. This not only reduces the ability of the land itself to lock in carbon (through the bacteria), but also destabilizes the nutritional quality of the soil thus requiring farmers to use more and more artificial (and carbon-intensive) fertilization methods to maintain soil nutritional content.

It's been estimated that the loss of soil organic matter (SOM) from changes in land use (including destruction of forests as C sinks) accounts for ~50 GtC (GtC = billion tons of carbon) since the start of the industrial revolution. Given that we've released a total of ~400-600 GtC over that period from all anthropogenic sources, that puts the total impact at around ~10%, which is pretty much in line with the EPA's estimated 9% of total annual carbon emissions. Based on the EPA's numbers, this is ~1/3 of the emissions that come from transportation (28%) or electricity generation (28%) and ~2x the emissions from residential energy use (5%). So it's a big source, but definitely not the biggest.

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,e3t15k1,notoriouslysmall,,"To answer your question about the carbon cycle... Yes, there is a constant amount of carbon on earth and it pretty much doesn't change. However, it's not carbon itself that causes global warming it is the greenhouse gases that have carbon in them that causes it. For example, CO2 : 1 carbon and 2 Oxygen is a molecule that is in our atmosphere. The more CO2 we have in the atmosphere, the hotter our atmosphere gets.

The good news is that at some point CO2 gets absorbed by plants and is used to make their leaves and trunks. This takes time as plants can only take back so much CO2 per day.

Fossil fuels (oil, natural gas) sit underground for millions of year and is relatively harmless. It's when we use them that they become bad when burning oil/gas causes CO2 to be expelled into the atmosphere. Ever since the industrial revolution, we have been burning these fossil fuels at such a fast rate that our forests (which are also being cut down) can not keep up with the pace and can't suck in CO2 fast enough.

Jungles are being burnt down and used for agriculture. For example, palm plantations in Indonesia. This causes problems in several ways:

1. Jungles are much more efficient at absorbing CO2 than palm plantations because of the density of jungles and their undergrowth.
2. The act of burning jungles releases CO2 into the atmosphere at much quicker rates than they would if they died naturally.
3. More CO2 in the atmosphere means more heating of the atmosphere

Not all agriculture is bad but here are some that are bad:

1. Cattle release methane (farts and burps) which is 30 times more potent than CO2 as a heat trapping gas. In general, meat and dairy has a much higher carbon footprint than vegetables and fruits. This knowledge is partly causing the vegan trend.
2. Mass agriculture means that the food they produce has to be shipped all around the country in trucks. If people bought local, there would be much less gas used.
3. Food has to be stored, packaged, shipped, processed, transported, prepared and served. At every stage, these release greenhouse gases because every stage uses energy from fossil fuels. Of course this can be all fixed if we suddenly switched to renewable energy like solar, wind, hydro and geothermal.

Of course we all need agriculture for food. We just have to be smart about it.",2018-08-08T03:55:10+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

* [Here's How America Uses Its Land](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/): Agriculture takes up about a fifth of the country's land, with most of that land being used for pasture/range, livestock feed crops and corn crop for ethanol production.
* [Tackling Climate Change Through Livestock](http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3437e/i3437e00.htm): 14.5 percent of global GHG emissions, or 7.1 gigatons of CO2 equivalent, can be attributed to the livestock sector annually

As for the renewable cycle you asked about, more CO2 is being added to the atmosphere than it being taken out. For example, the forests that would usually absorb the CO2 and produce oxygen are being cut down and cleared to raise methane-producing livestock like cattle. [These forests are not being replaced](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/this-is-how-animal-agriculture-causes-deforestation/) at the same rate they are being cleared.

In animal husbandry, feed conversion ratio (FCR) or feed conversion rate is a ratio or rate measuring of the efficiency with which the bodies of livestock convert animal feed into the desired output. For dairy cows, for example, the output is milk, whereas in animals raised for meat (such as beef cows, pigs, chickens, and fish) the output is the flesh, that is, the body mass gained by the animal, represented either in the final mass of the animal or the mass of the dressed output.  FCR is the mass of the input divided by the output (thus mass of feed per mass of milk or meat). In some sectors, feed efficiency, which is the output divided by the input (i.e.

For certain groups of people, sure, it's possible they'll find some kind of benefit, but on the whole, the changes will cause suffering and be perceived as negative. 

It is possible that further in the future, future human civilization will see some aspects of global warming as positive. However, they will be seeing it from their point of view and not the point of view as the civilization that had to endure the rapid changes. I liken this to post plague, post colonial and post Mongolian invasion societies, which can dispassionately talk about ""benefits"" of those events but which didn't have to withstand the disruption and pain of the events themselves. 

In the same way that I value a dollar today more than a dollar ten years from now, I value living humans over distant future humans. Therefore, I believe global warming should be viewed as primarily negative from that vantage point, and that ""benefits"" shouldn't be described as accruing to humanity as a whole but perhaps to specific groups.

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,e7vd3ad,FireFoxG,,"> What constitutes a better radiator?

If a material can absorb IR better... then is automatically means the atoms will re-emit IR better too. Its a basic fundamental property of physics as atoms move to and from an excited state.

>Cooling causes warming, so CO2 does cause warming by cooling?!

Yes.  The entire atmosphere contracts, which literally lowers the effective surface area that is emitting IR.  The band of IR that are being absorbed by Co2 are completely opaque within a few hundred meters of this surface.  The IR photons going into space from the ground are basically bouncing randomly into other Co2 atoms until the air becomes thin enough that there is a direct path to space.

With more Co2, the transfer rate of IR is actually more efficient because there is proportionally less o2 and n2 to ""slow down"" the IR photons. Basically, the photons are bouncing into everything, and when it hits a Co2 molecule, the photon is re-emitted ""quicker"". Think of it like the difference between aluminum and paper... in the same way that metal wicks away heat better then paper... pure co2 is better at wicking away heat then typical air.

Using a heat sink to demonstrate... imagine a dynamic heatsink that changes size based on how efficient the heat is moved.  Changing the heatsink to aluminum, from paper, causes the heatsink to shrink. The amount it shrinks actually more then counteracts the increased heat flow... making the heatsink worse at actually getting rid of heat from your CPU.",2018-10-16T14:26:36+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Earths radiating temp is around 288 K, which [radiates around 10um.](https://i.gyazo.com/2caa48822732863b58ff71c0300642af.png) Co2's IR absorption band [looks like this.](https://noconsensus.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/image0011.gif)  

The amount of energy is essentially a fixed amount... so the air temp is completely dependent on the efficiency of radiation of the IR to space.  If the ~~heatsink~~ *atmosphere* shrinks its effective surface area... then the amount of energy lost to space goes down.  The ~~heatsink~~ *atmosphere* is shrinking because the ""thermal"" conductivity of the medium increases.

The heatsink analogy is basically exactly how it works... except its made of air which expands and contracts significantly more then aluminum... which causes the outer most surface of it to contract MORE then enough to counteract the increased heat flow.

>Oysters are the Chesapeake Bay's best natural filters. They also provide essential habitat for fish and other Bay creatures.

At the end of the seminar, they will have the option to take home spat-on-shell oysters (baby oysters set on recycled shells) and two 18"" x 10"" cages to grow them in. Gardeners will grow and care for their oysters in the cages for about one year and will return the mature adult oysters to CBF at an Oyster Roundup the following June.

Climatechange,post,agriculture,a5fqwu,Helen003,Plants are Solving Climate Change for Us,"I'm trying to get more people into talking about climate change. I would really appreciate it if you gave me feedback on this article. [https://goo.gl/forms/rizdj6OgHQVTgHq03](https://goo.gl/forms/rizdj6OgHQVTgHq03)

Recently I have stumbled upon two fascinating articles - “The Hidden Life of Trees” by Peter Wohlleben and “Reciprocity” by Janine Benyus. They discuss how forests are interconnected and individual trees and plants help each other survive. This is completely different from what we are used to hearing about how trees compete with each other for resources.

Peter Wohlleben realizes that there are advantages for trees to working together. “A tree is not a forest. On its own, a tree cannot establish a consistent local climate. It is at the mercy of wind and weather. But together, many trees create an ecosystem that moderates extremes of heat and cold, stores a great deal of water, and generates a great deal of humidity.” It shows how the cooperation between trees has more advantages than competition. When one single tree is sick, others will support it. Wohlleben compares it to a herd of elephants, “Like the her, they, too, look after their own, and they help their sick and weak back up onto their feet. They are even reluctant to abandon their dead.” The dead refers to the tree stump that was kept alive for at least four or five hundred years. And as is known, trees help sequester carbon into the soil and keep it in there for centuries. “Every tree, therefore, is valuable to the community and worth keeping around for as long as possible.” Even more, trees aren’t just connected to each other. They are also cooperating with other plants. For example, while Janine Benyus was working in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, she noticed that grass under the blue oaks was thriving. It is as if oaks were nurturing it and helping it grow.

However, this idea of mutualism in the forest was not always popular. In 1900s, Frederic Clements proposed this idea. Even though he was very famous at that time, his ideas were replaced by Henry Gleason who argued for the competition perspective. Being compared to Clements became one of the biggest admonitions and “a sure sign of naivete.” But his perspective started coming around lately again because of the facts that scientists could not ignore anymore - trees and plants do cooperate.

It has been found that roots of the trees connect to each other and share resources. Simard defined “Wood Wide Web” as “an underground Internet through which water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and defense compounds are exchanged.” It can be argued that it happens because trees’ roots grow in different directions and connect by accident. However, Massimo Maffei from the University of Turin showed that plants are good at determining whether roots are theirs or not - including other and their own species. Thus, trees connect with each other on purpose. 

But what does it mean for climate change? 

Climate change is caused by greenhouse gases and there are two primary ways to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere: either to reduce emissions or to sequester carbon. Most climate change solutions focus on reducing emissions. However, carbon sequestration can be a great option, too. Mutualism is important for storing carbon in the soil as it requires cooperation between microbial networks and plants. As was already noted, cooperation also makes sure more trees survive which contributes greatly to the amount of carbon sequestered. 

Besides the ability of trees to store carbon, it has many implications for other areas. For example, agriculture. As Janine Benyus points out, “Plowing and herbicides such as glyphosate disturb the network and phosphorus fertilizers tell bacterial and fungal helpers that they are not needed - not needed for water transport or pest defense, not needed to absorb the micronutrients our bodies long for.” It means that we artificially disconnect plants in agriculture from one another and they not only lose their ability to store carbon but also to provide us with nutrients we require. If only we realize how significant these networks are and of what great help they can be to reverse the climate change, we would think twice before interrupting the “vital conversation.” 

But most of all, “Wood Wide Web” can be an ingenious psychological metaphor. We tend not only to view plants as consumers and competitors but primarily ourselves. We are used to believing that the world is a scarce place and we need for fight for our place under the sun. But the reciprocity among trees tells us a different story. Mutualism is a big part of nature which helps us to survive. Janine Benyus notices that, “By recognizing, at last, the ubiquity of sharing and chaperoning, by acknowledging the fact that communal traits are quite natural, we get to see ourselves anew. We can return to our role as nurturers, one of the many helpers in this planetary story of collaborative healing.” When will we finally realize that we, humans, are not the destructors by nature? We can be many things and nurturers is one of them.",2018-12-12T06:50:25+00:00,,,,,,,,,,
Climatechange,comment,agriculture,ebmd71r,LarysaFabok,,You have written a great article. Well done. Make it longer.,2018-12-12T09:07:33+00:00,,,,,,,,,,
Climatechange,comment,agriculture,ebmx9mu,nibblerhank,,"First off sorry for the long comment. I read this over morning coffee and got super excited. Lots of cool topics in here and you have a good structure going. A few suggestions for accuracy and some other things to consider, though. I should preface this with saying I'm a forest ecologist who studies drought ecophysiology of trees, with a background in disturbance and community ecology.

1) The Clements/Gleason comparison isn't exactly accurate. While you're right that Gleasonian ecology has dominated the field for the last century, its not as simple as saying ""clements = community, gleason = individual"". In fact its a little more complicated, and can almost be the opposite. Clements tried arguing that the ecological community itself (referred to by him as a ""climax"", not to be confused with climax community) was a basic ecological unit; that is, a community could only exist in a set form made up of set organisms that would always eventually occur in the exact same assemblage. Gleason, on the other hand, argued that communities are made up of individuals, and that the basic ecology of each individual determined the final community composition. Gleasonian ecology is much more ""accurate"" in terms of how we know communities are structured, mostly because while facilitation does occur, facilitation itself doesn't always occur in the exact same manner. If Clementsian ecology were realistic, we would likely only see that same blue oak/grass community every single place where there is blue oak or that grass. Obvoiusly this is not true, but instead, the individual natural histories of the grass and the oak have led, over evolutionary time, to those species being distributed where they are, and they simply happen to overlap with each other. All that said...I do think incorporating clementsian ideas of communities as bounded entities in their own right is starting to gain traction again, and has some merit. I just think you should be careful about equating facilitation with the clementsian climax.

2) The idea that trees do something with ""purpose"" is also contentious. This is especially true with ""keeping other trees alive"". We do know that trees are far more interconnected than we previously realized, primarily through mycorhizzal networks which allow trees to share resources such a carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, and even water. But whether they are ""keeping the tree alive"" for some altruistic purpose or for some more innocuous reason is a little tougher. Trees move water through their stem via a combination of negative water potential (water being ""pulled"" through the stem) applied by dry air blowing over leaves, and also through passive capillary action. This second action is still a significant force as trees die. If I am a tree, and my roots are interconnected with that dead tree by a mycorhizal network (another important point here...the roots themselves are not directly connected, they are simply on the same fungal ""internet"" you describe), that tree then all of the sudden becomes a reservoir for resources...almost like a storage unit. It can still hold water in its wood that I can then draw from later, because that tree will no longer be using that water. I think the temptation to use humanized language to describe these tree networks is there, and makes sense, but I think we have to be careful. Suzanne Simard's chapter (and in fact the whole book) on how these networks mimic neural networks and even facilitate a kind of ""learning"" is a prime example (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-75596-0_10): the analogies between learning and memory make sense, but again the difference is ""active"" vs ""passive"". I should note to take all of this with a grain of salt, as I am actually currently revising a paper talking about 'decision making' in drought-stressed trees. But here again I use decision making to simplify the idea of evolutionarily selected strategies that confer the highest fitness in situation where multiple strategies are being used. 

3) Connecting points 1 and 2 relative to climate change: I think your article is already going in this direction - and I agree with a commenter below about how it can be longer - I think it would be cool if this article explored the implications of climate change for ecological networks/communities a little more. How do we think climate change will select for certain kinds of communities over others? If climate change acts as a selective force, can we in fact expect a shift from more individual-based communities to ""communities as units""? If some trees are more interconnected than others, are these trees more likely to be selected for by climate change, i.e. can we test some sort of expectation that a higher ""wood wide web bandwidth"" would lead to higher survival under climate stress?

Cool stuff, and lots of ideas to explore here. I'd be curious to see how it progresses! ",2018-12-12T15:58:18+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Climatechange,post,agriculture,bdmcbr,elcric_krej,Am I wrong in seeing potential beneficial consequences in regards to engineering coming from climate change ?,"Since I've been mathematically-informed enough to understand how meteorological models work ( on a high level, at least) and read the interpretations of the data that point towards increasing CO2 in the oceans/atmosphere, increasing temperatures and decreasing CO2 removal from said mediums... I've believed climate change is overall a bad thing.

&#x200B;

Sure, some places might fare better, but overall the new weather will (and to some extent already is) be more chaotic and hard to deal with.

&#x200B;

However, generally speaking, humans have been fairly good at dealing with extreme weather events, and that was dozens of thousands of years ago. Arguably, most of our works of engineering boil down to protecting ourselves from the environment, and we have a huge library of know how doing that... which isn't being utilized to it's full potential right now. 

&#x200B;

That is to say, if your aim is fame and fortune (either in cash or in nr of citations), your best bet in the current economic climate is hardly going to be weather resistant crops, material science focused on wind/rain/snow/heat resistant fabrics, efficient agriculture, Terraforming, tunneling ... etc (i.e important in dealing with the consequences of climate change).

&#x200B;

So, assuming that emissions do cause huge irreversible damage to our climate in the next 20 years (as in, the kind that threatens to disrupt people's lives to the extent that they'd be willing to put their capital behind stopping it), those fields of engineering would surely flourish.

&#x200B;

And, in the long run, two of humanities most pressing problem at the moment are:

&#x200B;

* Building habitable environments on nearby celestial bodies other than earth
* Changing the weather patterns in sub-Sharan Africa in such a way as to make Agriculture (which requires predictive weather patterns) easy, thus hopefully ending most of the death and suffering in that part of the world.

Only issue being... neither of those are being pursued by many driven people at the moment, due to the aforementioned lacking of our economic climate. Nor would they be, if climate change ramped up, but the technologies required would advance pretty quickly.

So, would I be wrong in adopting a view that climate change might actually help press humanity into more actively investing into niches that will be useful to us in the next hundreds of years, rather than wasting away our brightest on menial problems (e.g. trading, ads, insurance... etc) ? 

The one element that I feel is missing around the discussion about consequence is the actual opportunity extreme climate change might bring for restructuring our global economy into something with somewhat more interesting aims. Not to mention, it would surely make some fairly smart put complacent people jump into action to help, since many people are somewhat lethargic unless they are dealing with a real threat.

The best equivalent I can give for this, is how large wars usually manage to actually give us dozens of years of technological progress compressed in 5-7 years of join collaborative applied research.

I'm less confident about these claims of yours. Although if you have some specific examples, that would help people evaluate them.

The part about those fields of engineering being poised to grow (not necessarily flourish), though, is a good one.

Trying to identify pressing problems probably doesn't advance the conversation very much — but I think wider discussion of *feasible* solutions can. I usually make a short list of climate-change problems and then their corresponding solutions. For instance:

* **Sea-level rise**: Can be addressed by making investments in coastal defense, or else redirecting future growth further inland.

* **Ocean acidification**: Can be addressed by diversifying an economy's food sources.

* **Intensified storms**: Can be addressed by warning systems, evacuation infrastructures, and construction codes.

* **Water shortages**: Can be addressed in several ways, including conservation, pumping, and utilizing technologies like purification and desalination. 

* **Very high surface/air temperatures**: Can be addressed by local climate control efforts — which can include steps as simple (and comparatively low-tech) as planting shade trees or painting roofs white.

* **Ecosystem collapse**: Is a tough and potentially worrisome one — ecosystem monitoring and management are known disciplines, although they have a long ways to go in order to be effective against imminent collapses.

I think a lot of older people feel stressed about climate issues because they imagine trying to address the climate challenges of 2040 or 2060 with 20th-century technology. But that just isn't plausible: When there's a demand for advances in adaptation technologies, then advances will be made. 

The extent of those advances remains to be seen and can't be predicted — and implementing such advances will depend on other tricky variables like levels of investment and political coordination. But solving environmental problems has been a constant theme of civilization since the dawn of human history. There's no reason to think that effort has stalled in the current era. In fact it's probably accelerating.

I try to speak up for the Adaptationist view when I can. There are often lots of historical data to point to in support of some adaptation conjecture or another.",2019-04-16T02:38:40+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Ah, fair enough, so this standpoint does exist. Glad to know there is a name for it, will make it much easier to explain and or search about in my future procrastinations.

&#x200B;

Other than that, I pretty much agree with your post. 

\> I'm less confident about these claims of yours. Although if you have some specific examples, that would help people evaluate them.

The list of example I gave was pretty much of the top of my head. The way I would back them up varies:

&#x200B;

* Weather resistant crops (easy to make, there's nothing to say succulents and pines can't grow fast or sprout delicious fruits, and with the advent of cas9 and cas3 it's literally any issue of getting enough labs working on it and then experimenting with the resulting seeds)

Deep, still water encourages the growth of algae, which consume nitrogen before it becomes a gas. Eventually, the algae die and fall to the bottom of the pond, never allowing the nitrogen to escape into the atmosphere.

I still doubt that freshwater algae will offer the necessary scale to influence the global atmosphere — but that's interesting.

>The researchers aren’t focused only on N2O in farm ponds. High soil pH levels in the study area mean that carbon dioxide in the ponds is converted to other forms of dissolved carbon, meaning the ponds act as carbon sinks as well as nitrogen sinks. Like pond depth and wind shelter, the pH level of ponds can be controlled. 

Also interesting.

Interesting possible direction for agricultural policy to go. It turns out these ponds could be the key to turning farms into carbon offsets. An idea which probably doesn't scale globally, but which might be important on the scale of a regional economy.

---

So let's debunk this methane silliness. Here are the salient points:

- Methane represents about 15% of the change in radiative forcing from GHGs over the last century.^1

- Atmospheric methane increased more rapidly during the 20th century than it has this century, both in absolute terms and in terms of percent of total methane.^2

- Methane has a halflife of about 8.6 years. That means that of a given quantity of methane released into the atmosphere today, half will remain in 8.6 years, a quarter in 17.2 years, an eighth in 25.8 years, etc.^3 

- More methane is released from cows, natural wetlands, rice paddies, or biomass burning than is released from the permafrost.^4

- More methane is released from leaks in gas lines than is released from the permafrost.^4 

- The forcing from methane follows the square root of concentration.^5

Putting all of this together, then, says that the future change in radiative forcing due to methane will be marginal. Even if more methane is released from permafrost than is currently observed, that can be offset by changing how we grow rice or better monitoring of gas lines or even changing what we feed cows.

If you want something that's realistic (which is the only kind of sci-fi I will read; I don't like sci-fantasy because it invokes magic as a lazy solution to the author's lack of imagination), there are a few things people could do to increase temperatures.

- A rogue group could spray black carbon across marginal ice regions. Think something fine, like black toner. This would cause the reflective ice to melt, causing more warming.

- A group could focus on producing a really nasty GHG like sulfur hexaflouride (SF6). It has **23,500 times** the 100 year GHG equivalent of CO2. It's also less than 10 parts per trillion in the atmosphere right now, which means that adding it bunch to the atmosphere would result in a forcing directly proportional to concentration. (At higher concentrations, GHGs follow functions of diminishing returns.) Not only that, SF6 has a really long atmospheric residency. It's a nightmare GHG.

Yes, and as counterintuitive as it sounds, that's one of two reasons methane is not as scary as most people believe. 

GHGs follow functions of diminishing return as they become more plentiful in the atmosphere. It's logarithmic in the case of CO2 and a function of the square root of concentration in the case of methane.

I'd like to know where they get the 1 trillion metric tons goal from though? 

the IPCC SR1.5 has this to say about soil sequestration:

>At local scales there is robust evidence that Soil Carbon Sequestration (SCS, e.g.,agroforestry,De Stefano and Jacobson,2018), restoration of degraded land (Griscom et al., 2017), or conservation agriculture management practices (Aguilera et al., 2013; Poeplau and Don, 2015; Vicente-Vicente et al., 2016)have co-benefits in agriculture and that many measures are cost-effective even without supportive climate policy. 

Ok, good stuff, seem to be in line so far, now lets look at numbers.

>Evidence at global scale for potentials and especially costs is much lower.

...

>The literature spans cost ranges of –40–100 USDtCO2-1(negative costs relating to the multiple co-benefits of SCS, such as increased productivity and resilience of soils (P. Smith et al., 2014)and 2050 potentials are estimated between 1–11 GtCO2 yr-1, narrowed down to **2–5 GtCO2yr-1** considering that studies above 5 GtCO2 yr-1 often do not apply constraints, while estimates lower than 2 GtCO2yr-1 mostly focus on single practices (Fuss et al., 2018).

Ok, so sequestration possibility of 2-5GtCO2yr. No bad - but wouldn't that take 200-500 years to sequester 1Tt?

>SCS has negligible water and energy requirements (Smith, 2016), affects nutrients and food security favourably (high agreement, robust evidence)and can be applied without changing current land use thus making it socially more acceptable than CDR options with a high land footprint. **However, soil sinks saturate after 10–100 years, depending on the SCS option, soil type and climate zone (Smith, 2016)**.

Ouch, so ""best case"" would be ~500Gt over 100 years if all soil could sequester the maximum possible (not at all probable). Taking a mid range of  3.5Gt/yr and saturation period of 50 years gives us only.... 175GtCO2 sequestered. 

In addition, we need to consider the large amounts of fossil fuels used in agriculture - I don't have a number on this at hand, but the emissions related to fertilizer production (Haber-Bosch, phosphorous rock mining), transportation, running (and producing) the farm equipment, etc.

The stated benefits are quite close to my understanding of biochar, so most likely it's a form of biochar or similar.

Edit: And the natural progression would be ""How much would biochar add to soil sequestration"". The answer is... not much:

>Fuss et al. (2018)lower the 2050 range to **0.3–2 GtCO2 yr-1**. This potential is below previous estimates (e.g.,Woolf et al.,2010), which additionally consider the displacement of fossil fuels through biochar. Permanence depends on soil type and biochar production temperatures, varying between a few decades and several centuries (Fang et al., 2014). Costs are 30–120 USD tCO2–1(medium agreement, medium evidence) (McCarl et al., 2009; McGlashan et al., 2012; McLaren, 2012; Smith, 2016).

>However, 40–260 Mha are needed to grow the biomass for biochar for implementation at 0.3 GtCO2-eq yr–1(Smith, 2016), even though it is also possible to use residues (e.g., Windeatt et al.,2014). Biochar is further constrained by the maximum safe holding capacity of soils (Lenton, 2010)and the labile nature of carbon sequestrated in plants and soil at higher temperatures (Wang et al., 2013).

So, over our previously considered 50 yer estimate, Biochar could add a middle estimate of 1.1GtCO2/yr for a total of 55GtCo2 at a land-cost of ~5Bha of land devoted *only* to biochar creation. 

To put that in context, the USA only has ~ [174.5Mha](https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Agriculture/Arable-land/Hectares) of arable land. According to [""Our World in Data""](https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture) to total global agricultural land area is 4,889 million ha or 4.8Bha and total global land area is ~13Bha . This would mean that, based on the IPCC numbers, it would take 38% of our total global land area (and more than our total current agricultural land area) to produce biomass for biochar - to sequester *only* 1.1GtCO2/yr. This, when one of the primary suggestions by the IPCC is to *decrease* total land-under-agriculture by 25%+ by 2050 in order to facilitate aforestation and reforestation (which are estimated to capture and sequester more CO2/yr than biochar anyways). This does not seem like either a realistic option (logistics alone), not an optimal option for carbon capture and sequestration.  Most likely, biochar will only function to increase agricultural output and assist in creating long-term, sustainable, healthy soil - but will play little to no roll in carbon capture and sequestration.",2019-06-23T18:36:39+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Nice, thanks for this – only point I'd make is biochar creation doesn't necessarily need land - it just needs a facility to essentially 'char' whatever material you want to use.

&#x200B;

There's just lots of interesting applications of it – one other I liked is that it speeds up growth for plants/tree's ... so i.e. if you planted tree's and they need 10 years to get to maturity so that they could be capturing the fully estimated amount of c02, adding biochar into the soil would speed up that process by double.",2019-06-23T21:00:08+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/where_do_trees_get_their_mass_from

The mass of a tree is primarily carbon. The carbon comes from carbon dioxide used during photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants convert the sun’s energy into chemical energy which is captured within the bonds of carbon molecules built from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water. Yes, the carbon from carbon dioxide in the air we breathe out ends up in “food” molecules (called glucose) each of which contains 6 carbon atoms (and 12 hydrogen atoms and 6 oxygen atoms).

I think the benefit of adding forms of carbon to the soil is that it improves aeration and water retention. This provides a better environment for soil organisms. ie. symbolic bacteria that can covert  atmospheric NO2 directly from air in the soil to NO3 that is taken up from the soil by the plant through the roots.

Climatechange,post,agriculture,c7razk,IightYAGAMl,Couldn’t find a flaw in this conspiracy about an alternative cause of global warming,"Humans consume 10 million gigatons of water each year. 70% of that is used to water  plants in agriculture (1). The water on the fields has 3 ways to go:
 - sinking deep into lower levels of the soil 
 - evaporate 
 - being absorbed by the plants (what also eventually leads to evaporation, because plants evaporate water over the leaves)

Actually farmers try to increase field water efficiency (fraction of water used by plants to total water used) but let’s say only 10% evaporate. That means 700 000 gigatons of water evaporate each year. Most of it by Irrigation. Rivers are redirected and spread over huge agricultural areas. On that area the sun developes enough energy to evaporate the water while it would just run into  the ocean without human influence. So we are basically evaporating rivers all over the world. And that is much more efficient than digging for coal and burn it.

But what about rain? Water doesn’t stay in the atmosphere!

Yes, and that’s why many reliable sources claim human couldn’t influence water content in the atmosphere. Because it comes down again, it can’t increase, can it? Yes of course it can. The numbers of airplanes in the air is increasing even though they don’t stuck in the air. Around 16000 planes are in the air right now (2019) and this number is going to increase. Around 200000 takeoffs  every day, which means around 8000 take offs per hour. An average flight duration of 2 hours means, that when you take off, 16 000 other planes take off before you land. And if you increase the take offs per hour you will have more planes in the air, even if the average duration remains at 2 hours.
So the same thing with water. Water remains about 10 days in the atmosphere (2). As mentioned earlier, 700 000 gigatons are evaporated each year. That means 2000 gigatons per day. So within the 10 day lifetime of water 20 000 gigatons are  evaporated due to human influences. Compared to CO2 we emit 30 gigatons each year. according to the simple calculation above we increased the water content much more than we increased CO2. And that while H2O is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. That would mean water vapor is the main cause of global warming!

Why can’t we measure the increase of water?

A gas needs around 1 year to reach each part of the atmosphere and even longer to be homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. Since the lifetime of CO2 is so large, it actually is almost homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. That means if you measure CO2 in only one spot, you know the content on alle other spots, because it’s the same.
H20 however has a short life time. The water content varies extremely in different location. When you see clouds, the water content is higher in the cloud than right next to it. You would need an infinite amount of measure spots to estimate the global water content in the atmosphere. Secondly the water content is around 2%. 2.43% or 2.44% is an increase by less than 1%. But for CO2 a difference between 0,03 and 0,04 is significant enough to be measured.

But we can’t add water to the atmosphere!

I never understood this argument. Ever hang out wet laundry? It dries in the sun. The water doesn’t disappear, it evaporates and is in the atmosphere. If the relative humidity (RH) was 100% the clothes wouldn’t dry. Sweating would be inefficient and you would have fog. At 100% RH you need to heat the air in order to take up more water. However when RH is below 100% it can take up more water. That’s the definition of RH. And as we observe in daily life, 100% RH is not common on surface altitude. That’s how sweating works, water is evaporating from the skin to cool the skin. And that’s possible without heating up the air, otherwise evolution wouldn’t have given us the ability to sweat.

Possible mistakes/errors

* most trivial would be a failed conversion between gigatons, cubic meter, kg etc.. because we are talking about millions of gigatons it’s possible. I think I did it right but maybe double check.
* error in the basic concept: maybe I overlooked something. Most likely the point why humans can’t add water to atmosphere. Many sources claim we have to heat up the air to increase water content. But I don’t understand why. I think it would be true at 100%RH but below we can ofcourse evaporate water as we observe in daily life. In Chile millions of liter of water are pumped to the surface and evaporated by the sun because in the remaining salt Lithium can be found. I think I gave enough example why I think we actually can evaporate water. The claim we can’t sounds so stupid to me, I don’t know why everyone says that.
* some more complex phenomenon is involved. Maybe water evaporated from agriculture has a different life time. A few hours would be enough though. The amount of water evaporation is so much higher than the CO2... Also i don’t see why water vapor from humans would behave different than natural vapor. We are basically just wetting the earths surface. Then the sun does the rest in natural processes.

I think it’s more likely I did a mistake and that most of other scientists are right. However I didn’t find a flaw here. Most people I explained this to blamed me as a sceptic but didn’t have any scientific argument. I’m open to discussion but I hope you are open too and can consider my thoughts scientifically and neutrally even though it’s against the consensus.
Thank you.

So why do you propose water used by humans for agriculture is so much more likely to evaporate than water not used for agriculture? The same amount of water still exists if it isn't used by humans.

\----------------------------------------------

Edit:[Here's a science reporting article](https://physicsworld.com/a/are-our-water-vapour-emissions-warming-the-climate/) written about this subject with links to scientific studies. The main study finds an upper bound forcing due to water vapor emissions from irrigation is 0.05W/m2 (though the uncertainty range doesn't rule out a very small negative forcing). That compares with about 2W/m2 for CO2.

The thing people often don't understand about the greenhouse effect is that **where** the gases are in the atmosphere is just as important as how much. In the case of surface water vapor emissions, they typically don't rise very high in the atmosphere before dropping out again, so the amount of water vapor at any given moment may be elevated but it's almost all at low altitudes. It's gases at high altitudes which really make the difference. CO2 has a strong effect because the concentration is well mixed even up into the stratosphere, whereas water vapor concentrations decline strongly beyond the first few kilometres. As it says in the article, even though the amounts of water vapor involved are likely to be much less, water vapor emissions from air travel may have a larger effect than irrigation due to the high altitude.",2019-07-01T12:32:30+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

It does not.  If ""multiple lines of evidence point to this conclusion"" then rather than saying that, make the 3 strongest cases.  Imagine trying a murder case and using ""we have multiple lines of evidence to tie this defendant to the crime"" without listing the evidence.  Eveyone can point a link at a magazine article listing correlations.  None of them are definitive evidence, though.  It's getting warmer, CO2 is a GHG, we've increased the level of CO2, therefore warming is all our fault!

Let me try this one on for size: we have solid confirmation that it was colder when pirates roamed the seas and raided merchant sailing ships.  The number of Pirates has been reduced, the world has warmed.  Law enforcement via military ships hunting down the pirates has reduced the number of pirates, therefore warming is due to military conquest of pirates via hunting them down in their sailing ships and hanging them.  

If we want to see a return to cold days, crop failures due to early frost, people freezing in their homes, all we have to do is to get rid of ocean going military-based law enforcement.

Your second point is covered in OP. I copy paste it for you:
Why can’t we measure the increase of water?
A gas needs around 1 year to reach each part of the atmosphere and even longer to be homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. Since the lifetime of CO2 is so large, it actually is almost homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. That means if you measure CO2 in only one spot, you know the content on alle other spots, because it’s the same. H20 however has a short life time. The water content varies extremely in different location. When you see clouds, the water content is higher in the cloud than right next to it. You would need an infinite amount of measure spots to estimate the global water content in the atmosphere. Secondly the water content is around 2%. 2.43% or 2.44% is an increase by less than 1%. But for CO2 a difference between 0,03 and 0,04 is significant enough to be measured.",2019-07-01T13:06:31+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

I never understood this argument. Ever hang out wet laundry? It dries in the sun. The water doesn’t disappear, it evaporates and is in the atmosphere. If the relative humidity (RH) was 100% the clothes wouldn’t dry. Sweating would be inefficient and you would have fog (edit: or a cloud in higher altitudes as the Forbes professor correctly said). At 100% RH you need to heat the air in order to take up more water. However when RH is below 100% it can take up more water. That’s the definition of RH. And as we observe in daily life, 100% RH is not common on surface altitude. That’s how sweating works, water is evaporating from the skin to cool the skin. And that’s possible without heating up the air, otherwise evolution wouldn’t have given us the ability to sweat.”

**Going Halfway: Climate Reports Ignore the Full Evidence, and Therapists Ignore Grief Recovery**, by Guy R. McPherson

**Abstract**: This paper draws a parallel between climate-science reporting and “grief” work. The corporate media, governments, and paid climate scientists report only a portion of the evidence with respect to climate change. Similarly, many practitioners of the grief trade fail to propose grief recovery on behalf of their clients. In both cases, the transfer of fiat currency from the ill-informed to the better-informed serves as potential motivation.

In 2016, he claimed that most of the life on Earth would go extinct. In 2017, he claimed the humanity would go extinct by mid-2018 after temperatures increase by 6 degrees. In June of last year, he claimed that industrial civilization would collapse by September of 2018.

With managed bamboo farms we could outperform pine tree forests with taking Carbon out of the atmosphere. 

We can also make biochar (high temp burn under low oxygen conditions) which produces bio-oil and syngas. Those are renewable energy sources.

""If you could continually turn a lot of organic matter into biochar, you could, over time, reverse the history of the last two-hundred years.""-- Bill McKibben

""Carbon sequestration in soil also has significant potential. Biochar, produced in pyrolysis of residues from crops, forestry, and animal wastes, can be used to restore soil fertility while storing carbon for centuries to millennia. Biochar helps soil retain nutrients and fertilizers, reducing emissions of GHGs such as N2O. Replacing slash-and-burn agriculture with slash-and-char and use of agricultural and forestry wastes for biochar production could provide a CO2 drawdown of \~8 ppm or more in half a century.""-- Dr. James Hansen (NASA climate scientist).

Also, Biochar can filter water and make it drinkable. Yay!

I'm trying to reach an investor to buy some land and start planting Bamboo. My goal is 3 months. We need to move quickly if this is going to work. However, there are some ideas I have to reduce our Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Ideas that I want to make sure are in the right hands...

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,f0izzgz,crashorbit,,"[Drawdown.org](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions) lists afforestation as number 15.  

The carbon budget for this process will need to include the energy cost of generating biochar.  It'll be hard to ramp up to scales where industrial efforts at carbon sequestration are sufficient to balance current industrial output without impacting land needed for food production.  We see that effect with ethanol production in the US today.  

Engineered bamboo products is an interesting alternative to engineered pine products. It can probably be made more carbon neutral too. Especially if we can avoid the use of petroleum products as glues and cleaners.

The best afforestation approaches are to re-establish and extend self sustaining environments of all types including bamboo forests. Let carbon sequestration occur as part of the natural composting process. 

If we need to sequester carbon from the atmosphere at large enough rates to be significant then  the only viable large scale method is ocean fertilization.",2019-09-16T15:54:43+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Seems like a cool initiative! 

I'd like to know where they get the 1 trillion metric tons goal from though? 

the IPCC SR1.5 has this to say about soil sequestration:

>At local scales there is robust evidence that Soil Carbon Sequestration (SCS, e.g.,agroforestry,De Stefano and Jacobson,2018), restoration of degraded land (Griscom et al., 2017), or conservation agriculture management practices (Aguilera et al., 2013; Poeplau and Don, 2015; Vicente-Vicente et al., 2016)have co-benefits in agriculture and that many measures are cost-effective even without supportive climate policy. 

Ok, good stuff, seem to be in line so far, now lets look at numbers.

>Evidence at global scale for potentials and especially costs is much lower.

...

>The literature spans cost ranges of –40–100 USDtCO2-1(negative costs relating to the multiple co-benefits of SCS, such as increased productivity and resilience of soils (P. Smith et al., 2014)and 2050 potentials are estimated between 1–11 GtCO2 yr-1, narrowed down to **2–5 GtCO2yr-1** considering that studies above 5 GtCO2 yr-1 often do not apply constraints, while estimates lower than 2 GtCO2yr-1 mostly focus on single practices (Fuss et al., 2018).

Ok, so sequestration possibility of 2-5GtCO2yr. No bad - but wouldn't that take 200-500 years to sequester 1Tt?

>SCS has negligible water and energy requirements (Smith, 2016), affects nutrients and food security favourably (high agreement, robust evidence)and can be applied without changing current land use thus making it socially more acceptable than CDR options with a high land footprint. **However, soil sinks saturate after 10–100 years, depending on the SCS option, soil type and climate zone (Smith, 2016)**.

Ouch, so ""best case"" would be ~500Gt over 100 years if all soil could sequester the maximum possible (not at all probable). Taking a mid range of  3.5Gt/yr and saturation period of 50 years gives us only.... 175GtCO2 sequestered. 

In addition, we need to consider the large amounts of fossil fuels used in agriculture - I don't have a number on this at hand, but the emissions related to fertilizer production (Haber-Bosch, phosphorous rock mining), transportation, running (and producing) the farm equipment, etc.

Hurricanes will be stronger and cities in Asia, Australia and the south-east of the US will face destruction. Holland will be torn apart by the North Sea.

Saltwater will creep upstream, poisoning the groundwater and ruining the food supply.

4 ℃ - 
millions of people will begin to flee coastal areas, cities will begin to vanish and some will become islands.

The ice at both poles will vanish over time and this could see a rise in sea levels of as much as 50m, although this may take hundreds or thousands of years.

China, a major producer of the world's rice, wheat and maize, could see its agriculture fail - it will need to feed more than a billion people on two-thirds of its current harvest.

Summers will be longer and soaring temperatures will see forests turn to firewood, with even Britain's south reaching 45 ℃. The increased demand on air-conditioning puts massive pressure on the country's power grid.

5 ℃ higher in the oceans - 
frozen methane hydrate from the seabeds will gasify and ascend to the atmosphere. 
Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and may cause an extra temperature rise of 4-5 ℃ over time. 

6 ℃ - 
rainforests will be deserts and massive numbers of migrants will flock to the few parts of the world they see as inhabitable, resulting in racial conflict and civil war.

Many will choose places such as Canada and Siberia but even those climates may be too hot to grow food.

Stagnant oceans mean more hydrogen sulphide, which kills the sea-life and, if the sea heats up enough, massive stores of methane hydrate under the sea will begin to escape.

Methane is flammable and the smallest spark or lightning strike could see fireballs tearing across the sky. 

10 ℃ - is generally accepted as a figure able to cause truly global mass extinction.

A poorly edited documentary about the woes of the green revolution was released for free on Youtube yesterday. You might consider its makers the left of the left, a fringe hating the movement generally loved by the left. Can’t anyone who loves the planet get behind green energy? It appears not. I dislike this documentary about as much as I loved it. It highlights some of what I have been thinking for about three years now. What it did not do was offer solutions, which I will do for you and for the makers of this film. If you were to watch this piece and do nothing further you might feel that we are now completely hopeless. The tech we hoped to save us can’t. Wind turbines, solar panels even hydro all have environmental implications. The truth is, the green energy you might be thinking is going to be ubiquitous will just be a small bit player in a truly verdant future.

I’m going to outline for you problems and, in my view, a few viable solutions. First let’s discuss the film itself. The film is bleak starting with an Earth day celebration narrated by a bore in Gibbs. He found diesel backup at an Earth day celebration. Guess what? Who cares. Small beans. The film then goes on to complain about car manufacturers making electric cars, using the Chevy Volt as a prop because the electricity that fuels them in Lansing Michigan is from coal. My question for the film maker is this: Does he expect everything to change all at once in every city in the world? He probably does, but that isn't possible. I think its OK to build a carrot to force the stick be built. It how things are going to happen, if they happen at all. He should be spending his time talking about what it would take for the nation to electrify vehicular travel, with low or no emissions. It still requires the electric car! Damn him for pooing on real progress that was the Volt. If there is a tragedy in the film it’s that Americans didn’t embrace the Volt in the first place!

I’m going to skip to the ending for a minute. Gibbs tell us at the end of the film what we have to do. Its answer: Use less. What an over simplified, ridiculous and vague cop out of an answer. It IS true that we need to use less, but what does he mean by this? How much less? What’s most important to use less of? How should we power the planet for what we still make in an era of less? Should we just turn off the lights and cars and hospitals and businesses and food production and call it a good run for humanity but it’s time to die now? No answers or hints of answers in this film. This is a problematic ending. It decries use of typical energy sources, then does the same to green energy then offers nothing in its place. The film is not *wrong* but it brings us to place of hopelessness where all things are equally bad.

Things are not equally bad. Solar and wind turbines have merit, and it is more than that of coal. Wind turbines for example pay back their manufacturing cost (in terms of greenness not money) in three years. They last for 20. It’s 17 years of useful green energy. It is however intermittent, and when it isnt provide power natural gas is its backup. Windmill farms do, as the documentary spends a lot of time pointing out, often hurt the environment they are put in by having forests cleard for them or killing apex birds. But again, this film fails to offer an answer. Gibbs could have suggested a changes to the EPA that rates environmental degradation prior to placing wind or solar on the land. It is yet again political will that we need here to provide a holistic framework to place renewables. **We should concurrently be working on truly recyclable plastics for everything, including windmills and solar panels.** We should be working more on long term storage batteries including iron flow, and testing out massive gravity storage application to balance out wind and solar. We should be working on replacements for chemicals used in turbines that are extremely environmentally unfriendly like Sulphur hexafluoride, or SF6, which has a CO2 equivalent of 117 tonnes of carbon ([That is not a misprint](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-49567197)) per windmill if emitted. Still these technologies are better than a coal plants which release about two billion tons of CO2 per year. **Remember energy isn't free and steps into the future will involve compromise.**

Next, the problems of accountability shown in the film.

‘Green’ energy is nuanced and we don’t have a standardized system of accounting for what is and isn’t worthwhile. What this documentary revealed was just how far corporate tentacles have reached into the organisations we think untouchable. Examples provided are the Sierra Club, Al Gore and Tesla. However these people and organisations who have put environmentalism on the dinner table menu never get a chance to defend themselves. This film is part hit piece and the director isn’t happy with anyone, including himself.

What Gibbs seems to find most frustrating apart from humanity’s existence is biomass energy. Biomass is difficult to define because it can mean many things. The US energy administration defines biomass as energy derived from burnt wood chips, agriculture waste, food garbage or manure including sewage. This invites an important distinction under the green umbrella. There is renewable and there is low carbon. Burning wood for energy is nice by a campfire but one of the worst ways possible to power an industrialized nation. High resource use, high carbon emission, low energy density, particulate emissions, but yes renewable.

Moving onto solutions Because this movie doesn’t have any. (Warning US centric)

Solution 1) Electrifying everything, especially cars. I am a believer in the series hybrids such as the Volt and this is why I was so upset to see it used as a foil. You can use a lot less cobalt in a battery that is ⅙ the size of a typical Tesla. The Volt had a 50 mile battery and when depleted and gas generator kicked on to power the battery. Most people drive less that 30 miles per day, and would decrease gas use by 70–80% for most people. This is like getting a gasoline car that got 115+ miles per gallon. The Volt could have been the perfect transition vehicle into a more electrified nation. We build chargers everywhere and learn to build better batteries with less rare metals which are toxic, and mined under horrific conditions.

Solution 2) Have a commission that provides both a general rating and a specific rating to a given technology and what can be done to improve it. These ratings should be simple enough for the public to understand them. For example a rating of 1 is the ideal green energy and coal is a 10 where does X technology fall? And on the site that is being proposed, does it change this number. Is this old, slow growth forest move a 3 technology to a 6? Keep the rating measure simple even if what going into the rating is complex. This would help keep things like biomass from seeming friendly when it isn’t.

Solution 3) Solar, wind and hydro where it makes sense while we continue to work on underlying tech that would alleviate the need for natural gas as backup. I feel that solar and wind belongs in rural places that are too small to economically connect to larger electrical grids. So what do I think should power most other things, see solution 4.

Solution 4) Nuclear. The film touches on nuclear for such a short time (about 10 seconds) that you get the feeling that the word nuclear alone is supposed to be enough to scare off any one willing to watch such a film as ‘Planet of the Humans’. What I am calling for is Gen 4 walk away safe Nuclear. Such as what Bill gates has spent a billion of his own dollars [developing.](https://www.terrapower.com/) In addition developing small modular nuclear reactors in the realm of 200–300MWe per unit. Why?

Nuclear is the greenest power source, even compared to wind and solar, [LINK](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nuclear-less-co2-than-solar-hydro-biomass/). It is the least deadly power source [LINK](https://www.statista.com/statistics/494425/death-rate-worldwide-by-energy-source/). It is dispatchable (non variable), meaning it doesn’t require an entire extra natural gas backup plant to exist when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing. Did you know that natural gas companies LOVE wind, are backing and promoting solar and wind energy? For every solar setup we build we are committing ourselves to 20–30 years of a wind/NG combination. It is much better than a coal plant, but much worse than a nuclear plant.

Further, we don’t have to overbuild nuclear energy. To have wind and solar power the US without NG we would have to massively over build capacity (not within any economic reason) [LINK](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/radical-idea-get-high-renewable-electric-grid-build-way-more-solar-and-wind-needed). Nuclear is nearly plug and play and doesn’t require the massive infrastructure overhaul that 100% solar and wind would require.

Downsides of nuclear before the commentators get to it, and no neither the pro or con list is exhaustive.

Cost: Nuclear is very expensive up front. There are plenty of ways to mitigate this but in the end there will always be truth to it. When energy experts consider any form of energy they use LCOE (levelized cost of energy). Nuclear is very competitive in terms of $/kwh, but it requires large upfront investment. What we need is the *ideal* large and small reactors developed with the help of multiple governments and companies. One design for a large plant and one design for a small plant. Then those governments that developed can build it out for free. Ideal designs would be walk away safe design (no meltdown possible), molten salt reactors (efficient, non pressurized reactors), using uranium waste as fuel. That’s right, these plants can eat spent nuclear waste (an over simplification read more about that and more [here](https://www.wired.com/story/next-gen-nuclear/)). Side note: Forget thorium (which has a huge fanboy club), it’s not needed and ultimately has similar problems to uranium. You can still make weapons from it, you can make salt reactors with uranium, and yes I want to use waste uranium — not dig up new thorium.

Nuclear proliferation: Simply put, the biggest contributors to global warming already have nuclear weapons. If in the future these plants made it to countries without nuclear weapons I believe they should be heavily defended but that’s a concern for the distant problem that I wish we had now.

Nuclear waste: The plants I’m espousing use nuclear waste to fuel themselves. Also, consider this. All nuclear waste in the USA right now could fit into one super Walmart. Bam! It is so much more manageable than detractors want you to think and comes down to the one thing I’ve kept mentioning in this article: Political willpower.

One day nuclear power won’t be the best option. We may finally develop a perfect batteries for short, medium and long term energy storage solutions. Fusion might finally work. Maybe clean coal becomes more than a figment of republicans’ imagination (ha!). But for now it is by far the best option we have. We can begin building out our best iterations and keep developing the ideal solution which could be ready for massive implementation in 10 years such as a Terrapower module. It has already been 10 years since the Great recession, what the hell have we been waiting for, a pandemic?

For us to tackle global warming, in time or at all, it is going to take brutal pragmatism. That is why I believe this film, Planet of the Humans, is helpful. While it is unnecessarily hopeless it does convey that not all things are what we think they are. Green isn’t always green, it’s complicated. Right now while trillions of dollars are being spent to support the world during a pandemic is the perfect time to pivot to a long overdue clean future. It might be the only time until another catastrophic event arrives, approximately 10 years from now, making it 40 years later than we should have acted in the first place to save the Earth.",2020-04-22T22:02:49+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

It's time to be pragmatic. Our economy requires energy for production, transportation, heating... First step : sobriety (produce, transport, heat less... only when needed). Second step : energy efficiency (if you need to produce, try to use less energy for the same result). 
Third step : use low carbon energy sources, all of them. 
That's of course not compatible wih GDP growth but I guess we should reconsider priorities...

Right now we're acting mostly on step3, which is not the priority, and we're doing it poorly. Most of environmental activists and the general population are betting on technological revolutions. They won't be there in time. We're already 40 years late. No time to wait for batteries or ""power to gas"" to support the windmills we're installing everywhere, if they ever are available without too much downsides. One of the main reason there's so much support for intermittent renewables is that they need to be backed up and that's mostly by gas. Of course oil and gas majors are pushing for more renewables (ads, lobbying, financing some environmental movements like Greenpeace or Sierra club). They did not wake up being climate activists, that's good for their business... Is that climate-friendly to burn gas ? Only in places that mostly rely on coal... 

We should exit coal as fast as possible. 

Not nuclear which is a very precious ally in the fight - while still not being a silver bullet. Most of IPCC's ""intense mitigation"" scenarii and IEA's recommandations suggest increasing nuclear power. Too sad,  we're closing nuclear plants in many places, thanks to ideology, manipulation (lots of flat out lies about dangers, waste...) and antiscience activism. And we're closing them before coal... That's sad.

On the one hand you deny that man has any influence over the climate, but then you go and quote papers that have that as their conclusion or at minimum, in the underlying assumptions. The cognitive dissonance required for that is breathtaking.

Of course it could be that you have no idea what you're talking about or what it is you're posting.

I assume from this mishmash of ideas that you're trying to convince people that coral bleaching isn't a problem? If that's the case, you're going to have a hard time because your very first link - unrelated to bleaching I might note - contains this gem:

>Occurrences of three common diseases affecting Caribbean corals spike during El Niño years, an alarming association given how climate change may boost the intensity of El Niños.

And

>And because of the potential increase in the intensity of El Niño weather patterns associated with climate change, ""our findings suggest that we might see diseases in corals ramping up in the coming decades,"" Randall added.

Elsewhere in your linked research paper about El Nino, sea surface temperature anomaly and bleaching

>These anomalies are related to global climate changes, and global warming in particular. Mass bleaching events have become more frequent over the last 40 years.

Or your piece about coral bleaching dating back 400 years (from the Evening Express  no less) quotes one of the researchers for the paper

>However, the increase in bleaching frequency and the numbers of corals affected since temperatures started consistently increasing in the modern era raises serious concerns about whether corals are approaching a critical threshold beyond which their long-term survival is uncertain.

And others come to similar conclusions. Some gems include

>Coral-algal partnerships have endured numerous climate change events in their long history, and **at least some** are likely to survive modern-day global warming as well

Yay. Some. That's good, I guess.

>corals at or near the equator are **affected less** than corals elsewhere

Affected *less*. So, still affected, just not as bad? Ok.

>""Heating up many corals even mildly can negatively impact a variety of physiological processes. However, this study shows that small increases could provide greater protection by resident fishes. Obviously this can't go on for forever, though. At some point, all the protection in the world won't matter anything if the corals can't feed themselves

From the piece that showed a link between how recovery from bleaching is influenced by nearby fish.

The summary is that, as atmospheric carbon levels increased, grasses grew taller, but levels of key nutrients and minerals (N, P, K) decreased, in some cases by up to 50% over 20 years. This explained a significant amount of the variability in grasshopper decline, in addition to temperature and climate oscillation. The authors identified \~50 additional articles reporting significant declines in plant nutrient concentrations over time - in not only grasses, but woody plants, trees, legumes, and agricultural crops across the world. 

More than half of all insect species are herbivorous - including many moths, butterflies, beetles, weevils, and aphids. Based on what I remember from my college-level ecology classes, 90% of insect biomass is made up of herbivores. As our insect populations crash, how will that affect populations of wildlife that feed on them? Furthermore, based on the above trends, grass forage will have little to no nutritional value within 25-50 years. How will that affect other populations of herbivorous mammals and the species that prey on them?

TL/DR: Nutrient dilution receives very little media attention or discussion in the climate forums but could result in the extinction of a large number of herbivorous species (and others that depend on them) over the next 50 to 100 years.",2020-07-04T03:29:05+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

The predicted conditions experienced neither extreme drought nor extreme wet events; however, severe and moderately drought events remain a challenge up to 2060. Due to climate change and current water management practices, the FAO-Aquacrop predicted reductions in crop yields and water productivity, especially for cotton and sorghum of 40 and 29 % respectively. Optimized future crop scenarios indicate that food crops such as sorghum and wheat are not viable. Cash (cotton) and soil fertility maintenance crops (groundnuts) would be better for sustaining economic viability. The agricultural policy and water management practices thus should be revisited to keep pace with future climate changes.

So, climate change will ""destroy agriculture"" ... unless water management practices are revisited.

Doesn't seem to reflect reality.

A warmer climate has lead to more precipitation world wide.  The earth is far greener also as we warm.  I don't see any evidence crops will start to fail and year on year crop yields are increasing.  A part of that has to do with technology advances.

Any farmer will tell you cold is the enemy.  This years early cold snaps could mean a decrease in crop yields.

The only negative I can see from warmer weather where it comes to food production would be if desertification was occurring, which it isn't.

In general crops do better the warmer it is in crop growing regions but obviously it doesnt apply to all crops.  But it does apply to almost all of the crop we produce the most of.

There perhaps is a stage where the climate changes so much that crop growing regions shift either north or south but I don't know what those limits are and so far it appears to be beneficial.

As much as people will hate to admit it increased CO2 plays its part too in boosting crop yields.

Consider this claim in the white paper

>Indeed, the impact of methane from animal agriculture alone is 37% of 46.9 Gt CO2e, which works out to 17.3 Gt CO2e. This exceeds the impact of all fossil fuel based CO2 emissions, which is 87% of 17.6 Gt Co2, which works out to 15.3 Gt CO2.

The derivation of this result in the paper is easy to follow, and so it's obvious to see how it cherry-picks, and contorts actual data to come to this misleading result. As the paper explains there are different methods of estimating global warming potential (GWP) and different timeframes to choose from. Shorter timeframes necessarily prioritize GHGs with shorter lifetimes like methane.^(1) This paper elects to use GWP^(10) instead of the more conventional GWP^(100), or even GWP^(20), this will **necessarily** emphasize methane. GWP^(10) for methane is ≈  130, compared to GWP^(100) (incl. cloud effects) which is ≈ 34.

>If we used GWP of 130 for methane, then the annual emissions of methane would be 0.363 x 130 = 46.9 Gt CO2e, which exceeds the annual emissions of CO2 (39 Gt CO2).

But if we used GWP of 34, which properly takes into account the relevant longer lifespan of CO2 over the next century of climate policy we would instead arrive at a figure of ≈ 12 Gt CO2e.

>Since just 45% of the annual CO2 emissions remains airborne\[29\] each year, the comparison of methane (46.9 Gt CO2e) should be with respect to 0.45 x 39 = 17.6 Gt CO2.

Now this is where Rao truly goes off the rails, because he is no longer comparing like-with-like, which is to say, he is no longer doing science. Rao insists that we multiply CO2 emissions by the airborne fraction (the fraction of emitted CO2 that remains in the atmosphere; sources - sinks). Rao is correct that the airborne fraction is ≈ 0.45. *But Rao fails to do the same for methane!* So, he is comparing (sources - sinks) of CO2 with (sources) of CH4, apples and oranges! There is no clear figure for the airborne fraction of CH4, however, according to the Global Methane Budget,^(2) the average global annual CH4 emissions from anthropogenic sources over 2008-2017 was 328 Tg CH4 yr^(-1), while the change in abundance in the atmosphere was 13 Tg CH4 yr^(-1). Therefore, assuming all of the change was from anthropogenic emissions of methane, then we arrive at an approximate airborne fraction of 4%. Thus, the corrected estimate of agricultural methane emissions is,

    0.363 (Gt CH4/yr) x 34 (GWP100) x 37% (fraction from agriculture) x 4% (airborne fraction) = 0.18 Gt CO2e/yr. [Retained by atmosphere]

If we were to set aside the whole airborne fraction complication and simply compare emissions then,

    0.363 (Gt CH4/yr) x 34 (GWP100) x 37% (fraction from agriculture) = 4.6 Gt CO2e/yr. [Net emissions]

4.6/39 = ≈12%. But we haven't considered non-agricultural methane, nor CO2 directly from agriculture. If you were to do this then you would arrive at the ≈14.5% figure cited by the IPCC.  I hope that this alone will demonstrate the amount of credibility this non-peer-reviewed white paper has, zero.

Climatechange,post,agriculture,jr8ct6,1r0nymous,"Dissecting climate and weather change into two separate, deteriorating commons from the same common positive externality.","We will start by defining terms going backwards.

Oxford language dictionary defines an externality as: ""a side effect or consequence of an industrial or commercial activity that affects other parties without this being reflected in the cost of the goods or services involved, such as the pollination of surrounding crops by bees kept for honey.""

Note, the example they give is one of a positive externality from the perspective of the flowers getting pollen, and a negative externality for the flours loosing pollen. Note, the ""positive"" and ""negative"" labels, do not reference an associated value (the flour values losing its own pollen for others), but instead reference the adding or subtracting of a definable good or service. (Note: the difference is sometimes ambiguous, as collecting of pollen could be a positive provided service, or a negative removal of something, tho both are good, and they describe the same thing.) Also, the bees get some substantial food for being the middle bees, but arguably too much to replenish the flowering pollen on their own, as these pollen sources represent a common niche, which may be susceptible to the 'tragedy of the commons.'

A commons (same reference)\[2\]: ""land or resources belonging to or affecting the whole of a community.""

The two commons we will be discussing here as they relate to Global climate and weather, is the predictability of ""this time next years'"" Average temperature, AND its variance (or standard deviation).

From the perspective of the above, we can view the unpredictable nature of next years temperature, in terms of both accuracy and precision as two separate effective, but possibly manageable, degradations of a roughly 2,000 year old solar-lunar combined ""complete"" calendar system. This calendar discovery made it easier for all who learned of it to predict the temperature and day length of ""this time next year"" with unprecedented accuracy AND precision. That's 4 separate immaterial, non-rival-rouse, and non-exclude-able commons from one positive externality. Only two of these are most immediately degrading as examined by this paper.

To examine degradation trends of these commons in depth, and what can be done about it(them), we will look at who they most impacted, and demographic shifts that resulted.

Up until the development of this positive externality, Rome was using two different positive externalities for time keeping, a less effective lunar-only calendar, whose months where a significantly different temperature every year, and the sun dial(still basically used today wrt base 12/60, and not base 10,50,100, or something provably more intuitive). I would argue that Plautus would give more leeway to the man who invented the sundial today, if he'd be able to know that it would have taken nearly 3,000 years for digital 7 segment displays to be made to make the Greek invention more intuitive wrt human anatomy. That said, we do still effectively use the system he was complaining about, just with a more advanced annual calendar (and definition of a second -.-).

But back to that calendar. What this solar lunar calendar did (the newer ones that were closer to 365.25days like the Julian and Gregorian calendars), is allow farmers to better plan when to grow and harvest crops. Thus, as Rome was expanding into military, commerce, and slavery, farmers found a better way that didn't need Rome. This led, in part, to the eventual transition back to a larger% of the labor market being involved in, local scale, city-state agriculture, and the moving of the empires' capital to Ancient Constantinople.

&#x200B;

This new distribution of labor persisted for a while, mostly up until the industrial revolution, and modern history. From here, citizens have been entangled to these commons, and as the advancement of socializing modern monopolies that would otherwise exert an externalized dead weight loss for society has been leveraged(like socializing the military out of the hand of King George), society has flourished. We have provided markets for more niches, and the %of labor needed for food production has gone back down, to societys' great benefit. (both long and short term, but esp short).

However, as this % trends back downwards, the opportunity for abuse and degradation of these commons (this externality) by private and/or public interests, should not be understated. Specifically, I would like to take this opportunity to warn that if, say, 6-9 of the 10 most profitable/revenue generating companies on the planet are oil and/or fossil fuel companies that (theoretically could) profit from the accelerated degradation of BOTH of these commons, and/or play social media games by diverting between both issues, that external market intervention may be needed at an international scale to match the scale of the problem, possibly more wrt Kardashev theory needing to be solved. (if some people have unworkable plans to leave the planet instead of being a part of a successful egg that hatches inwards, then further complications may arise both terrestrially and elsewhere.)

Thank you, and I look forward to productive peer review.

Peer review is the evaluation of work by one or more people with similar competencies as the producers of the work (peers). It functions as a form of self-regulation by qualified members of a profession within the relevant field. Peer review methods are used to maintain quality standards, improve performance, and provide credibility. In academia, scholarly peer review is often used to determine an academic paper's suitability for publication.

Extreme or unusual weather (especially from on moment in time to the next), can be seen as an increasing uncertainty, or SD, with respect to the sample set of weather patterns. (both the average weather is changing, AND the variance of it.) Specific data can be found in global average temperature, ocean temperature, ice melt, and other affected climate measures.

The direct underlying positive externality is, as you correctly pointed out, the discoveries with respect to orbital dynamics as they manifest under the geocentric model that existed 2,000+ years ago.

> This is calculated by orbital mechanics, not ""positive externalities.""

Specifically, the calendar was a pre helio-centric model discovery that accounted for orbital dynamics before the common knowledge of orbital dynamics existed(also an abstract common meme, but stronger).

I think evaluating memes as common positive externalizations, capable of deteriorating despite their immaterial nature, could be a useful perspective.

Research is focused on other aspects like geology/biology/history and doesn't try to answer the question 'can we counter rising sea levels by storing water in the Sahara?'.

I think it is possible. Parts of the Sahara have been seas a long time ago and more recently (I think something like 10-20k years ago) were part of a fresh water system. Large parts are below sea level and an Saharan ocean could potentially store a lot of water, close to the amount of water stored in glaciers.

If the Sahara is used as a man made water storage it has to be a salt water sea, probably connected to the Mediterranean sea. I think pumped fresh water lakes are unrealistic. A Saharan sea would impact the local environment and provide more arable land because of increased precipitation.

But I don't think it is achievable in the short term for political reasons. It is just hard to imagine Northern African countries working together on a project like this. Countries in this region aren't capable of providing running water and electricity to its citizens and are unlikely to work together on a project like this without starting a war. Reclaiming large parts of the Sahara (which I think humankind will achieve) is likely to be a evolutionary process, not a revolutionary one like creating a sea. I think local projects with a more direct, tangible, return are more likely to succeed, like food production or electricity/hydrogen production.

Unfortunately it has been a while since I've looked into this and I can't provide any sources anymore. But for entertainment I think this are quite nice resources and they might offer a starting point for a more thorough investigation:

13 gallons of gas = the tank size of a midsized Honda. 
I used to use about 4 tanks of gas in about a month, back when i drove. So 1000 pounds or a ton of co2 a month. Per car, a very rough estimate. 

And this was very minor. I did it go shopping or go to work.

On the other hand, every action i could do with that kind of positive footprint, such as grow an equivalent  amount of plants to capture a ton of co2, is a huge undertaking. Planting a sapling or running a small algae farm is not normal, expensive, and has its own footprint to consider. 

So i dont think our current market based systems are going to pull us out of this. Buying a purse made of algae leather, having it delivered by electric car powered only by solar wind and hydro seems great. Nearly impossible to cleanly incentivize. But great. 

But if you still drive a car, and live in countries with millions of SUVs, then it's greenwashing.

* Pollen studies show that tree cover in wisconson changed suddenly in less than a century at the end of the Younger Dryas. (Carbon 14 dates and pollen species)
* Ice cores from greenland shows rapid changes. 
* Mud cores from the Gulf of mexico showing evidence of very rapid ocean depth changes.

This is both scary and hopefull to me.

Scary in the sense that there is some evidence of very rapid sea level changes on the order of meters per decade. (Current change is about 3 cm/decade)  Some evidence that temps have changed several degrees in less than a decade.

A meter per decade is peanuts to a hunter gatherer group.  Even on shallow shorelines a meter rise is less than a kilometer inland.

3 meters per decade will sharply reduce the value of coastal real estate. 

A 3 degree warmer climate may change the diet of hunter gatherers.  But it may drop Kansas wheat harvest by 18%

A 6 degree warmer climate (our forecast for prairie at 55 latitude) changes forested land to prairie, and is going to seriously change the face of agriculture.

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,gsd11xc,kearsargeII,,"There isn't any real mystery how the Younger Dryas ended. The start, as you said, is likely the result of a meltwater pulse into the Arctic or North Atlantic that caused the AMOC to shut down. This cooled the North Atlantic, which made ice expand in the northern hemisphere. As Ice is white, and reflects light, more of the northern hemisphere being covered in ice leads to more solar energy being reflected back into space, and less solar energy warming the earth. During the entire time that the Younger Dryas was occurring, the Milankovitch cycles were still running and shifting further along from an ice age to a warm period. While there was more ice, the net solar input into the earth was increasing the entire time, and the end of the Younger Dryas marks the point where the solar energy input got strong enough to reverse the cooling trend started by the expansion of the ice sheets. I have seen a good half dozen theories for how the theorized meltwater pulse occured, but I have not seen more than one theory for how the Younger Dryas ended.

Another younger dryas is unlikely as we are right in the middle of an interglacial. Even if the AMOC is shut down by a meltwater pulse from Greenland, it still won't be enough cooling in the northern hemisphere to cause ice sheets to expand enough that a second Younger Dryas starts.

That being said, that is largely irrelevant, as it isn't global cooling that people are concerned about.",2021-03-27T00:35:42+00:00,,,,,,,,,,
Climatechange,post,agriculture,n0jwxh,tarrelhunter,Climate change impacts in agriculture in The Netherlands,"So I’m currently doing my thesis on the impacts of climatic trends in agriculture in the Netherlands, especially (agricultural) droughts. Though it would be nice to share some information on this subject to help climate impact feel more tangible.

Since 2018 the Netherlands has experienced above climatic average drought conditions during the summer months. These droughts have increasingly challenged agricultural crop production. In 2018, maize yields on sandy soils saw a reduction in the 70% range as it proved to be very poorly resistant to extreme drought. While reductions in potato crops ranged up to 20% to 25% for unirrigated plots. In total, the damages as a result of the 2018 drought was estimated at between 375 million to 1.9 billion euros.

First of all to clear the air, let me say that yes, due to the increased CO2 fertilization effect we can expect plants to be more water efficient during the photosynthesis process. However, this is a mechanism often taken out of context by climate pseudo-sceptics. The mechanism holds well for processes at the leaf level which are often studied using controlled laboratory experiments, but one should caution when upscaling this relation from the leaf level to ecosystem level such as a crop architecture where the multiple confounding effects of the real world come into play.

You see, it’s really nice that plants start to become more water efficient under higher CO2 concentrations, but that holds no value anymore once the soil is close to or completely rid of any soil water the plant can access at all. At that point, which we call the wilting point, the photosynthesis process can no longer take place, as the plant no longer has access to water which, by splitting into O2 and the H+ proton under sunlight, provides the critically needed energy for the photosynthetic process. Also, plants cool down by transpiring water from their leaves, just as we humans do as we sweat. Once water becomes limited, plants can no longer shed their heat and start to get sunburned or photosynthesis is reduced due to the enzymes disliking to function at such temperatures. What also should be noted is that an increase in water use efficiency only covers transpiration from the plant leaves, and thus does not include the expected increase in evaporation of water directly from the soil projected to come with climate change which in turn influences the total available soil moisture a plant can use to transpire.

We think that we are increasingly starting to see that here in the Netherlands an increase in water use efficiency (WUE) only delays the occurrence of droughts in agriculture. In the end, the higher efficiency does not outweigh the increases in evapotranspiration and temperature in the long run. It’s a bit like driving the same distance with a more fuel-efficient car as you did with your older car, but with not enough gas to make it to your destination. Crops can benefit from from the increased WUE for a period of time in the growing season, but in the end it loses the battle anyway when there's very little or no water available at all anymore in the high summer months, which are often critical periods for plants in which they normally put energy in developing the botanical parts we humans are interested in (e.g. the potatoes tubers / maize cobs). On top of that, potatoes start to grow very poorly at temperatures above 25 degrees celcius, temperatures which are easily being surpassed by well over 10 degrees celcius in recent years, up to a record 40.9 degrees celcius in the summer of 2019 and more and more days on which get close to such temperatures.

Recently I’ve went through some papers which indicated that due to higher temperatures in the spring, as we’ve seen in the past few years, summer droughts in agriculture are exacerbated. This is due to natural vegetation starting to grow earlier and thus transpiring soil water earlier in the year. Under a lack of precipitation, this reduces the water crops can take up from the soil.

Despite our drought problems, precipitation has actually increased by 26% in the Netherlands in the past 100 years. The problem is that these increases are primarily featured during the winter months. Precipitation events in the summer have become concentrated in more intense showers with more water falling from the sky per unit of time. These intense precipitation events tighten the ground very quickly causing overland flow of water so that precipitation is quickly discharged into streams which discharge the water away from the farming systems quickly, and the water does not infiltrate into the soil instead. This immediately lays bare an important issue in the design of the farming landscape in the Netherlands; we have designed our agricultural landscape to be able to be discharged easily in case of excessive amounts of water flooding our lands which we are known for to have been battling for hundreds of years. Now these systems designed to easily transport water away, which we often still need during the winter, cause water to be transported away too quickly in the summer months when it’s needed on the fields. So, by fixing one problem mostly occurring during winter, we exacerbate another one during the summer.

Another important boundary conditions from which the water in the soil develops is the groundwater table. I’ve looked up the data on the groundwater monitoring wells in the area I’m from (which is dominated by sandy soils) and since 2015 the average groundwater table has decreased by up to 60 cm on average. Let’s say from about 80 cm for a plot I’m studying, to about 140 cm, and the trend is continuing downward up to this date. Sure the groundwater gets filled up in the winter to about the same amount every year, but the replenishment has increasingly been outweighed by the increased evapotranspiration in the summer.

Now I’ve talked to farmers in the area which are suffering from these droughts (When I was young I’ve always had side jobs in agriculture myself). They have to spend much more time, energy and money to maintain their crops, and still these efforts do not guarantee an acceptable crop yield. Of course, this is impacting their finances, and there’s been increasing discussion on the feasibility of current agricultural practices in the Netherlands.

Note that this post focusses on droughts in relation to agriculture. For natural ecosystems, however, the droughts have had similar negative impacts. Streams run dry from which fish have to be rescued, animals are suffering from heat stress, there’s been an increase in forest fires and peat gets oxidized causing problematic land subsidence. This is occurring in already problematic times for the natural environment suffering from excessive nitrogen usage by farmers and subsequent biodiversity loss.

We are seeing some other severely negative impacts of climate change in The Netherlands. Theses include land subsidence, salt water intrusion, adverse psychological affects of heat and damage to infrastructure, but I would like to come back to these topics later in different posts.",2021-04-28T17:21:46+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,gw7j70o,tarrelhunter,,"I think I have a very simple answer as to why climate change is often viewed as bad, and that's simply because we've developed very stiff societies which are very dependent on predictable environmental conditions to be met with a certain degree of certainty. We see climate change as to how it affects ourselves and our societies and since acting upon this often requires time and energy (and thus money) and often human lives, we view it as a bad thing.

For example, in the context of agriculture I'm expecting to be able to grow a certain crop over a growing season at a certain location because I know kind of what the weather will be like over the growing season from past experiences; not too cold, not too hot, just enough precipitation, etc. Climate change makes all of this much more uncertain, and that's difficult when you have invested into your company and have to pay back loans. You have to make extra expenses to cope with these uncertainties. On the other hand you have increasing chances that the weather will fall far outside of the bandwidth you know it's often mostly occurring within, like extreme heats or droughts for example, or extreme cold and severe precipitation.

To me there's no objective good or bad in the world apart from our norms and values, which are subjective things we have developed our selves. In this sense I don't think as climate change as something bad necessarily, just bad for how societies currently operate and we just have to put a lot of effort in adapting to the new conditions. I think people on this subreddit are often way too dramatic about climate change, going on and on about how it's the end of the world. Yes it imposes numerous challenges to us and societies are affected very unequally and I'm expecting a lot of people with poor adaptive capabilities will have to pay for it with their lives, but it's definitely not the end of the world.

Btw, I'm not studying man made climate change. Rather, I'm studying earth system sciences. I'm just really interested in looking into the relations we observe within system earth and find out how everything is so interconnected.

You link this to climate change at the very end of your post but without any real evidence. 

As though this has never happened before.   Yet I'd you look back in history it certainly has multiple times.

In 1976 literally 10 years after man made climate change was invented you had equally bad droughts. Then look back even further.

I don't disagree the climate changes but in this case it appears to just be repeating previous cycles.

Farmers always bitch.  Really old ones will remember way way way harder times than now.

Evapotranspiration is an issue during a drought period for sure.  But is it worse than in the past with increased precipitation?  The records likely don't go back far enough in enough detail to know and do we deplete reserves faster due to more farming than in the past as well as larger populations of people?  All simple logical reasons rather than blaming it on a 0.7C increase in temperature.

Also doesn't make sense to blame it on a global warming when the droughts are not global and specifically arn't globally increasing and may have even decreased.

It seems more logical to say it's a natural cycle.  But that won't fit with the narrative of your thesis and the narrative you are fed in universities.

Also crop yields world wide are at records year on year.  Growth every year.    Increased CO2 is one reason.  Increased precipitation is another.  Increased temperatures is another ( you know warmth bad... actually no warmth good).  Cold is bad.  This year specifically I think we will see a dip in crop yeilds as harsh cold winters that have hit early and are breaking records day by day.

But again these records are being broken by 0.1 to 0.3C,. Very small numbers all events that have occured before.  Not overly unexpected in a naturally changing climate.

But a bit unexpected when CO2 levels are so high and temps should be rocketing.

So a bit surprising natural variability is able to overpower CO2 so easily when it shouldn't be able to.",2021-04-28T19:47:05+00:00,,,,,,,,,,
Climatechange,comment,agriculture,gw7qziq,tarrelhunter,,"I'm very much aware of the 1976 drought. But in contrast, the more recent droughts are more systematic in nature and have seemed to have exacerbate the drought the following year and correlate with record high temperatures. Drought creates more drought, as less water available for evapotranspiration increases the sensible heat flow causing higher temperature and hence more (potential) evapotranspiration. 1976 still is the driest year we've ever experienced in the Netherlands as far as the record goes.

For this text I do have seemed to link these droughts to climate change, but of course I know that one should caution to link a few events to climate change directly. For now they are at best a warning sign of what climate projections tell us is going to occur more frequently in the future. I actually wrote in my thesis proposal that it can't really be said that these droughts are part of climate change (yet).

And no, there doesn't have to be a global increase in droughts to justify linking an increase in droughts in Western Europe to climate change because one of the most important characteristics of our global climate system is the transportation of energy.

When you're talking about the 0.7 degrees increase in temperature you are of course talking about average temperature, which is a major difference.

Yes water shortages are also caused by the way we farm, and this in turn influences regional climate. With our irrigated agriculture we are likely to put more water into the atmosphere than natural vegetation would do, so you can expect our global societies' massive farming operations to impact weather on the long term and thus climate. Public awareness on water savings is especially a problem in the Netherlands, since the public opinion is that we think of our water resources as taken for granted, which erodes our willingness to do something about it now we actually have to.

Of course it's all a natural cycle, but that doesn't mean that we don't have an impact on that natural cycle. Like I said in another comment, everything is interconnected. It's just the question how sensitive each connection is.

And it really isn't only on the fields we see evidence of droughts. It's in the natural ecosystem as well as land subsidence which is becoming a major issue in the Western Netherlands.

Developments in tons / ha yield increases are primarily caused by closing the yield gaps by selective plant breeding and advances in agricultural practices. The contribution to closing these yield gaps is exactly where the university I'm studying at is known for. The problem with attributing global yield increases solely to the CO2 fertilization effect is that for crops in many farming systems around the world, CO2 often is not the limiting factor, but water availability and nutrients are (Liebig's law of the minimum). And proper use of fertilizers and pest control are likely to have a large impact as well.",2021-04-28T20:25:53+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Compare that to if natural vegetation was there it wouldn't be all thatuch different, albeit there would be a difference.  In the grand scheme compared to what comes from the oceans it would be fractional.

I think you just inexplicably debunked CO2 causes global warming.

If for example what you said wasn't fractional in comparison and human farming did significantly increase water vapor and by association cloud cover, then this alone would more than account for any warming considering just 1% change in cloud cover can account for any warming or cooling.

Water vapor is also 30x more potant than CO2.

Wouldn't this then cause a run away warming that got out of control if all it takes is more greenhouse gases then more greenhouse gasses cause more warming and more gasses to be produced?

In theory it should.  But the theory can't be correct or it would never end. There is far more to it and greenhouse gases play a far lesser role especially CO2.

We know for sure it's warm now.  But it's been warm before.  We know for sure warming produces more precipitation as more water vapor is outgassed from the oceans.

Global records are showing a decline in drought.  Sure some places may have a increase since records began. But is it significant? No.  In order to have a decrease globally it means regionally most places are seeing a decrease in drought, so your regional argument falls over.

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,gw7zy1v,tarrelhunter,,"Watch out for the definition game. Academically we often describe drought in several ways. These include meteorological drought, hydrological drought, agricultural drought, socio-economic drought, etc. For example it is possible that while meteorological droughts decrease, agricultural droughts increase. These concepts often get mixed up and cause confusion. Now you've said that, I should've been more elaborate on that in my post. I can't offer very solid information on droughts globally increasing or decreasing in the world in general since I haven't studied droughts on a global scale in depth, but I know that global averages can be very misleading as climatic impacts can regionally be very differnt.

Also, as can be deduced from my text, more precipitation doesn't necessarily mean that this increase in precipitation is accessible for plant growth and thus alleviating (hydrological or agricultural) drought. Furthermore, increased precipitation can actually correlate with increases in droughts, especially when these are very local intense showers. It's all about the context, the localization, timing and intensity of the precipitation.

Iirc, evapotranspiration can be measured on larger scales fairly accurately using satellite in orders of magnitude (I myself am using satellite data on water content in plants as measured from satellites in my thesis research, known as Vegetation Optical Depth). This introduces the problem however that atmospheric water vapor is extremely variable in space and time. This is why water vapor is never in atmospheric composition descriptions.

Increased water in the atmosphere due to increased evapotranspiration induced by farming also saturates the atmosphere more quickly after which water precipitates from the atmosphere. Hence, the average stored water in the atmosphere stays about the same. This is because the maximum amount of water in a volume of atmosphere is dependent on the temperature of the air as described by the Clausius Clapeyron relationship.

It appears that for the largest part, temperature and water vapor as a greenhouse gas have feedbacked into each other to establish temperatures for the recent state of the climate and have reached a kind of equilibrium or saturation effect. This can be changed by an increase in CO2 which allows the air to become warmer, and in turn is able to hold more water which again would increase temperature further. This is known as the water vapor feedback.

It thus can be said that water vapor is kind of a 'secondary effect' greenhouse gas in the current state of the climate system as further influences of water vapor on the climate system is dependent on an initial temperature increase from another driver within the climate system, which can be other greenhouse gases such as CO2. And thus to answer your question on the runaway affect; this is constrained by the Clausius Clapeyron relationship. With this knowledge, you might want to review your stances, as they do now not hold up with our general understanding of the atmosphere.

On the other hand, more water vapor can also produce more clouds which decrease the albedo of the earth. That's why you'll find a large uncertainty margin for the effect of water vapor in the atmosphere on temperature in the IPCC reports. The true effect of water vapor in the atmosphere is kind of the million dollar question in climate sciences, but how it behaves is likely to be very context dependent.",2021-04-28T21:29:16+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,gw84g73,tarrelhunter,,"First of all it wouldn't necessarily always negate the effect. The effects are highly dependent on local contexts and very a lot between crops and cultivars. I just want to warn that it's not as straightforward as often depicted. 

That said, plants can benefit well from the CO2 fertilization effect making them more water efficient. It's just that along with the increase in CO2 it's expected that prolonged meteorological droughts are more likely to occur as well in some places which would negate the effect of increased WUE once the soil reaches wilting point. 

But the confounding effects of leaves for example are leaves overlapping and shading over each other. It's also important if the canopy of the crop leaves parts of the soil exposed or not. To understand this it's important that we consider both evaporation and transpiration here, together known as evapotranspiration. Evaporation is the water which changes phase from liquid to vapor from the soil or surface water, while transpiration is water that changes phase from liquid to vapor from the crop itself. An increase in water use efficiency only says something about the transpiration from the leaves of the plant and not evaporation of water from the soil. Evaporation of water from the soil is likely to increase with an increase in temperatures from an increase of CO2. It thus might be so that while a plant becomes more efficient in it's water use, the available water in the soil also decreases due to the increased evaporation. Like the car example I used; your engine might become more efficient, but it might just be that your fuel tank has shrunk so much that in the end you're not able to drive as far as you are used to. That's also why the canopy architecture is important. If your canopy  quickly grows and leaves little to no soil exposed to the sun less water evaporates and the crop might benefit more from the increase in water use efficiency. It is however, very dependent on other conditions, such as crop type, cultivar, sowing date, row spacing, etc.",2021-04-28T22:03:01+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Climatechange,post,agriculture,o1qm1w,ralloti,A question on vertical farming (and plant based diets),"Having recently seen a post on Instagram by plantbasednews saying a vegan needs just 1/6 of an acre of land for one year of food, it got me thinking about how food production can be altered. 

Having read about vertical farming before, I checked out some articles and sources and it has been suggested it can be up to 600x more efficient than traditional crop growth.

So now, only 0.00028 acres of land is needed per vegan. Multiplied by the UK population, that’s 18514 acres. Seems like a lot of vertical farms to build? Well the Tesla gigs factory is 126 acres, so it’s less that 150 of those. 

This is in comparison to the 23 million acres currently used for agriculture in the UK. 

Benefits include growing crops year round, being able to grow produce not native to the location, disease and weather resistance, as well as returning farming land to natural habitats for wildlife. 

I know the whole of the UK isn’t going vegan anytime soon, and I also appreciate the numbers maybe a “best case” scenario, but why is there not a bigger push for this? Why isn’t it being done on a larger scale? Why are governments not seeing it as an easy win?

There are some challenges though. The biggest is that it works better with smaller plants (because you can stack more tiers of them easily) which we eat most of by weight. So leafy greens are were most of the action is.

Plants like tomatoes, potatos, berries, etc. will need to be bred to be shorter and have smaller leaves, vines and other non-eadible parts for ideal results. While plants like wheat, rice and corn which are tall and provide relatively little edible product are going to be big challenges.

Don't be too quick with that assumption. While renewable energy like solar and wind allow us to reduce carbon footprint of energy production, these solutions generally come with other environmental trade-offs. Both solar and wind are technologies that require metals that often have a high geo-political scarcity and substantial environmental pollution in their production.

Vertical farming is for sure something we should consider further, but we should not consider it a silver bullet.

Climatechange,post,agriculture,oh97r6,sleep_like_the_dead,Want to know what happens in a. hundred years? Read this,"Came across the wiki page for the Easter Island, off The Chilean coast in the South Pacific:

&#x200B;

*Archeological record shows that at the time of the initial settlement the island was home to many species of trees, including at least three species which grew up to 15 metres (49 ft) or more. At least six species of land birds were known to live on the island. Barbara A. West wrote, ""Sometime before the arrival of Europeans on Easter Island, the Rapanui experienced a tremendous upheaval in their social system brought about by a change in their island's ecology... By the time of European arrival in 1722, the island's population had dropped to 2,000–3,000 from a high of approximately 15,000 just a century earlier.""*  


*By that time, 21 species of trees and all species of land birds became extinct through some combination of over-harvesting, over-hunting, rat predation, and climate change. The island was largely deforested, and it did not have any trees taller than 3 m (9.8 ft). Loss of large trees meant that residents were no longer able to build seaworthy vessels, significantly diminishing their fishing abilities. One theory is that the trees were used as rollers to move the statues to their place of erection from the quarry at Deforestation also caused erosion which caused a sharp decline in agricultural production. This was exacerbated by the loss of land birds and the collapse in seabird populations as a source of food.*   


*As the island became overpopulated and resources diminished, warriors known as matatoa gained more power and the Ancestor Cult ended, making way for the Bird Man Cult. Beverly Haun wrote, ""The concept of mana (power) invested in hereditary leaders was recast into the person of the birdman, apparently beginning circa 1540, and coinciding with the final vestiges of the moai period."" This cult maintained that, although the ancestors still provided for their descendants, the medium through which the living could contact the dead was no longer statues but human beings chosen through a* ***competition.***  


competition here results in strength and fighting tournaments.

Basically, once humans exhausted the island's natural resources, population dropped 80% in a century, violence erupted and the survival of the fittest kicked in and violent leaders took hold of power.  
And the fact that they were still cutting down the large remaining trees to use as rollers for their stone statues... Could there be a better metaphor for our obsession with status quo?

&#x200B;

I think this holds a lot of the keys to the future.

&#x200B;

Climate change works on a delayed exponential model: due to climate inertia, there is a lag between emissions and temperature increase. That's just like covid where there is a lag between deaths and exponential rise in cases.

&#x200B;

With covid, for every wave, people used the same arguments to whine about lockdown measures: 'cases are only 30k, and deaths are super low!'. Little did they know that mathematically, the slaughter was already a done deal. If people can't see it happening by taking a look out of their window, they refuse to believe it. They rely on hope, God or karma to sort things out so that it all takes a turn for th best.

You don't win if those buying your products are now too poor to pay, those selling you products you need no longer have them, and your country with its already collapsing infrastructure is overrun by refugees from places that have become not just difficult, but uninhabitable because they are under water or desert now.

Canada was predicted as a climate change winner, in key with their continued sell of fossil fuels, due to them being so cold. The recent heatwave cooked billions of shellfish, melted electricity cables, cracked roads, killed people of heat stroke in their houses and caused devastating wildfires.

Scandinavia was predicted as a climate change winner. We got unprecedented wildfires.

Germany was predicted as getting through mostly unscathed. It just got flooded.

Cold nations might be hit less badly, in the sense of not becoming straight up uninhabitable - but that won't mean not getting hit by extreme weather events. And our current cold nations are strongly dependent not just on their location on this planet, but the steady movement of ocean and air currents, which is getting disrupted, which can end up with them drastically shifting climate in ways that are not good, either. E.g. Scandinavia just got hit with an insanely cold winter due to Arctic weather getting screwed and basically drifting here, and there are fears the gulf stream will collapse, which would imply draught here.

Industrial nations might be hit less badly, in the sense of having more power to put into protection and being more stable.

I am not sure this is right sub to ask this question, but I'll try. I found the graphs linked above in the [Supplementary Information](http://doc.rero.ch/record/309006/files/hus_gsh_sm.pdf) for a 2018 paper by Huss and Hock, ""Global-scale hydrological response to future glacier mass loss"".

The plots represent the current and projected (RCP4.5) glacier runoff for the basins of the Po (Northern Italy, where I live) and the Columbia (I include the Columbia to illustrate that the situation of Northern Italy is not unique). According to these projections, within 30 years, the August runoff will drop consistently and the September runoff will be almost halved: this is because the current runoff of these glaciers is largely supported by loss of mass and in 30 years they will be almost completely gone.

Is there a general agreement on these predictions? What are the practical implications of this? Are these regions going to face serious lack of water (e.g. for agriculture) in a few decades? Is there anything that we should start doing now to tackle this problem (in addition to reducing GHG emissions)?

Such massive CO2 removals hinge on near-term investment to boost the future capacity for upscaling**. DAC is most cost-effective when using electricity sources already available today: hydropower and natural gas with renewables; fully renewable systems are more expensive because their low load factors do not allow efficient amortization of capital-intensive DAC plants.

>...We find that the impact of DAC on net CO2 emissions and concentrations could be substantial — reversing rising concentrations beginning in 2070–2075. **However, that reversal requires coincident mitigation equivalent to at least SSP2-4.5. Even with massive DAC deployment, substantial levels of remaining emissions in SSP2-4.5 lead to warming of 2.4–2.5 °C at the end of the century. Under scenarios of higher remaining emissions (marker SSP2), median warming in 2100 reaches 3.4 °C even with an emergency crash program for DAC**.

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,h5gxym5,chronicalpain,,"IPCC has a history of cherry picking data that fit policy makers, and hide data that falsify the hypothesis

Their own result fell between Mann’s and Briffa’s, with a clear Little Ice Age and a modern interval about as warm as the Medieval period. But since it was based on a very small data set they cautioned against reading too much into it.

John Robson

Mann’s paper, by contrast, swept aside the uncertainties. He and his coauthors claimed “moderately high levels of confidence” that the 1990s were the warmest decade, and 1998 the warmest year, of the millennium – of the last 1,000 years. And that brought the IPCC calling.

Narrator

In 1999 the IPCC was starting work on its Third Assessment Report. Out of all the people doing tree ring temperature analysis, they picked Michael Mann to write the summary.

John Robson

Jones and Briffa were invited to serve as contributors, but under IPCC rules, it’s the Lead Authors who decide what goes in. By appointing Mann, the IPCC was signalling what message they were looking for. And soon they would be even more explicit about what they were after.

Narrator

On September 1st 1999 the IPCC convened a meeting of the authors in Arusha, Tanzania, where they spent three days discussing what the first draft of the report should include. Ten years later a large library of emails among Jones, Briffa, Mann and other climate scientists would be leaked onto the internet, which is how we came to possess the inside details of what happened next.

On September 22nd 1999, three weeks after the Arusha meeting, IPCC Coordinating Lead Author Chris Folland sent around a note stating

A proxy diagram of temperature change is a clear favourite for the Policy Makers summary. But the current diagram with the tree ring only data [Briffa’s] somewhat contradicts the [Mann] multiproxy curve and dilutes the message rather significantly.

So he asked that Mann’s curve be given priority.

John Robson

Now hold on a moment. It’s 1999, almost two years before the report was due to be released and before the expert review process had even started. Yet the IPCC leadership had already decided on the “message” they wanted in the Summary for Policymakers, and they didn’t want it “diluted” even though they knew the available data was contradictory and inconclusive?

Clearly the IPCC didn’t see their job as surveying the science and writing a summary that reflected the full range of data and of opinions. Instead they decided ahead of time on a compelling message, that man-made climate change was a pressing crisis, and then they looked for the science to support it.

https://climatediscussionnexus.com/videos/climategate-hide-the-decline-backgrounder/

TLDR

By hiding the decline, they misled world leaders and citizens on an issue that they themselves judged to be critically important. They falsified data to conceal their own uncertainty and the potential unreliability of the methods they were using. And that is not how science is done.

in other words, IPCC has identified their mandate from policy makers as sending a message that pants are on fire, and they are cherry picking research that support their agenda, while hiding research that contradict their hypothesis. this is not how science is done, this is media influencers level pseudo science",2021-07-17T01:55:18+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Here's the podcast transcript:

Welcome to Beyond Money, the podcast where we discuss the technologies and businesses changing the world.  Today, we’re going to talk about Climate Change, the greatest problem humanity has ever faced.  A problem of our own creation, climate change will impact every single person’s life on this planet.  From the food that we eat, to the water that we drink, these basic necessities as well as our surrounding environments will be dramatically impacted in the future as climate change progressively continues to worsen over the coming decades.  Despite this, there’s a saying I’ve heard numerous times regarding capitalism and business.  “The greater the challenge, the greater the opportunity.”  Despite the enormous challenge and danger Climate Change presents us with, I believe it will be our greatest opportunity to create a beautiful, sustainable, and prosperous future, for all. 

Climate change isn’t a problem in the distant future, it’s a problem that our planet is dealing with right now. I’ve personally witnessed my home town experience the greatest flood it’s seen in over 100 years.  My college of Indiana University just faced one of the worst flash floods in over a century, and we all witnessed the devastating wildfires in Australia in 2020.  Climate change isn’t just wildfires in California or rising sea levels, it’s more extreme and unpredictable weather all over the globe.  It’s no surprise we’re seeing the worst wildfires globally ever, at the same time as the worst flooding ever.  In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, my hometown, I’ve witnessed in the middle of December temperatures rapidly fluctuate from 75 degrees and sunny one day to 20 degrees and snowing the next day.  75 degrees in Pittsburgh during the middle of December may sound great, but these extremely volatile weather patterns disrupt natural migration and growth cycles for both plants and animals. These extreme, unpredictable weather patterns will only continue to get worse as the amount of carbon in the atmosphere increases.  The global climate is a delicate balance, and as we continue to emit carbon into the atmosphere, we will slowly destabilize this balance.   We must all, working together, take drastic and rapid action in order to combat climate change.  We cannot be the first generation of people to provide our children with a worse future than ourselves.  I believe that all of us on Earth, working as one united people, can conquer climate change.  Climate change is too grand of a problem for any one nation to solve.  We must all be in this together, because if we aren’t, then the paradise we call Earth will quickly destabilize into a wasteland.

Fixing climate change will require dramatic, radical changes to the way we live on this planet, and it all starts with the very fuel that powers our world, oil. Oil and fossil fuels are destroying our planet, and it’s all because of the way we power our homes, cities, ships, cars, and planes.  While fossil fuels are incredibly energy dense, the way we power our planet must change.  Oil and natural gas still make up over 80% of the US’s energy consumption, and globally, fossil fuels make up 79% of total energy production. However, despite much of the energy production currently being fossil fuels, this is rapidly changing.  In 2019, wind and solar energy represented 72% of all energy capacity installed, meaning the vast majority of companies expanding electricity generation are choosing renewables over fossil fuel alternatives.  This can all be explained by one thing: cost. The cost to produce energy from solar, wind, and other renewables has greatly reduced over the past decade.  For example, the cost to generate electricity from solar energy has dropped from $359/Mwh in 2009 to just $40/Mwh in 2019, an 80% decrease in just 10 years.  Solar went from being the most expensive option to the least expensive option, all within a decade.  Electricity from wind has dramatically lowered in cost as well, with costs decreasing 70% over the same time period from $135/Mwh to $41/MwH. Now, it is cheaper on average to build solar and wind energy, versus ANY other type of energy.  

Now why did this happen?  Max Roser, from Our World in Data, explains: 

“The costs of fossil fuels and nuclear power depend largely on two factors, the price of the fuel that they burn and the power plant’s operating costs.  Renewable energy plants are different: their operating costs are comparatively low and they don’t have to pay for any fuel; their fuel doesn’t have to be dug out of the ground, their fuel – the wind and sunlight – comes to them. What is determining the cost of renewable power is the cost of the power plant, the cost of *the technology itself*.” 

As we can now see, it’s all about economies of scale. As we’ve scaled solar and wind energy production, it’s driven down the cost of those technologies, driving further economies of scale and therefore further demand.  More solar or wind deployment leads to prices falling, which in turn leads to more applications for solar or wind energy, which then leads to further demand and deployment of these technologies.  This positive feedback loop continues indefinitely.  To see this positive feedback loop and it’s dramatic impact, we can simply zoom out and look at the cost of renewable technologies over the long term.  For example, the price of solar modules has decreased 99.6% since 1976.  How dramatic is that! 99.6%!  This is the magic of technology and economies of scale, more growth leads to lower costs, which leads to even more growth.

Now while solar and wind technology are rapidly decreasing in cost, they still have one fundamental flaw.  The sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow.  How do we solve this problem, as electricity demand globally is constant, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Fortunately, we have some of the smartest minds working to solve this problem.  Tesla has developed cutting edge battery storage products which will store solar or wind energy in lithium-ion batteries, completely changing everything.  Now, solar energy generated during the day can be stored in these batteries, and distributed for use during night, even when the sun isn’t shining.  A combined solution of solar and wind energy generation with battery storage, now makes this energy available for use, 24/7.  And as battery costs continue to decline, the prospect of such a system only grows more appealing.  This is what gives me hope for the future.  These incredible technologies are becoming more accessible to more regions of the world due to these steep cost declines and fundamental improvements. With the fundamental problem of solar and wind energy now solved with a battery-based energy storage solution, there’s no reason why the entire world can’t be powered by sustainable energy. I’m not saying shut down all fossil fuel plants tomorrow, however, as this would cause a societal collapse.  We still rely on fossil fuels for critical infrastructure in the United States and around the globe.  What I’m truly advocating for is an accelerated push towards sustainable technology, as fast as possible, from everyone.  The technology is ready and here today, it’s all a matter of scaling production and distributing it to the world.

Now obviously scaling such a solution will require an immense amount of resources, talent and capital, yet I believe it will get done since this will be the world’s greatest economic opportunity. There is simply too much money to be made by building and deploying sustainable energy technology, as everyone on the planet will need it. The amount of jobs required to scale production, distribute, and deploy sustainable energy technology will be immense.  I believe scaling sustainable energy technology will generate tens of millions of jobs globally, with many of those jobs being in developing countries.  As these countries modernize and industrialize, they will demand sustainable energy solutions since they will all have rapidly increasing demand for electricity as their populations grow and standards of living rise. Solar and wind plants combined with batteries will be cheaper than any fossil fuel solution, so it’ll be a no-brainer to use sustainable technology solutions in these countries.  All of these regions will need an immense amount of people to distribute and maintain these technologies, which will help the economies of these regions. When fully distributed, sustainable energy technology will bring a rapid expansion of cheap electricity to regions that have never had power.  People in these regions will be able to have access to the internet, clean drinking water, and sanitary food for the first time.  Think of the innovation that will result globally, with these tools now at everyone’s disposal.  It makes it a lot easier to innovate and solve problems when you don’t have to find clean drinking water and food every day.

Now climate change isn’t all about the carbon emissions, although it plays the greatest role.  Our impact can be felt in other ways, such as the fertilizers we use in our agricultural fields and the deforestation activity we engage in to support growing crops, livestock, and other activities. Runoff from our agricultural fields into our rivers and oceans is killing huge amounts of marine life, and all ecosystems are delicate and connected.  Having a diverse ecosystem of life on the planet is crucial to our long-term survival, as diversity of life creates a robust global ecosystem that provides us with a variety of nutrients from various plants and animals.  When we destabilize this delicate global ecosystem, things quickly get out of hand.  Humanity’s overfishing has caused many marine ecosystems to collapse, dramatically reducing the amount of fish in the ocean, as many fish rely on other fish or marine plants to survive.  Fertilizers and other chemicals from human activities are also causing many coastal reef ecosystems to collapse, dramatically reducing the amount of food available for other marine life as well as ourselves.  We must figure out a way to sustainably manage our marine ecosystems, or else this trend will continue to worsen.  As the global population continues to rise, the importance of this will only increase, as we will have to balance an ever-increasing demand for food with a smaller and smaller pool of marine life.  If we eat all of the food in the ocean, we will starve.   We must find a balance.  Every ecosystem on the planet relies on another ecosystem, whether its bears relying on fish from the ocean or plants relying on bees to pollinate them.  As we disrupt this balance by destroying ecosystems, our problems will only continue to worsen.  Luckily for us, innovative companies are coming up with creative solutions to help us with our ever-growing food and protein demands.  We’ll dive deeper into this in the next podcast.

In conclusion, despite the immense problem climate change poses and the deteriorating situation currently, I believe humanity will perservere.  With the world’s greatest talent flocking to companies that solve this problem, I believe in human ingenuity and the belief that anything is possible.  I personally will be taking my talents to a company that fights climate change, as I see no greater cause to fight for.  A future where the Earth is a lush, green paradise, where we breathe clean air and live sustainably is a future I desire, and I strive to help create it. We must attack the problem of climate change from all fronts, not just one vector.  We must eat sustainably, power our homes sustainably, travel sustainably, and manage our surrounding ecosystems sustainably.  Sustainable technologies are rapidly declining in cost and improving, and I believe we will do all of these things. Despite the tough road ahead, I believe that we will prevail, and create a beautiful future as a result.  Don’t lose faith, don’t give up.  Help is on the way, and we will conquer climate change.

I hope you enjoyed the show, and found today’s podcast entertaining and informative.  If you enjoyed the topic of climate change, you’re in for a treat, as the next podcast will dive deep into a company that’s revolutionizing how humanity consumes protein, and saving the planet as a result.  Stay tuned.  We also discussed mostly solar and wind technology solutions, but nuclear is equally if not more promising long-term.  A future podcast will cover innovations in this space and what the future of nuclear power looks like.  Trust me, it’s beyond exciting.

Climatechange,post,agriculture,oz4kec,nnystyxx,Thoughts on the AMOC weakening/collapse scenario + knock-on effects?,"Howdy everybody; I don't often post here, but I came across [this article](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjPg-6loZzyAhXUGs0KHYBsCSgQ0PADegQIBRAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fclimate-environment%2F2021%2F08%2F05%2Fchange-ocean-collapse-atlantic-meridional%2F&usg=AOvVaw3V3u0ncOhXUig7Y_8Z32pz) recently (not to mention comments on it) and I was surprised it hadn't been posted in full yet. I was wondering if some people who are more knowledgeable about things like weather, agriculture etc. could give me more information on what the implications of this would be and how it would affect economics, quality of living, etc. in the affected countries both directly and indirectly.

I typically come to this sub for a break from the doomism in other subs-- people having a very dramatic reaction is not necessarily indicative of how bad something actually is-- so I was wondering, well, just how bad is this possibility and what should I look for + be aware of?

I know that there is not a lot of nuance in saying 'well, this is Very, Very Cataclysmically Bad, but not The End of the World', but I nevertheless am pretty genuinely curious about the real ramifications and whether this is something those countries can meaningfully work around, even if it is quite problematic. It's sent me for quite a spin recently so to either have my fears confirmed or assuaged would be better than turning it over in my head for a long while.",2021-08-06T11:15:08+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,h7xdana,mustyho,,"From what I can gather, the tweet pretty much sums up what we know for sure right now. The report the recent wave of articles reference is [here,](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01097-4) but it’s behind a hard paywall. The next most recent studies published on the AMOC are [here](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070457) and [here.](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/39/eaaz1169) They take into account Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet melting contributing to destabilization of the AMOC, which it seems the IPCC’s AR5 did not. Note that both studies are very clear that what happens to the AMOC depends on emissions scenarios; it has not collapsed and what we do now matters. 

From the Greenland study:
> We find that GrIS melting affects AMOC projections, even though it is of secondary importance. By years 2090–2100, the AMOC weakens by 18% [−3%, −34%; 90% probability] in an intermediate greenhouse-gas mitigation scenario and by 37% [−15%, −65%] under continued high emissions. Afterward, it stabilizes in the former but continues to decline in the latter to −74% [+4%, −100%] by 2290–2300, with a 44% likelihood of an AMOC collapse. This result suggests that an AMOC collapse can be avoided by CO2 mitigation.

From the Antarctic study:
> In both RCP8.5 simulations, an almost complete collapse of the overturning circulation is seen, with the strength of the AMOC decreasing from 24 sverdrup in 2005 to 8 sverdrup by 2250 (Fig. 4A). In RCP8.5FW, the collapse of the overturning circulation (based on the timing when overturning strength drops below 10 sverdrup for 5 consecutive years) is delayed by 35 years, relative to RCP8.5CTRL (Fig. 4A). The largest difference in AMOC in these simulations corresponds to the timing of peak discharge around 2120. The stronger AMOC in RCP8.5FW may be a contributing factor to the higher SST and SAT temperatures in the North Atlantic at this time as compared to RCP8.5CTRL. In RCP4.5FW, the strength of the overturning declines in the beginning of the run and settles into a lower equilibrium of 19 sverdrup, but it does not fully collapse. After 2200, AMOC begins to recover in RCP4.5CTRL but remains suppressed in RCP4.5FW. 

So, no, this isn’t a death knell for us, it’s not triggering the plot to The Day After Tomorrow or whatever else, but this is strange and worrying, given that this kind of destabilization wasn’t expected by this point. I really wish we had answers as to what this means exactly outside of tremendously fucking with weather patterns and upsetting ocean ecosystems, but I don’t think those exist at this point.",2021-08-06T12:17:58+00:00,,,,,,,,,,
Climatechange,comment,agriculture,h7xdezu,NickBloodAU,,"Most of this goes way over my head as a disclaimer. Climate models are way too complex for me to understand, and that's where a lot of this is drawn from. [This article](https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-could-the-atlantic-overturning-circulation-shut-down) covers some of the potential implications of a collapse in a pretty layperson friendly way: 

> **What would be the impacts of a collapse?**

> Climate models can be used to assess the impact on climate if the AMOC were to shut down completely. By adding large amounts of fresh water to the North Atlantic in a model, scientists artificially lighten the cold, dense water that forms the lower branch of the loop. This stops the AMOC and we can then look at the impact on climate.
> 
> The figure below illustrates the changes that result in one such experiment. Shutdown of the AMOC results in a cooling (blue shading) of the whole northern hemisphere, particularly the regions closest to the zone of North Atlantic heat loss (the “radiator” of the North Atlantic central heating system). In these regions the cooling exceeds the projected warming due to greenhouse gases, so a complete shutdown in the 21st century, while very unlikely, could result in a net cooling in regions such as western Europe.

> Other impacts include major shifts in rainfall patterns, increases in winter storms over Europe and a sea level rise of up to 50cm around the North Atlantic basin. In many regions these effects would exacerbate the trends due to global warming.
> 
> While such model experiments are artificial “what if?” scenarios, they illustrate the magnitude of the changes that could result from an AMOC collapse. The impacts on agriculture, wildlife, transport, energy demand and coastal infrastructure would be complex, but we can be certain that there would be major socioeconomic consequences. For example, [one study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-015-2540-2) showed a 50% reduction in grass productivity in major grazing regions of the western UK and Ireland.

That same paper linked just above also talks about reduced water availability, it's worth noting. 

And the linked article I quoted also goes into proactive measures we can consider now, like an early-warning monitoring system that they're researching. Not sure about other measures, but search phrases like ""AMOC collapse adaptation"" will net you articles on it, by the looks of it. Including a fascinating paper titled ""Climate Science Needs to Take Risk Assessment Much More Seriously"" which I just read and fell in love with and will use for my own research so thanks for this thread lol.",2021-08-06T12:19:08+00:00,,,,,,,,,,
Climatechange,comment,agriculture,h7xgyvy,i_didnt_look,,">I really wish we had answers as to what this means exactly outside of tremendously fucking with weather patterns and upsetting ocean ecosystems, but I don’t think those exist at this point.

What it means is that we're in deep shit and all the modeling in the world isn't going to help us. Some models didn't even take this phenomenon into account. This study, like so many others, is screaming how things are devolving faster than anyone or any model predicted. Trying to figure out how long we can play the consumerism game before we absolutely must stop is the most ignorant and hubris filled activity humanity engages in. The answer has been paraded around but no one wants to listen. The  society we live in must end. No more cars, no more vacations to Europe, no more steaks, no more cheap electronics from Asia, it all *must* stop or we're going to die. In some terrible ways as well. Drought, famine, fire, plagues, all the worst of the worst suffering is at our door step and we're still asking *sure, but how long until we suffer* and it's the stupidest thing I have ever seen.

This subreddit has, repeatedly, pushed a ""this is fine"" narrative when confronted with these types of articles, conveying a message that things will be okay, we just need to take small steps to get there. That's not true. We need monumental, leaping bounds to get to zero emmisions. Not net zero, zero. And that involves tremendous suffering from Westerners, and a collapse of the economy, and likely a lot of people dying as a result. It's not pleasant. The alternative is the same thing brought on by climate change and resource scarcity, where instead of choosing the how and when it will be chosen for us.",2021-08-06T12:52:15+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

I also think it's questionable to separate this issue from global warming and say people should focus mostly on the latter because a) they're both highly interrelated and b) already, way more people are focused on climate change than they are risks.

This post I made in another subred addresses some of theses issues.

In it, I point out that when  you have a sufficient number of low-probability possibilities, it becomes a 100% certainty that one of them will occur, and that occurrence changes the probabilities of the other events.

An example is the Canadian heatwave, an extremely low-probability event, triggered wildfires throughout the effected regions, including in some areas where the fire probabilities were low-to-moderate. The heat caused a mass die-off of marine life, another low-probability event, whose ramifications won't be completely felt for years.

The latest report on the AMOC is that it has been destabilizing for more than a century, and could be within 10-30 years of tipping into the weak current version from the strong current that has existed prior to global warming. The consequences of that include more violent weather for northern Europe, and shifting monsoon areas and seasons away from current patterns. That's not an ""if"", it's physics that dictates it *will* occur. The only question where the rains will go.

But no matter where they go, they will fall on areas ill-equipped to take advantage of them, while the places that lose the rain are ill-equipped to deal with constant drought. Shifting agriculture isn't a simple and easy matter of just following the rains. Different temperatures, different soil compositions, different light patterns, different infrastructure resources adds up to a long lag time in adjustment.

The ""doomism"" you are uncomfortable with is probably still too conservative and optimistic for the reality of what is coming in the near future, unfortunately, because most people just can't wrap their minds around the enormity of the problems we face and the enormity of the changes that are happening now, not in some distant future.

That doesn't mean we give up and roll over and die. I'm a combat veteran. You fight even when you know you're chances of death and defeat are high because the alternative is just unthinkable. You fight and live so that those beside you stay alive, and those not in the fight are protected from it. Bad news is that today, no one is not in the fight, we all are, and if we want to stay alive we need all of us to actively engage in that fight.",2021-08-07T19:51:03+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

* FAQ:  [IPCC\_AR6\_WGI\_FAQs](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/faqs/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQs.pdf)

With the release of the AR6 report there will undoubtedly be a flood of commentary covering different aspects and findings in the report. This will be the first, of what I hope to be a series of posts, once every Monday, covering the top-line conclusions of the report, chapter by chapter.

This will not in any way be a comprehensive overview of the AR6 report, if you want that, then just read the SPM or TS! Instead, I simply plan to skim the report and find what sticks out to me as particularly interesting developments. I hope these posts will also serve as places of wider discussion of the much anticipated updated assessment.

\_\_\_

For this first post I want to begin with what most people will probably read, the Summary for Policymakers. Rather than just regurgitating the headline findings I think it would be interesting to see how our knowledge has been updated since the previous AR5 report. So here is a breakdown of the notable improvements and updates in the AR6 SPM compared to the AR5 SPM.

**Greater emphasis placed on ""human influence""**

This is not so much a change in the science as it is a change in the IPCC's presentation. Whereas the dominant role of human influence in causing climate change was previously restricted to the more sterile term ""anthropogenic,"" the AR6 SPM prefers the terms ""human-caused"" and ""human influence."" Throughout the report the role of humanity is emphasized more often, and is quantified with greater confidence, primarily due to the rapid advances in event attribution and climate attribution science over the last decade.

AR6

>It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred.

AR5

>Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased

**Another record breaking decade**

AR6

>Each of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade that preceded it since 1850. Global surface temperature in the first two decades of the 21st century (2001-2020) was 0.99 \[0.84- 1.10\] °C higher than 1850-19009 . Global surface temperature was 1.09 \[0.95 to 1.20\] °C higher in 2011– 2020 than 1850–1900, with larger increases over land (1.59 \[1.34 to 1.83\] °C) than over the ocean (0.88 \[0.68 to 1.01\] °C).

AR5

>Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850 (see Figure SPM.1).

**An updated range of ECS (finally!)**

Roughly speaking, equilibrium climate sensitivity quantifies the global temperature response to the radiative forcing of a doubling of CO2. For decades the likely range of ECS has remained largely unchanged. Unlike AR5, AR6 provides a best estimate for ECS of 3°C.

AR6

>The equilibrium climate sensitivity is an important quantity used to estimate how the climate responds to radiative forcing. Based on multiple lines of evidence, the very likely range of equilibrium climate sensitivity is between 2°C (high confidence) and 5°C (medium confidence). The AR6 assessed best estimate is 3°C with a likely range of 2.5°C to 4°C (high confidence). . .

AR5

>Equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C (high confidence), extremely unlikely less than 1°C (high confidence), and very unlikely greater than 6°C (medium confidence)

**New scenarios, new futures**

AR6:

>Compared to 1850–1900, global surface temperature averaged over 2081–2100 is very likely to be higher by 1.0°C to 1.8°C under the very low GHG emissions scenario considered (SSP1-1.9), by 2.1°C to 3.5°C in the intermediate scenario (SSP2-4.5) and by 3.3°C to 5.7°C under the very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5). **The last time global surface temperature was sustained at or above 2.5°C higher than 1850–1900 was over 3 million years ago (medium confidence).**

AR5:

>Relative to the average from year 1850 to 1900, global surface temperature change by the end of the 21st century is projected to likely exceed 1.5°C for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence). Warming is likely to exceed 2°C for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence), more likely than not to exceed 2°C for RCP4.5 (high confidence), but unlikely to exceed 2°C for RCP2.6 (medium confidence). Warming is unlikely to exceed 4°C for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 (high confidence) and is about as likely as not to exceed 4°C for RCP8.5 (medium confidence). {12.4}

**1.5 and 2°C substantially more likely to be exceeded under SSP/RCP than previous RCPs**

AR6:

>Global warming of 1.5°C relative to 1850-1900 *would be exceeded* during the 21st century under the intermediate, high and very high scenarios considered in this report (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively).

AR5:

>Relative to the average from year 1850 to 1900, global surface temperature change by the end of the 21st century is projected to likely exceed 1.5°C for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence).

AR6:

>Based on the assessment of multiple lines of evidence, global warming of 2°C, relative to 1850– 1900, *would be exceeded* during the 21st century under the high and very high GHG emissions scenarios considered in this report (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively). Global warming of 2°C would *extremely likely* be exceeded in the intermediate scenario (SSP2-4.5).

AR5:

>Warming is *likely* to exceed 2°C for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence), *more likely than not* to exceed 2°C for RCP4.5 (high confidence).

**Improved observational evidence that human-caused climate change is already having impacts**

AR6:

>**Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe.** Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, **their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since AR5.**  
>  
>It is virtually certain that hot extremes (including heatwaves) have become more frequent and more intense across most land regions since the 1950s, while cold extremes (including cold waves) have become less frequent and less severe, with high confidence that human-induced climate change is the main driver14 of these changes. **Some recent hot extremes observed over the past decade would have been extremely unlikely to occur without human influence on the climate system**. Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in frequency since the 1980s (high confidence), and human influence has very likely contributed to most of them since at least 2006.  
>  
>The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most land area for which observational data are sufficient for trend analysis (high confidence), and human-induced climate change is likely the main driver. **Human-induced climate change has contributed to increases in agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions due to increased land evapotranspiration** (medium confidence).  
>  
>It is likely that the global proportion of major (Category 3–5) tropical cyclone occurrence has increased over the last four decades, and the latitude where tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific reach their peak intensity has shifted northward; **these changes cannot be explained by internal variability alone** (medium confidence).  
>  
>Human influence has likely increased the chance of compound extreme events since the 1950s. This includes increases in the **frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts on the global scale (high confidence)**; fire weather in some regions of all inhabited continents (medium confidence); and compound flooding in some locations (medium confidence).

**Human impacts on the cryosphere**

AR6:

>Human influence is very likely the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea ice area between 1979–1988 and 2010–2019 (about 40% in September and about 10% in March). There has been no significant trend in Antarctic sea ice area from 1979 to 2020 due to regionally opposing trends and large internal variability. Human influence very likely contributed to the decrease in Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover since 1950. It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed surface melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet over the past two decades, but there is only limited evidence, with medium agreement, of human influence on the Antarctic Ice Sheet mass loss.

AR5:

>Anthropogenic influences likely contributed to the retreat of glaciers since the 1960s and to the increased surface mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet since 1993. Due to a low level of scientific understanding there is low confidence in attributing the causes of the observed loss of mass from the Antarctic ice sheet over the past two decades. {4.3, 10.5}  
>  
>It is likely that there has been an anthropogenic contribution to observed reductions in Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover since 1970. {10.5}

**Arctic practically sea ice-free September at least once before 2050 under all future scenarios**

AR6:

>Additional warming is projected to further amplify permafrost thawing, and loss of seasonal snow cover, of land ice and of Arctic sea ice (high confidence). The Arctic is likely to be practically sea ice free in September at least once before 2050 under the five illustrative scenarios considered in this report, with more frequent occurrences for higher warming levels. There is low confidence in the projected decrease of Antarctic sea ice.

AR5:

>Based on an assessment of the subset of models that most closely reproduce the climatological mean state and 1979 to 2012 trend of the Arctic sea ice extent, a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in September before mid-century is likely for RCP8.5 (medium confidence) (see Figures SPM.7 and SPM.8). A projection of when the Arctic might become nearly ice-free in September in the 21st century cannot be made with confidence for the other scenarios. {11.3, 12.4, 12.5}

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,h8oiu43,oldladymorris,,"AMOC has already destabilized due to the planet warming.  The question is could it abruptly shut down or will it be gradual, perhaps more minimal if we take action now to keep carbon emissions low.  The ocean is an excellent carbon sink, so it has absorbed a lot of the excess heat and carbon we’ve produced since the Industrial Revolution.  It has caused the ocean to heat up on every level, which is creating havoc amongst marine ecosystems and changing our weather patterns.  Due to unexpected heatwaves in Greenland and the Arctic sea ice, ice sheets and glaciers are melting at unprecedented rates.  Freshwater dilutes the salt, then the mixing at the depths of the ocean, (upwelling) doesn’t occur, and the ocean current slows or shuts down completely.  Since our ocean currents play a HUGE role in our overall climate, yes, an abrupt shutdown or even gradual shutdown, while a low probability event, is cause for concern with how fast the planet is heating up.  Out of all the things we could screw up with the climate, AMOC is by and large one of the worst possibilities in the future.

My opinion is that the SSP 4.5 scenario is most realistic.  

My understanding is that the biggest changes for large continental land masses come from changes in the jet stream. It will become less stable and slower moving.

B1:  Locations that get more than 20"" of rain a year 9/10 years, but less than 35"" a year.  This is an amount that a dry year probably won't mean total crop failure, and a wet year won't wash all our soil to the sea.  Look for low standard deviation from year to year.

B2:  A location that has a good water supply is an alternative.

C:  A location that gets hard winters.  A place where the length of the winter is shorter in our new age won't change nearly as much as one where all the snow has been replaced with rain.

Edit:  A location that has essentially no winter (Occasional hard frosts, and snow that doesn’t stick around is fine) but that has a solid water supply may may also work.

In general, for agriculture you need earth, air, sun, water.  All should be available in reasonable quantities that you can get along with with either an increase or decrease.  

In the American west, water is often the limiting factor.  So drought makes a serious cut to your crops.  In coastal locations water is often not limiting, but can have too much water.  Slopes that allow drainage help.  Coastal regions can have too much rain.  E.g. grain crops need a warm dry period to get ripe, but it’s difficult to harvest them wet.

> Food production on our planet is dominantly based on agricultural practices developed during stable Holocene climatic conditions. Although it is widely accepted that climate change perturbs these conditions, no systematic understanding exists on where and how the major risks for entering unprecedented conditions may occur. Here, we address this gap by introducing the concept of safe climatic space (SCS), which incorporates the decisive climatic factors of agricultural production: precipitation, temperature, and aridity.
>
> **We show that a rapid and unhalted growth of greenhouse gas emissions (SSP5–8.5) could force 31% of the global food crop and 34% of livestock production beyond the SCS by 2081–2100**. The most vulnerable areas are South and Southeast Asia and Africa's Sudano-Sahelian Zone, which have low resilience to cope with these changes. Our results underpin the importance of committing to a low-emissions scenario (SSP1–2.6), whereupon the extent of food production facing unprecedented conditions would be a fraction.

Very relevant maps from that study as well: [here](https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/cms/attachment/75dfe9fd-7db2-4fa3-aae5-297d694f6413/gr6.jpg), [here](https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/cms/attachment/887dae55-b344-47cb-b0e8-3c5e3965c307/fx1.jpg) and [here](https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/cms/attachment/46a2e77d-5d91-4998-a855-ebf3113037fb/gr1.jpg).

It's worth noting that the aforementioned worst-case scenario, [RCP 8.5](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario), is premised on the idea that the emissions will accelerate for [every remaining year](https://static.skepticalscience.com/pics/ghg-concentrations.PNG) in this century. It assumes that oil usage would not peak [until 2075](https://static.skepticalscience.com/pics/energy-oil.PNG) to enable such emissions  (some scientists consider this so unlikely that [one study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41247-016-0013-9) has given RCP 8.5 a 12% chance of occurring, with 42% for the next-highest one, RCP 6), as the result of the remaining developing countries using them to industrialize so rapidly that [the global economy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378016300711) becomes 15 times larger by 2100 then it was in 2010. 

In general, the world [is believed](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/) to trend closer to the ""intermediate"" scenarios in the long run. Having said that, the current models focus on overall trends but lack the computing power to process isolated extreme events like the recent European floods (though here's [a recently-published study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL092361) trying to do better at predicting floods), so at least until the modellers receive CERN-scale supercomputers they have been asking for, studies like the above are not going to be the final word.",2021-08-19T16:09:07+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Climatechange,post,agriculture,pihobw,saywhaa_sayyeah,Go Gang Green!!!,"Climate change/global warming is undoubtedly real. Anyone thinking otherwise probably still leaves cookies out for Santa, or just hasn't ever thought about it and possess a futile IQ. 
We have reasons to believe there was an ice age....so obviously there's been a trend of warming since then. So those who deny the planet is on a warming trend should probably have there tongues and fingers removed to prevent them from sharing any info about anything. 
The natural warming occurrence of the planet has obviously been given a steroidal injection by means of human activity. I believe that should be pretty fn obvious. Im not a researcher or scientist with a lifetime dedicated to finding a cure, so like most people, I'm pretty ignorant. But unlike most, I'm able to admit that. 
Tbh, idk if I'm more terrified by the ""woke"" or ""unwoke"" population. 
Its hard to place blame on the ""unwoke"" older generation of people. All of the blame belongs to some of those fuckers but for the most part I can't blame the majority. I don't care if they still think climate change is fake, Oswald shot JFK, and man has walked on the moon. Its not their fault, they lived an entirely different existence. I've always questioned everything so its hard not to judge them for believing everything they were told, but thats how they were trained from infancy. Do what your parents say. Unfortunately, everyone was brainwashed from the top of society and had no real opportunity to escape that facade. So they've lived a life of being mislead. Sure they could become awaken in today's world and for younger people its easy to say they should. I can say with almost total certainty that when I'm 70-80, (old af), I will have 0 desire to change a lifetime of beliefs while I coast out the rest of my days. Again, its easy for present day me to say old me is an inconsiderate p.o.s., but old me is worn out and very likely tired of things changing. Aside from a few, most everyone I knew is dead, the places I made cherished memories are gone and replaced with concrete and stores. I would find it very hard to put energy towards developing a new way of thinking while I hang on to happy memories that happened under different planetary/societal circumstances. Totalitarian blame deserves to go to prior generations. Ima guess that very few/none of us has ever conversed with those deserving of the blame. 
So next time you talk to someone that is obviously not living in reality, don't get pissed at them and judge the entire slew for what they believe. Personally, I just make an internal note of sympathy on their behalf and go on my way. I don't debate with or try to change what they think. Mainly because I don't waste time and energy on shit void of benefits and also I like the idea of letting people die happy with their beliefs. I can't imagine too many things worse than approaching the light at the end of the tunnel with some serious internal conflicts going on.
My empathy and sympathy pertains to 99% of them that aren't really at fault in the first place and can't really help with improvements anyways. Instead of fighting with and trying to change the 1% able of making change, they just need to be removed from their positions. How? Idk, but energy would be better spent on removal than transitioning them.

Actually, I guess I do know who I find more terrifying. Its not the diminishing group that got put us in this position. Their damage is already done for the most part. 
I am a bit scared of the wokes, though. I love people having the mindset of making things better and conscious of the planet's wellbeing. I like it, (I like it a loht). I like people wanting to become more aware and knowledgeable. I don't like how people think they are better than others just because they have interpreted information they believe is 100% factual. 
Pretty much the only guaranteed fact that exists is that we ultimately don't know shit. We may have evidence suggesting its factual, but how do we know we have all of the evidence? How do we know the evidence has been interpreted correctly? Even if it was, was it correctly/truthfully communicated by those in the know? 
As hard as it is for me to imagine past people just believing what they were told even though they had very little information  accessible to them. Its harder to believe that today people can be so certain about something they read somewhere. I mean I get the psychological reasons, its easy to get on board with something that aligns with what we believe and vice versa. I just feel we as a species should be past those by now. The simple fact that there is probably a completely contradictory side to whatever it is should make people at least stop and think like, hey maybe there is a 1% chance its not how I think, instead of just disregarding the fake news. There's at least 3 sides to every story and that only gets vastly multiplied on the internet. So how are people able to be so certain? 

I'm pretty positive humans are fucking up the planet. I am about as sold on that  as i can get. I'm just not necessarily sold on the reasons that people with hidden agendas say. I'm not suggesting their claims of pollution and emissions are bogus. That shit seems pretty obvious. I don't need to read an intellects article to ""inform"" me. What happens when you sit in a running vehicle in a closed garage? Lightheaded, nasuea, and eventual death. Right? Why would anyone think the world isn't a much, much larger garage? Exactly, so combustion engines are killing us, should be obvious. Many of the things that are supposedly killing the planet seem pretty obvious. You won't find me saying any of it is good and isn't getting momma earth all hot and bothered. 
I graduated from college with a BS, but common sense is far more educational than any university course. It may not produce an expert in any one field, but it does provide knowledge that is widely applicable. It serves as my base information source on most topics and is responsible for the a lot of my actions and beliefs. 
Maybe I'm just a dumb/ignorant farmer that grew up and spent most of my time in the middle of nowhere. Honestly, I was quite shocked when I heard the news that I'm apparently one of the main reasons causing the impending doom. If it weren't for motivatimed agendas I would have never been aware of the devastating consequences of my daily actions. 
I've always been fascinated by and appreciative of the big momma E. Most notably the ground where things grow and the air I breathe. Even as a tike, I was conscious of what humans were doing to her. I would compare the present day way of living and the affects to the wild west days of horses buggies. I wasn't really aware of the magnitude of destruction or anything but I just felt it wasn't as pure of an existence we are living. So anytime I think about the impact of humans, I compare present day with the pre industrial days.
I still have a lot of room for more wokeness to learn how I can quit contributing to killing all of us. But as I await the opening of my eyes I can't help but view things through common sense lenses. 
Im not delusional and believe that farming doesn't have negative environmental effects. I mean, I literally can't think of anything that doesn't for fuck sakes haha. I guess my astonishment upon hearing the news that I'm a horrible being came from the fact that I've never became nauseous or suffered a headache from breathing the air on a farm. My eyes haven't burnt from the hazey cloud hanging around. With wide open Montana being a possible exception, idk if there's a more rural area than where I live. Its literally agriculture for hundreds of miles in every direction before there is any type of substantial mass of people and pavement. If there was an area where the immediate effects of farming were felt, id be in it. So forgive my dumbfoundedness. Anytime I go to a metro area for a few days I can't wait to get back so I can breathe good air again. I realize the detriment can extend beyond the immediate area, but to claim the emissions from farm machinery is a huge problem is beyond ignorant to just fucking stupid. Maybe 40-50 years ago when there were 10 tractors pumping out the black smoke in every field. I'm sure there's an industrial park in one city that produces what all tractors collectively emit. 

Common sense also suggests something I have never seen or heard anyone mention a contributing factor to the world heating up. I've seen the studies showing the correlation of hotter temps and cars over the last 100 yrs. I'm not saying cars don't emit naughty gas. But why doesn't anyone take it a step further? Have you ever seen or heard about the tire problems of 100 yrs ago? I don't guess i really have either. I'm not an expert, but if i had to guess, I'd say they did indeed have tire issues. It wouldn't have been from all the kids uglying up all the streets by burning their tires and leaving black marks everywhere. It would've been from the shitty/rocky/unpaved roads they drove on. If one was to consider every highway, road, and street that is paved, they would realized quite a bit of earth is underneath. Don't forget about everything like parking lots, runways, steel buildings ect. It may not seem like much on the grand scale of things. But you're fucking higher than I've ever been if you don't think the sun beaming off of all of that heat-retaining concrete, asphalt, ect hasnt made things a tad warmer. When I compare today to the way back days, I can't help but feel pretty confident in thinking that the accumulated effect of today's landscape wouldn't play a significant role in the accelerated temperature rise. 
It also probably doesn't help that watering restrictions are causing people to add more rock and artificial turf to their yards. When I was doing landscaping up by the city the grass to not grass ratio was crazy to me. I grew up on a dirt road without any pavement for 8 miles. So going to these ""country houses"" <- was funny to me. First off, I could probably throw a baseball from one spot and hit 30 houses and there were hundreds more lined up past those. Each one had a very small patch of grass in front and one in back maybe twice the size. Nearly everyone had some type of rockscape that equaled the front grass. With a paved street, sidewalks, driveways,  and the house itself I'd guess that maybe 5-10% of land in a neighborhood had living grass or plants. And that's the earthy part of cities aside from a park here and there. Which are completely surrounded by heat-retaining earth-covering materials. 

But i guess educated persons don't see it the same as I do. There will be more natural earth smothered for human luxury next year and the years following.  While experts and wannabe sperts ignore the obviousness of it and direct their blame elsewhere. 

Writing this might have convinced me that this is far more detrimental than just a small factor like I originally believed. Maybe I have too much respect for BIG Momma E and her powers but something tells me she is capable of fixing herself. Im sure its more likely that she would be able to fix herself in terms of the greenhouses gases that originated from within her in the first place. Maybe were putting them out at a rate she can't contend with, maybe she can adapt a quicker method. I think in time she could also overcome the concrete blanket she's getting but not at the rate we keep knitting additional pieces. There's just no fn way she can conjure up that kind of healing power to compete at this pace. 

Maybe I'm way wrong, maybe I'm just defensive and not easily accepting of the never-ending attacks on ag, so I'm fabricating the first alternatives I can think of. I'm not accusing anyone of anything, I believe that as conscious individuals most people are good. At least in their core. Seemingly all to often it can get masked by their greed and ego. 
Genuine planetary concern is becoming more and more prominent and that's a great thing. I just hope everyone can check their hiprocracy at the door and refrain from making attacks towards others without really knowing the reasons for such attacks. 

What would an alien, with no previous knowledge or bias, perceive as being more environmentally toxic if they were to spend a week on a farm and a week in the city? 

I believe there's pretty much only one solution for legitimately reduce the wounds of the ass kicking we've been giving BIG Momma E.    (Aside from a mass depopulation, which wouldn't actually be a solution as much as it would just prolong the consequences of our behavior). 
There are other potential solutions that may come to fruition in the future. But as of today, there's only one solution that I can see for true change to actually happen. Though it'll never happen, not until its far too late and it simply has to happen. 
If every human was a vegan and every vehicle was electric, would the world be saved? I'm pretty sure the answer is no. The destruction might get delayed, but no one knows what the consequences of today's actions will be in fifty years. Unless we find/build something that can make everything us humans need out of thin air, our attempts will be moot. 
Any green movement or vegan agenda won't matter without an extreme societal    change in civilization. But like Ive already said,  that will never happen.  
This is already wayyyyy longer than intended so I'll save my solution for those that are interested. Cause lordy knows this one is long enough, haha. 

Go team BIG Momma E!!!!!


PS: My other initial thought is: Do volcanos that are making new islands in the ocean not have an impact on the water level? Its all just due to the ice caps melting? I mean I did see a guy with some schmancy title before his name say that. He was wearing a suit too so I wanted to believe him. But what he said was the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard a supposedly educated person publicly say. It was something to the tune of ""melting ice caps are causing the sea levels to rise. Just like a full glass of ice water would overflow when the ice melted."" 👉----🤯🩸🩸🩸   🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

 See these values from the Supporting Materials of [the widely reported ""Hothouse Earth"" study](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/33/8252) for how much global warming from major feedback loops like those would be seen between hitting 2 C and 2100.
 
https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2018/07/31/1810141115.DCSupplemental/pnas.1810141115.sapp.pdf

Feedback | Strength of feedback| Speed of Earth System response 
:--| :--:| :--
Permafrost | 0.09 (0.04-0.16)°C; | by 2100
Methane hydrates |Negligible by 2100| Gradual, slow release of C on millennial time scales to give +0.4 - 0.5 C
Weakening of land and ocean carbon sinks | Relative weakening of sinks by 0.25(0.13-0.37) °C | by 2100
Increased bacterial respiration in the ocean | 0.02 C | by 2100
Amazon forest dieback | 0.05 (0.03-0.11) °C | by 2100
Boreal forest dieback | 0.06(0.02-0.10) °C | by 2100

Likewise, a [study](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/18/4937/2021/) published just last week is in line with that, estimating that if net zero is reached after we emit another 1000 billion tons of carbon, then the warming from permafrost would be about 0.06 C in 50 years, 0.09 C in 100 years, and 0.27 C in 500 years.

As for methane hydrates, it's been known for the past few years the methane from there barely leaves the water in the first place, which is why that feedback is considered incapable of any notable warming on ""short"" timescales.

> The gas discharge occurs in water depths at and shallower than the upper edge of the gas hydrate stability zone and generates a dissolved methane plume that is hundreds of kilometer in length. Data collected in the summer of 2015 revealed that 0.02–7.7% of the dissolved methane was aerobically oxidized by microbes **and a minor fraction (0.07%) was transferred to the atmosphere during periods of low wind speeds**. Most flares were detected in the vicinity of the Hornsund Fracture Zone, leading us to postulate that the gas ascends along this fracture zone. The methane discharges on bathymetric highs characterized by sonic hard grounds, whereas glaciomarine and Holocene sediments in the troughs apparently limit seepage. The large scale seepage reported here is not caused by anthropogenic warming.

> In response to warming climate, methane can be released to Arctic Ocean sediment and waters from thawing subsea permafrost and decomposing methane hydrates. However, it is unknown whether methane derived from this sediment storehouse of frozen ancient carbon reaches the atmosphere. We quantified the fraction of methane derived from ancient sources in shelf waters of the U.S. Beaufort Sea, a region that has both permafrost and methane hydrates and is experiencing significant warming.
>
> Although the radiocarbon-methane analyses indicate that ancient carbon is being mobilized and emitted as methane into shelf bottom waters, surprisingly, we find that methane in surface waters is principally derived from modern-aged carbon. **We report that at and beyond approximately the 30-m isobath, ancient sources that dominate in deep waters contribute, at most, 10 ± 3% of the surface water methane**. These results suggest that even if there is a heightened liberation of ancient carbon–sourced methane as climate change proceeds, oceanic oxidation and dispersion processes can strongly limit its emission to the atmosphere.",2021-09-18T21:15:16+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

 If your rivers are fed by snowpack, and the snowpack vanishes, your flow will change more from spring to fall.  Groundwater is replenished by rainfall, or you are mining it.  If your average rainfall drops by 20% then the amount of water you can extract drops too.

There have been recorded cases of ""well wars""  when too many people tried to extract water.  So you dig a new well 100 feet deeper than your neighbours.  You do fine, until 6 out of 10 of your neighbours do the same thing.

Climate change is already having an impact on the farming business, which is a big part of the US economy, with unpredictable weather and increased drought and flooding. The United Arab Emirates, which has proposed to host climate talks in 2023, has reaped the benefits of its oil revenues while simultaneously developing technologies to increase agricultural harvests in its partly arid terrain.

At the United Nations, the two countries announced the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate). Climate change meetings are taking place in Glasgow, Scotland, and are viewed as crucial to avoiding the worst effects of climate change. ""The climate catastrophe threatens to destabilize agricultural systems around the world, worsen food insecurity, and significantly harm farmers' livelihoods,"" said US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who also called for investment to assist the industry adapt. AIM has received support from more than 30 countries and 40 non-governmental organizations so far.

Climatechange,post,agriculture,r0d95z,MartiAlBa,Should I give up my Pet to reduce emissions?,"I’ve been feeling guilty. In 2017 Forbes magazine published that ""Dogs and cats are responsible for a quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions caused by animal agriculture…which adds up to a whopping 64 million tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent emitted in the production of their food.”
Further, the importance of pets in the US has increased since 2017. Expenditures in pet-related industries increased from 90bn dollars in 2017 to 109bn dollars in 2020. That is a “whopping” 21 percent increase. If we use the expenditure growth to guesstimate the amount of emissions from pet food, we obtain that the 64 million tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions have become 77.44 million tons. This sounds large. 

However, compared to the total emissions of the US alone it seems very small. In 2020 US emissions were 6,558 million tons.
So pets would just account for 1.1 percent. It seems then that getting rid of all pets would not really be a significant step toward netzero.
Keeping people at home and getting them used to walking around instead of driving may be a more important role of pets in the world of carbon emissions.  No more coal pls.",2021-11-23T13:29:02+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Oh and tornados, lots of tornados. If you wanted a climate like today's Kansas you would have to move to Canada, and the freshly melted tundra. 

Canada and russia will be on the brink of war over control of shipping routes over the arctic, which will be ice free. I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't a political movement to build much closer ties with the US - Canada will need weapons, the US needs cooler lands to migrate to. (President Bieber is unlikely however).

Sea level will have risen by about 11 inches. That will increase the effects of winter storms on vulnerable coastal areas, so there will substantial erosion in Florida and other river deltas. Governments wil have had to spend considerable on increasing flood defences around cities in low lying areas. The US national debt will thus be even larger - but as long as it has the most powerful armed forces no one's going to come knocking to collect.

The natural world will have pretty much disappeared - some species will survive in zoos so technically won't have gone extinct (there are more tigers in cages in Texas than there are in the wild). Since half the world's population will have grown up after the collapse, they won't particularly notice, they will just think of butterflies as being as mythical as unicorns, and eagles as the same as dragons. (And since so much of the population will spend most of their time in on-line virtual worlds, they will see as many dragons as eagles)

By now people will mostly be eating some sort of artificial vat-grown product as basic sustenance, with traditional agriculture reserved for delicacies for the elite. But there will be enough of it, if you have the money. For everyone else - well, there's everyone else - big lumps of protein on legs.

But the US will still be one of the richest countries in the world, so climate change will impact far less than elsewhere in the world. Drought can be tackled with desalination, oil can be turned into food using genetically engineered fungi, and solar power can cool homes. The richer you are the less climate change will impact your life. The poor will face severe hardships, and average lifespan for the poorest 10% in the US will likely be around 50.

Africa and South America will be mostly conflict and failed states, Russia and China will be totalitarian again, and Europe will be slaughtering millions of migrants on its borders, with its governments mostly right-wing nationalists with a ""racial purity"" agenda and a tendency towards armbands.

That is really, really, really optimistic. While it is true that the rate of population growth is slowing, as a result of dropping birthrates worldwide, basically every population growth model I have come across has the population of the world peak at around 2100 with 10-11 billion people in the world.  Further, in the short term, even cutting global fertility rates to 2.1 isn't going to do much to slow population growth as it would take a few decades for death rates to catch up to an aging population.  The current global fertility rate is still well above the replacement rate, even if it is dropping. 

To get population growth to stagnate in a decade, you would have to either raise the death rate to match births, or drop the global birthrate down enough that it matches the death rate.

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,hob2ero,kearsargeII,,"My understanding of volcanic eruptions is that they don't actually change the global climate much in the long term. Volcanic cooling is a result of the input of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, which reflects solar energy back into space. Sulfur dioxide does not stay in the atmosphere for very long, and a big volcano releases it all in a single massive burst. A supervolcano eruption would drop temperatures severely for a few years, probably screwing over agriculture worldwide and causing mass starvation, but after that, temperatures return to what they were before the eruption. Maybe, if you timed one at the exact right time, you could screw with the Atlantic Meridonal Overturning Current enough that it kicks off an ice albedo feedback loop and we go into a longer ice age, but I am pretty sure that is unlikely given where we are in the milankovitch cyces.

I think that large scale trap eruptions can have a more permenant effect on the global climate, given that they are basically continually releasing immense amounts of both carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide over the course of thousands of years, but to my knowledge, the last big one was 65 million years ago, and its climate signal cannot really be seperated from the other event that happened at the exact same time.  The Siberian Traps of the late Permian, at very least, are by far the most likely cause of the Great Dying, even if the effect of the Deccan Traps is impossible to seperate from the massive asteroid impact that occured at the exact same time.

That all being said, the whole sulfur dioxide connection with volcanic eruptions was not discovered until the 1990s. The effect of greenhouse gasses has been known for far longer, and functions on the same basic energy principles.",2021-12-12T22:52:21+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

>> Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress.

This might sound bad, but for a population of 8B+, 250K is negligible amount. In that case, are we suggesting that we could continue living the way we do today(using fossil fuels, cutting down rainforests, dumping plastics in ocean, etc) and still most people will manage to live? For all the collapsing ice sheets, bees going extinct, water getting polluted and agricultural production dropping, just 250K more deaths per year?

Let's think of the worst case scenario where politicians keep kicking the can down the road. Temperatures keep rising and species keep going extinct. Rainfall becomes unpredictable and disasters become more common. By 2050, or 2100, or 2200, are we not going to reach a point where 5B people are starving to death? All that harm to nature doesn't affect humanity(much)?

In that case, the only reasons to worry about climate change seems to be higher cost of living, lack of natural wonders to look at for our children and a teeny tiny chance of dying because of it. While that's bad, it doesn't seem like the biggest issue that I would face in my lifetime at all. Worrying about degrading democratic rights, or getting hit by a bus seems to be a better choice.

Similarly, how likely are wet bulb temperatures in a specific city by 2030? Can we estimate deaths due to such a event based on their poverty levels?

Climatechange,post,agriculture,sy3z6o,listtowardslight,Why fighting climate change has to be a many-pronged effort.,"Rather than debate one single approach to combating the climate crisis vs. another, it's important to take a big-picture approach.  If you haven't read [Project Drawdown](https://drawdown.org/drawdown-framework), do so!

In that spirit, I want to volunteer what I see as indispensable planks for a livable, regenerative future.  We need to regenerate ecosystems to be healthy carbon sinks.  This has to be from the foundations of the food web on up, from soil microbes and algae on up.


* Bio-active soil amendments, like Amazonian [Terra Preta](http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/research/terra%20preta/terrapretamain.html) and other biochar soil amendments around the world.  These consist of charred biomass and compost, inoculated with nutrients microbes that establish and propogate themselves.  Terra Preta has been known to grow a centimeter a year in the Amazon, absorbing carbon and sequestering it in its mass while building fertility.


* Closed-loop algae farms.  This is one of the easiest things to [do at home](https://www.wikihow.com/Grow-Spirulina-at-Home), and if you get it right, your most low-footprint [food source](https://wiki.lowtechlab.org/wiki/Culture_de_la_spiruline/en).  It will improve your air quality, regardless.  And yes, it does [scale up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAdrNQNP8ew) to industrial levels.  Its value as a carbon sink and potential fertilizer for crops is not to be ignored.


* [Accelerated forest regeneration](https://www.wri.org/insights/what-assisted-natural-regeneration-benefits-definition).  By mimicking and aiding the phases of growth of natural forests from ponds and meadows to early growth to maturity, we can get bio-diverse forests back in a fraction of the time that would be naturally required.


* Fixing [glitches in photosynthesis](https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-boost-plant-production-by-40-percent-through-a-photosynthesis-shortcut).  Many of the plants adapted to arid conditions, as well as some of the fastest-growing trees, use C4 photosynthesis.  This is an alternative to C3 photosynthesis, which most lush greenery uses.  Turns out, C4 photosynthesis [can be engineered in staple grains](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201112100856.htm), and C3 photosynthesis can catch up.


* Bacteria as a source of protein-rich food staples - [bacilliculture instead of agriculture](https://thebulletin.org/2022/02/would-you-eat-bacteria-to-help-reverse-climate-change/).


* Remodel our existing buildings to use more [passive energy](https://www.motherearthnews.com/green-homes/how-to-remodel-a-passive-solar-home-zb0z1305zhla) instead of actively heating and cooling forced air.


* Use better building materials.  Eight percent of our total emissions comes from producing portland cement.  Alternatives include solar-thermal kilns for [steel and cement](https://grist.org/article/this-company-wants-to-make-steel-and-cement-with-solar-power-heres-how/), [insulated rammed earth](https://sirewall.com/sirewall-system/), earthbags AKA [superadobe](http://www.earthbagbuilding.com/articles/bagmachine.htm), and natural materials like [cob](https://brightly.eco/cob-houses/).

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,hxw558t,LyraSerpentine,,"If we make our cities and our houses sustainable and self-reliant, most of our cultural issues contributing to the climate crisis will dissolve. 

Think about it. If we can house every person on this planet, if that house creates and stores its own energy/water/sewage/etc. (circular systems), and if that house can grow its own food forest, then we've won half the battle. A community of these houses would need to be walkable (not focused on vehicles), sustainable (with zero carbon footprint), and would require to serve as carbon sinks (green roofs, for example). This would decrease carbon tremendously in the sense that people are growing their own food (less plastic packaging, less fossil fuels for transportation), they aren't driving as much (we could install a hyperloop to connect these communities to other areas, too), and, not only are the structures sustainable, but the buildings are carbon sinks (removing and storing carbon from the atmosphere is going to be vital moving forward).

And this is just focusing on sustainable structures, city planning, agricultural methods, renewable energies, and transportation. After that, we should obviously focus on industry, greening jobs and offices, removing forever chemicals and plastics from our environment, and recycling. I live in the States and I'm astonished at how little we recycle here simply because we don't have the infrastructure to do it properly. It's shameful. As we progress down this path of deep adaptation, we should also be moving away from capitalism and economic systems based on growth and exploitation, and we should be progressing toward circular systems based on recycling and maintaining what we have.

If we want to adapt to the climate crisis, then we're going to need to start making cultural and economic changes - radical changes - with or without governments and corporations, and we need to do it soon. Otherwise, we'll be in deep trouble.

My suggestion is that if enough of us get together, we can select a temperate zone, build this sustainable, self-reliant community (that makes our current way of life obsolete without compromising our quality of life), and let the world follow our example. There are many variables to climate change, but ensuring that our species survives is the first step.",2022-02-21T22:56:42+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,hxwk68x,listtowardslight,,"Finite capacity for population is real, but we're far from it being the top problem.  The world can support 7.9 billion people.  It can't support 7.9 western industrial lifestyles.

Most of the problem is linear use of resources - mining, to manufacture, to global transport, to use, to pollution.  That is out of place in a cyclic ecosystem.

One of the reasons I brought up Terra Preta is that the research at Cornell University and elsewhere points to its role in pre-Columbian agro-forestry in the Amazon.  Early European explorers reported highly populated ""cities"", a thing that was laughed off since jungles can't support such a thing.  Or so they thought.  

The pre-Columbian natives charred wood, food waste, and compost in covered smoldering piles - a process called pyrolysis - and created dark, rich soil unlike anything natural to a rain forest.  Their form of horticulture resembled what we call food forests today, a cultivated mixture of trees, shrubs, and vines growing similarly to a wild forest but with human-selected and propagated cultivars.  It was a win-win for the rainforest and for humans.  These cultures actually helped to spread the Amazon rainforest further, a direct opposite of ""drought follows the plow"" agriculture that arose in the Middle East.

I'm not suggesting that we must directly copy these ancient cultures, but there is much inspiration to draw from them, to combine with what we know now.

Point is, population reduction deflects from the real issue.  Humans are fully capable of being a net-positive to this planet, not a negative.  We can do that if we deeply re-orient our societal constructs.

Climatechange,post,agriculture,uyx9ir,iboughtarock,"Climate change facts, solutions, and additional resources.","# Facts:

* Daily we emit 117 million tons of CO2. Global CO2 emissions are 43 billion tons each year. [\[S\]](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
* As CO2 concentrations build in the atmosphere, infrared light radiated from earth's surface is absorbed by the CO2. Thus trapping heat in earth's atmosphere. This is known as the greenhouse effect. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect)
* 38% of global CO2 emissions have dissolved in the oceans. When CO2 dissolves in water it forms carbonic acid. This is known as ocean acidification. [\[S\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub) [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_storage_of_carbon_dioxide) [\[S\]](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/outstand/feel2633/feel2633.shtml)
* The ocean has 50 times more CO2 than the atmosphere. The ocean has 39,000 billion tons of CO2. The atmosphere has 750 billion tons of CO2. [\[S\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub)
* As the ocean becomes more acidic, less CO2 is able to be stored in the water. This leads to CO2 being released from the ocean and sent to the atmosphere. The same goes for ocean temperature. As water temperature rises, less CO2 is able to stay dissolved (e.g. leave a carbonated drink out on a warm day). [\[S\]](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016RG000533)
* As temperatures rise, soil begins to increase the release of carbon in a process known as soil respiration. Researchers estimate soil carbon loss over the 21st century will be equivalent to two decades of carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. [\[S\]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan2874)

# Solutions:

* **Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE):** Use mafic and ultramafic rocks (olivine, peridotite, etc.) to bind to CO2 and form carbonates. Thus converting CO2 into an alkaline carbonate mineral. These carbonates could then be placed in the ocean to raise the pH and bring it back to normal levels, and increase CO2 storage capacity in the ocean. [\[S\]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c08561) [\[S\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2019.00007/full)
* **Direct air capture (DAC):** Use large fans to concentrate CO2 into a chamber and then absorb the CO2 by various means. The CO2 can be converted into a long term storage medium such as a carbonate or left as vapor CO2. In the case of vapor CO2 there is some commercial value or it can be pumped into geological wells for storage. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_air_capture)
* **Renewable energy:** Wind, solar, geothermal, wave/tidal/marine power, etc. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy)
* **Cultured meats:** Growing meat from cell cultures instead of factory farming. This would free up billions of acres globally, democratize access to protein sources, and eliminate CO2 and CH4 emissions associated with factory farming. In the United States 41% of land use goes towards grazing and animal feed crops. These areas of land are usually high in sunlight and could be used for solar, wind, afforestation, or DAC.

* **Reducing fossil fuel emissions:** This can be done by scrubbing some of the CO2 from the source before emitting it to the atmosphere. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber)
* **Afforestation:** Afforestation is the establishment of a forest in an area where there was no previous tree cover. Tree-planting campaigns are sometimes criticized for targeting areas where forests would not naturally occur, such as grassland and savanna biomes. Afforestation can negatively affect ecosystems through increasing fragmentation, edge effects, and making the surface albedo darker (especially in northern regions).

Climatechange,post,agriculture,vohv8w,Bioecoevology,A climate thought experiment.,"For the sake of a thought experiment, let's all assume that the science of climate change (e.g., climatology) is generally correct. So, even if you don't believe that yourself, just temporary assume it (e.g., imagine or ""suspend belief"" ) for the sake of this thought experiment. In other words, this post is more of a philosophical discussion within the context of what we can do to mitigate the increase in average global heating (that causes climate change), assuming the science is generally correct. So, even if you consider yourself a climate sceptic (or you know someone that does), you do have the imagination to ""make-believe"" the alternative view.

In our little thought experiment, billions of people are not aware of the science. Maybe they are misinformed about that science or are motivated due to monetary or lifestyle reasons (e.g., business), to believe in an alternative view. And disinform others about that science (e.g., greenwash).

Therefore, logically we can deduce that these billions of people will not be motivated to not do something that they do not consider a problem. In other words, they will not be motivated to not burn Carbon-based fuels even if they could (e.g., of carbon-based fuels: coal \[""fossil"" fuel\], gas, and crude oil derivatives such as diesel and petrol (& biofuels. e.g., wood or oils derived from other types of plants). In fact, proximately, billions of people perceive that burning these fuels (i.e., to fuel their machines), is a solution (e.g., to travel or ""get the job done"").

So, we have established in this thought experiment two concepts.

1. That many people are not sufficiently aware of the relevant science (e.g., due to ignorance, being greenwashed or biased)
2. That many people will continue to be sold, buy and burn (or use machines that burn) carbon-based fuels.

Also, in our thought experiment, we have assumed that the relevant science is generally correct. For example, the general narrative is that some people in our societies say that the science says climate change is real and some people say it's not. Those that say it's real also say that its greenhouse gas emissions (& land degradation. e.g., deforestation) that are causing the biosphere (air, water and land) to heat up (On average. i.e.,  ""overall"". And it's that extra heat that is causing the climate to change).

The purpose of this thought experiment is not to debate who is right or wrong, it's to assume, for the sake of a thought experiment, that burning carbon-based fuels (Carbon dioxide and Methane emissions) and animal agriculture (Methane and Carbon dioxide emissions) are the leading cause of greenhouse gas emission which are heating up the Planet's biosphere (& ocean acidification within the context of Carbon Dioxide).

Therefore,

3. The Planet's biosphere is going to continue to heat up (on average). And heat drives the Planet's weather systems (amongst other variables such as water). Which over time is termed ""human-caused climate change"" (in contrast to non-human caused climate change. e.g., solar radiation from the sun)

So,  there are no signs that humans are going to stop burning more carbon-based fuels any time soon. For example,  Carbon dioxide targets keep getting ""missed"". Greenhouse gas emissions increase rather than decrease. Politicians and industries keep signing on the ""extract more oil"" contracts or ""dig up more coal"" contracts or have more agricultural animals ""burping methane"" contracts.

So, there are no limits in our economic system that is preventing humanity from continuously heating up the planet's biosphere. And, as already discussed, the system is actually designed to encourage humans to burn more fuels, not less.

The next logical question is ""is increasingly heating up the Planet's biosphere bad?"".

Will it be ""bad"" if the ice (snow, etc) melts in the polar regions? Will that be ""bad"" for those billions of people that live near the coast (the sea)?  will it be ""bad"" for those billions of people (and non-human animals, plants and fungi), that live in regions close to the equator? (i.e., countries where it can already get very hot at certain times of the year)

Or will climate heating have some good effects? Maybe it will prevent the coming of the next (big) ice age? Maybe a little bit of climate heating isn't all ""bad"" news? But maybe too much will tip our civilisations over the ""edge"".

However, the established science (that we are assuming is correct), generally says that climate heating is a ""bad"" idea (not that we explicitly planned it. i.e., greenhouse gases are a byproduct of the activities we do. e.g., some like the ""meat"", and are not thinking about the methane emissions that the agricultural animals produce).

Therefore, assuming that human-caused climate heating is a ""bad"" idea, the next logical question is can we choose to prevent it? And if so, what is causing us to not prevent it? Is it impossible to not eat farmed meat? Is it impossible to not turn forests into wood fuel tree plantations?

Or is it simply impossible for many humans to actually want to really do something themselves to prevent climate heating?

Please keep all replies within the scope of this thought experiment. So that, for example, we are not denying that billions of humans burning fuels is causing climate heating.",2022-06-30T20:20:18+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Clearly, your first concept is wrong - or at least much less correct than you assumed.

> So, there are no signs that humans are going to stop burning more carbon-based fuels any time soon.

Which is why even the most optimistic climate goal on a global scale is net zero *by 2050* - and which looks extremely unlikely to be met. The more realistic yet still unlikely goal is global net zero *by 2070*. A typical study on the impact of climate change tends to compare the scenario where that second goal is achieved (known as RCP 2.6) with the scenario where the emissions [keep increasing for the rest of the century](https://static.skepticalscience.com/pics/ghg-concentrations.PNG) - known as RCP 8.5 The more grounded studies replace one of those with RCP 4.5, where the global emissions increase for another decade or so, and do not start to meaningfully go down until mid-century.

> So, there are no limits in our economic system that is preventing humanity from continuously heating up the planet's biosphere.

Climatechange,post,agriculture,w1lbkn,No_Glove2682,QUESTION REGARDING NITROGEN POLICIES IN THE NETHERLANDS,"The Dutch government is trying to combat the nitrogen problem by halving the livestock. While I am of course fully in favor of policies on combating climate change and promoting biodiversity, this policy nevertheless raised two essential questions for me.

Although nitrogen can be seen as a relatively local problem, 30-40% of nitrogen comes from abroad. The Netherlands itself has a lot of policy on nitrogen that farmers must adhere to. Significant progress has therefore been made in this area. Many other countries do not have this policy. The Netherlands also exports a lot to countries that would emit much more if they produced it themselves. When the livestock is halved; however, the demand for these goods will not decrease and the supply will shift. If this happens in countries where there are few or no measures regarding the responsible use of nitrogen in agriculture and livestock, is the amount of nitrogen not increasing? Or are we not deteriorating other places in the world for our own gain? Animal welfare is also less well organized in many other places in the world.

I also wonder how it is possible that the livestock here is halved, based on European regulations regarding nitrogen and sustainability, where farmers in other countries receive subsidies to expand from the same Europe. The same here too: different and less strict rules regarding nitrogen.

Why exactly should the livestock be halved here? Isn't it much more efficient to compete precisely for supply from areas where the correct nitrogen policy is not being pursued? So that the nitrogen quantity actually decreases?",2022-07-18T00:05:58+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

tl;dr: We'll need 60% more food due to increased population, but will likely be able to actually reduce hunger risk because many developing nations have only started using modern agricultural methods such as irrigation and fertilizer.

Weather will be less predictable, so agriculture in many areas will be strained. Severe weather will stress infrastructure and shipping logistics.

It should be noted that meta-analysis obviously had to have a cut-off date somewhere and so did not include the studies after 2018. The percentages for the impact of climate change would have definitely looked worse if some of more recent projections made it into the meta-analysis (i.e. I wonder what effect the ""climatic stability"" [paper](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(21)00236-0) might have had, or the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X18307674) on multiple breadbasket failures), although the projection for future food demand might have been reduced as well, since future population growth projections continue to be scaled down.

I think that this slightly earlier study represents an interesting companion piece to the one you linked.

And calling irrigation ""a modern agricultural method"" is bordering on tone-deaf. I suppose you meant that modern digging equipment allows irrigation to be conducted on a completely different scale from what the ancients could manage, but it was still a very poor choice of words.

You are right that fertilizer is going to be used more in the future (at least the nitrogen one - phosphorus deposits are starting to run dry almost everywhere [besides Morocco](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18326-7), which is going to lead to some *interesting* geopolitics later this century) and that this is likely to aggravate eutrophication and N2O pollution, but that's far from the only issue.  

One thing nobody really likes to discuss is that under all but the most optimistic one of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, the key role in staving off global hunger would be played by something as crude and unglamorous as razing forests to plough them and grow food/ranch there, and that this would be conducted on the scale of hundreds of millions of hectares in this century.

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,ih23u7p,tarrelhunter,,"I'm a researcher in agriculture and climate change and all the arguments siclaphar put forward are valid concerns. 

Nutrient availability, especially nitrogen, is a large problem in many parts of the world and is a far, far more determining factor in plant growth and agricultural crop yields than the marginal and limited gain a plant has from the elevated CO2 effect (check out Lieblig's law of the minimum). I think only a few in agricultural science are talking about it really, and those are mostly the fundamentalists in plant sciences, not agronomists (you might say one experiments in a controlled environment in the lab and the other in the complexities of the real world). Far more gains can be achieved through soil management, nutrient management, plant breeding and limiting diseases and pests.

Plants becoming more efficient in their water use is something observed at the leaf or plant level in a lab but is heavily nuanced at the field level by the trend that climate change is often bringing severe changes in soil moisture availability, often later in the growing season. It's cool that plants are more efficient in their water uptake but it has little use when there's no more water for the plants to take up at all. This is what we're again experiencing for the 4th time in 5 years here in Western Europe, especially on sandy soils. 

You can bring valid arguments that people in history have thrived in warm climates but that's irrelevant. Currently it's all really about the path towards a warmer world and that our societies have become very rigid to the changes which are needed.

Yes, SSP3 may not happen, which is good, since it doesn't depict a particularly appealing world. (*""A resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. Policies shift over time to become increasingly oriented toward national and regional security issues. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. Investments in education and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is low in industrialized and high in developing countries. A low international priority for addressing environmental concerns leads to strong environmental degradation in some regions.""*) All of this is what makes it a scenario where 600 million hectares of forest are lost by 2100.

Yet, even SSP2, which is the middle-of-the-road baseline, has a net loss of around 100 million hectares on that graph. It peaks around the middle of the century, and some large-scale reforestation is apparently assumed around 2090, so that the net loss is ""only"" 50 million hectares or so, but that clearly won't undo the ecosystem damage. 

Lastly, SSP4, which is another quite plausible scenario (quote: *""Highly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. Over time, a gap widens between an internationally-connected society that contributes to knowledge- and capital-intensive sectors of the global economy, and a fragmented collection of lower-income, poorly educated societies that work in a labor intensive, low-tech economy. Social cohesion degrades and conflict and unrest become increasingly common. Technology development is high in the high-tech economy and sectors. The globally connected energy sector diversifies, with investments in both carbon-intensive fuels like coal and unconventional oil, but also low-carbon energy sources. Environmental policies focus on local issues around middle and high income areas.""*) involves a net loss of 200 million hectares.

The authors may consider these numbers ""modest"" next to SSP3, and perhaps on a global scale they are, but it's still hundreds of millions of hectares, and untold ecosystem damage.

Issues like ocean acidification, rapidly warmer weather, erosion, change in water cycles, invasive species, etc, etc.

However, lets say we got our greenhouse gas production under control and could control the exact amount in the atmosphere. Would it be wise to remove all man made CO2? Or would it make sense to prevent additional warming but prevent us from going back into a natural ice age? It seems like an ice age would not be beneficial for our soecies or many others, just like how the rapid hesting of our planet isn't also. I could be wrong, but a warmer climate would promote more biodiversity, no? (While realizing a rapidly heating planet leads to biocollapse and kess biodiversity). If anything our species may not have came to be what it is today if we didn't have that brief warming peruod that allowed us to invent agriculture. Is the fact that it is a normal cycle being disrupted enough to justify going back intk an ice age if we had more power over our armospheres gasses? Similarly, if we could prevent an asteroid strike to save ourselves and preserve biodiversity, but would be preventing something natural.

Basically, no doubt we shouldn't contribute to the anthropocene, but if a natural mass extinction even were to happen that we coukd prevent, should we not also prevent that? Or even a less widespread extinction event like the cycle of glacial and inter-glacial periods? Would climate engineering to promote biodiversity become a bad idea if we removed the strong selecting forces of natural climate change, asteroid impacts, etc?

On a side note, if we could turn every desert into a rainforest with like 10 to 100 times the amount of unique species, with the sacrifice of desert species, should we do it? It would help reduce carbon and could keep desert areas more lush and habitable. Biodiversity is biosecurity, but without species adapted to a desert environment, if some unseen even turned Earth into a desert, we would have less species adapted to said environments.

Edit: I just want to clarify as it seems like people are assuming I am making an argument that I am not making. I am not promoting any positives of climate chabge as we all knkw they are mostly bad. I am talking about the positives of our climate 200 years ago, prior to the industreal revolution, over an ice age/glacial period. Not our world today or the future projections. Like, if we had complete control over our climate and with the push of a button stopped man made climate change, would it also be beneficial to stop the glacial period we would be heading into in 50 000 to 100 000 years? It seems like we would have more farmable land and more rainforest and biodiversity not having glaciers stretch to the equator (while realizing we are going through the anthropocene and mass extinction from our current, rappid warming, as well as things like erosion, floods, dtought, fire, etc which are not good for farming, biodiversity, or humans).",2022-08-03T02:09:30+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

There is no reason to assume we should be in an ice age any time soon if there weren't any manmade CO2 in the atmosphere. Yes some ice age would probably slowly come in some **tens of thousands years into the future**. Nothing we should bother about now.

> but a warmer climate would promote more biodiversity

Clearly depends on how much warmer but even so higher biodiversity does not equal better living condition for us or other currently existing living beings on earth. Climate change is in general not good for the adapted life which will have to adapt again under the cruel process of evolution. And life certainly has not yet adapted to the currently higher temperatures because adaptation is in general not that fast.

Warmer climate globally (talking about interglacial without emissions) leaves more land able to grow a larger variety of crops, and warmer regions to the north for diversity hotspots like rainforests, rather than glaciers extending down close to the equater. Also as humans we did evolve on the plains if Africa but adapted to move into other environments including the arctic circle. So it would seem like our current planet would be better for us and biodiversity than a glacial period. I realize on the flip side, climate change causes droughts in some areas, floods in others, increases forest fires and errosion (all of which is terrible for agriculture, and biodiversity as we may loose the redwood forests in California for example, as well as invasive species moving in and displacing natuve species).

These thought experiments can be handy in some cases. I recall seeing one proposal of seeding fast growing trees onto every island despite the fact this tree disrupted biodiversity in these places and was such a temporary fix that didn't do much in the grand scheme of things. It would seem like, besides less usable farm land, unstable coast lines, and issues with water, the main issues with climate change is biodiversity and biocollapse, but sometimes I see people that propose solutions which only seem to focus on temperature and do terrible things for biodiversity. Like utilizing potentially invasive species in places they don't belong. Seeding clouds over oceans and painting roof tops white doesn't do anything for ocean acidification from CO2 -> carbonic acid. Turning deserts green can store carbon but destroys desert biodiversity (granted reversing desertification would seem like a good thing to do, even if that desert growing would have been a natural process).

Unfortunately this calcualtion is not so simple. First of all were glaciers were we won't in general won't be able to grow crops. These areas are often barren, without any nutrions. It takes time for nature to make these areas fertile. Also we lose areas to grow crops as well, as you also mentioned.

We evolved there as hunters and gatherers not as a civilisation. Civilisation evolved in more fertile or tempered regions noting that ancients civilisations in warmer regions (but still specifically around fertile regions often supported by rivers)  in the end fell (maybe partially because the fertile land was limited) and modern civilisation mainly evolved in europe (civilisation in asia being a seperate case).

So while that argument initially sounds like there may be something to it even if that argument had some merit in regards to the hunter and gatherer lifestyle it really doesn't for our modern civilisation. The plains of africa can't support modern civilisation. Without the Nile I would even question whether it can support any kind of rudimentary developed civilisation.

If we manage to get to the point where we can control atmospheric CO2 it would be very interesting to see where we arrived at for the ""ideal"" amount. I suspect it would be more than pre-industrial levels but that's just a guess. It certainly wouldn't be less than that.

> It seems like an ice age would not be beneficial for our soecies or many others

This is a bit of an understatement ;)

> I could be wrong, but a warmer climate would promote more biodiversity, no?

Of course as long as there is water. Cold is extremely inhospitable for life. Also worth mentioning that global warming from climate change is not evenly distributed. The coldest regions of the planet will warm more than the warmer regions. 

> Would climate engineering to promote biodiversity become a bad idea if we removed the strong selecting forces of natural climate change, asteroid impacts, etc?

Depends what you ask. If you asked the creatures that would repopulate after a mass extinction they would probably say don't do it. If you asked the animals alive today (including humans) I think they would mostly say it's a great idea. Since I'm a human and strongly pro-human I would also say it's a good idea.

> On a side note, if we could turn every desert into a rainforest with like 10 to 100 times the amount of unique species, with the sacrifice of desert species, should we do it?

We couldn't really make *every* desert a lush landscape due to natural factors (rainshadows, ocean currents, wind currents, etc). But I would think any that could be reasonably turned into more productive land would be a positive. 

>  I am not promoting any positives of climate chabge as we all knkw they are mostly bad.

I would say best data suggests this is the case - ""know"" might be a little beyond what we can reasonably conclude. If ECS turned out to be on the extreme low end it isn't unreasonable to suspect the positives could in theory outweigh the negatives. It gets back to your first question - what's the ideal level of CO2? Given the range of ECS (enormous) I don't think we can confidently answer that question.

A side note, the current mass extinction is not driven by climate change. It is driven by habitat loss/unsustainable land use. That contribution percentage may change but right now climate change is not the primary factor.

> I am convinced the mass extinction is largely driven by climate change

Clear cutting forests, mass mono agriculture, pollution, etc. have contributed more to our current extinction than climate change. I don't know of any studies that have assigned values to the current causes but climate change would certainly rank below those (still significant, of course). Think about taking a flight and looking down - all you see is farmland for huge portions of the globe. Hugely disruptive to natural environments.

Less basic water. Kind of a tangent but keep in mind, the modeled pH change is much less than species would experience due to natural variation. Overfishing and pollution likely pose a much greater threat to our oceans for the time being.

Good to keep in mind that red woods [have survived far worse droughts](https://images.app.goo.gl/H4wsG8NqnTCuJyCW8). Many of them are still alive today to tell the story. Redwoods require fire as a part of their lifecycle. Fire suppression resulting in much worse fires and changes in land use pose threats at least as great as climate change to these trees. Only bring this up because it's important to consider all factors. It seems to me that we often have blinders on these days where climate change is near solely responsible for everything bad.

Think more about it in sense that although the climate **has changed in the past,** a change of this scale in this little time is unprecedented (correct if I'm wrong).

\- Plants will be able to live in areas that were previously too cold for them.  So will disease vectors like mosquitos.  

\- As someone mentioned, more people will likely suffer more respiratory illnesses due to air pollution.

\- Ocean acidification (CO2 becoming dissolved in ocean water) will affect marine life, possibly disrupting food chains (a huge threat to coastal economies / indigenous people reliant on these ecosystems for food / commerce).

\- Thawing permafrost, which used to act as a carbon sink, is now a carbon source as more and more gases rise from the ground.  In addition to contributing to increased GHG in the atmosphere, this could potentially release unknown microbes / pathogens into the world. 

\- You think inflation is bad?  When it becomes too hot to grow lettuce and grapes in California, let's see how much more expensive things get.  (That is if California isn't engulfed in flames at this point).

Finnish Fazer explores cell-cultured cocoa as an option,"Some time ago, the world of chocolate fans was shocked. Scientists had researched that due to climate change, chocolate could no longer be produced within forty years. Then the cocoa beans will no longer want to grow. Fortunately, good news is now coming from Scandinavia. The Finnish food company Fazer is going to use so-called cellular growth techniques to produce cocoa sustainably. We have to be patient, the Finns warn. It could take quite a few years to get there, the company says in a press release.

&#x200B;

All Fazer’s cocoa comes from sustainably managed sources in Ecuador and West Africa. For Fazer, sustainable cocoa means securing profitable farming, improving cocoa community well-being, and respecting the planet and natural resources. However, Fazer acknowledges that the traditional cocoa growing areas near the Equator are threatened by climate change and that it might, in the future, become increasingly challenging to grow cocoa. Although Fazer, in accordance with its sustainability ambitions, is committed to combating climate change, there is also a need to explore alternative sources for sustainable cocoa. As part of a larger Finnish research project, Fazer is now exploring the potential of cellular agriculture as a means for growing cocoa.

Climatechange,post,agriculture,z8frnj,jlspace,How to argue the severity of climate change?,"The real disagreement about climate change is whether or not the current acceleration of climate change we see today is natural or anthropogenic. While most deniers are aware that earth goes through cyclical periods of ice ages (glacial periods), they believe that this is natural and the earth will eventually correct itself. Climate change is an extremely complex, multifaceted phenomenon, but I want to better understand how EXACTLY the increased rate in global temperatures is more severe than natural interglacial periods. I am by no means a climate or earth science expert, but I prefer to take a very methodical approach in my understanding so please correct any holes or misconceptions I have. I'll start with stating my current understanding:

I will summarize Earth as having a quasi steady-state climate, meaning the earth has a climate that is always shifting to achieve equilibrium, but if you zoom out far enough on the scale of 100s of thousands to millions of years, you will find this process to be transient; a constant cooling and reheating of the earth as a result of Milankovich (orbital) cycles, entirely a natural phenomenon. While interglacial periods may vary in temperature, the overall trend remains rather consistent. Earth is currently in an interglacial period however anthropogenic emissions of CO2 over the last century have caused an acceleration in global warming.

Now my question:

How is an accelerated global warming any more dangerous than the already existing glacial cycles? Civilizations have only existed when temperatures were stable and capable of supporting wide spread agriculture, so the likelihood of civilizations surviving until the next ice age seems slim to none whether that happens sooner than later.  The ice caps would continue to melt causing the feedback cycle where less solar energy is reflected off the ice thus further accelerating global warming. The oceans will continue to absorb CO2 affecting PH and will kill all the coral reefs, destroying thousands if not hundreds of thousands of aquatic species dependent on them. Ocean levels will rise destroying coastal cities and countries affecting billions of people causing widespread panic, hunger and famine. It seems to me this accelerated rate only gives us less time to figure out these problems, but I don't see anyone working on these problems anyways. Solutions like replanting coral reefs seems like a waste of time if all the coral died off the last time earth reached these temperature levels.

That is bound to happen again and it will be harder because we have far more people but we survived before and so I think will again.

We need to come to the realization that regardless of which side a person takes on this subject the earth does change and we have been very irresponsible. We build in places with historic evidence of terrible floods, droughts, etc. and then act surprised when it happens to us. We've become locked in with tunnel vision to the last 120 years or so when really we should be consulting the geologic record before building large communities.

While people are less motivated than they should be to tackle future climate issues, there are people working on these things. But that work takes time.

We can see by looking back to the recent past that seemingly insurmountable challenges have been overcome by technological advancement. The green revolution is a prime example. While Malthusian-style overpopulation theories are still fairly prevalent, it was the evolution of agricultural technology that allowed populations to be fed that may have, at another point in history, been left by the wayside.

In short, any time we can buy is time we can put towards ensuring a safer future.

In the complete absence of anthropogenic climate change, we would likely see a return to a glacial period in around [50,000 years](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/news/latest-news/human-made-climate-change-suppresses-the-next-ice-age). While it would still be a challenge, it seems reasonable that humans would be able to develop the technologies necessary to adapt and survive that climate before then without threatening the collapse of society. Compressing that window into a couple hundred years significantly exacerbates that challenge.

Despite what one might gather reading the average reddit thread on climate, there are very, very few publishing climate scientists who believe that climate change will on its own *directly* pose a threat of extinction to the species. The far more real threat is that rapid warming over the next several decades and coming century will cause mass migrations, famines, and other humanitarian catastrophes that will wreak political chaos and increase the risk of global conflict, the consequences of which we can leave to the imagination.

You're simply not looking in the right places. Literally just three months ago the United States passed the [largest piece of climate legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act_of_2022) in the history of the world which directs an astounding amount of money to the development of new carbon-free technologies and to the accelerated deployment of existing ones (for a detailed breakdown on the contents of this bill, I highly recommend [Hank Green's video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw5zzrOpo2s&ab_channel=vlogbrothers)). 

There are thousands of startups working on innovative methods of [storing grid-scale energy](https://tracxn.com/d/trending-themes/Startups-in-Grid-Energy-Storage) to provide stability to renewable-heavy electric grids, developing [sustainable building materials](https://www.startus-insights.com/innovators-guide/5-top-smart-material-startups-impacting-the-construction-industry/) so that we can continue to build housing in developing (and developed) countries without using GhG-emitting cement, and even [developing alternative diets for cows](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/wheres-beef-how-food-firms-are-innovating-cut-methane-emissions-2022-11-02/) so that we don't have to execute them all to keep them from farting methane.

If the rates are slowed to the longest of the potential Milankovitch cycles (as in the thousands to tens-of-thousands year range) then many species have the opportunity to adapt in that span of time. Things like increased resistance to heat stress take considerably less time than that to build up in both plants and animals through either acclimatisation (intra-generationally) or genetic adaptation (inter-generationally).

Plants: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35419019/

Animals: https://academic.oup.com/af/article/9/1/12/5146549

However the problem caused by increased heating rates is that ecological niche limits will be exceeded before dispersal can take place. This means that species won’t have enough time to spread or migrate far enough to have the chance to adapt. This can be shown by the survey below:

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,iydcir0,Dieselboy1122,,"Your statement is quit wrong as the Antarctica icecap is literally growing and not melting currently. We are still in the last ice age as well. 

It’s a mystery. Why has Arctic sea ice cover roared back so quickly over the last few years? Nobody knows – not one scientist on the planet can tell you, writes Willis Eschenbach in a short essay on the climate site Watts Up With That? It might be noted, of course, that there was no shortage of explanations when there was a cyclical downturn, mostly to do with humans having something to do with it. Ice melting at the Poles is still one of the crucial supports for the entire command-and-control Net Zero political agenda.


The above graph shows changes in Arctic sea ice cover during the satellite era. Values are anomalies from the 1991-2020 average. Eschenbach notes that since around 1990, people have been talking about how human-emitted carbon dioxide is reducing the amount of Arctic sea ice. When it started dropping very fast, there was talk we’d passed a ‘tipping’ point from which the ice would never recover. Over this time, noted Eschenbach, predictions of an ice-free Arctic ocean abounded.

Old habits die hard. Despite the impressive recent ice recovery, talk of these tipping points – mostly an invention of so-called ‘attribution’ computer models – are ubiquitous. In his recent Frozen Planet II agitprop series for the BBC, Sir David Attenborough made a number of model-produced references to the Arctic being free of summer sea ice by 2035.

According to Eschenbach, there are more mysteries down in Antarctica.


Here Eschenbach poses the question – why did the Antarctic ice pack, unlike the Arctic pack, start increasing quite rapidly around 2008? Nobody knows, he says. Why did it differ from the Arctic by plateauing from 2010 to 2015, but then mirror the Arctic by dropping rapidly, and then turn around and start rebounding? You guessed it – nobody knows.

Finally the global situation.


Why has global sea ice followed this pattern, while CO2 continues to rise in the atmosphere, he asks. The politically-motivated alarmists constantly tell us the ice will soon all disappear. According to Eschenbach, not one climate scientist on the planet predicted these large changes in sea ice.

The author concludes:

Here’s the strangest part. Despite the failure of the many predictions of an ‘ice-free Arctic’, despite the falsified claims that we’ve passed a ‘tipping point’, despite the fact that the reasons for the curious and unexpected changes in the polar sea ice cannot be explained by anyone and the changes weren’t predicted by anyone – climate change scientists still insist that they can tell us what the global temperature will be like in the year 2100.
Of course, there are many sceptical scientists who seek answers to the cyclical nature of global ice outside the restrictive confines of ‘settled’ climate science. As the Daily Sceptic has often reported, short-term movements of ice are affected by often incalculable atmospheric heat exchanges, ocean currents and many other natural climatic variations.

The geologist Professor Ian Plimer recently noted in an essay published by Quadrant, there have been six major ice ages and each started when there was far more CO2 in the atmosphere than now. Taking the longer view, Plimer said that we are currently in an ice age initiated 34 million years ago, the current interglacial started 14,400 years ago in the Northern Hemisphere, and we were at the peak of this interglacial 4,000-7,000 years ago in the Holocene Optimum.

Two American geologists recently found that over half of the Arctic’s glaciers and ice caps that exist today did not exist or were smaller 3,400 to 10,000 years ago. At the time, atmospheric CO2 ranged between 260 to 270 parts per million, compared to the current 410 ppm. At the peak of this interglacial Arctic warming, temperatures were noted to be several degrees warmer than today. Change in the size of glaciers and ice caps over the last few centuries “is but a partial return to a former period of much greater warmth”, the geologists suggest.

Political tactics designed to scare entire populations into following an anti-growth Net Zero future pay little attention to such trends. Global warming ran out of steam a couple of decades ago, and the latest satellite data for November is almost certain to extend the current eight year, one month pause. Instead a ‘highway to hell’ message is broadcast, based almost solely on invented stories attributing bad or ‘extreme’ weather to the activities of humans. Despite the overwhelming evidence from the past that global temperatures can rise and fall rapidly, an entire climate industry, backed by almost unlimited transfers of wealth from often poor to rich people, has sprung up forecasting Armageddon if there is a rise of a few parts of a degree centigrade.

Climatechange,comment,agriculture,iydivqk,Fred776,,"> Why has Arctic sea ice cover roared back so quickly over the last few years?

It hasn't. There were some particularly low years in the early 2010s which make later years look a bit better relatively, but the fact remains that, for example, last year was lower than most of the 2010s. It's easy to get mesmerised by eyeballing short term ""trends"" but they don't stand up to rigorous statistical analysis. Roughly speaking, if there happens to be an extreme couple of years, the following years will start to look like a recovery and any underlying trend will need a few more years before it overcomes the perception of a recovery. Throw in the odd inevitable above trend year and the perception is reinforced. The point is that there is short term noise, and it is statistical nonsense to talk about recovery over such timescales.

We went through exactly the same thing with the so-called temperature hiatus, which in reality was a statistical artifact. An extreme El Nino at the end of the 90s meant that for a number of years there was a reference point that people (such as your WUWT pals) could cherry-pick and say: ""look, temperatures haven't changed in 15, 16, ... years"" by comparing with that temperature in 1998 or whatever it was. Until it got to the point where the underlying upward trend broke above even that earlier peak and consequently we don't hear so much about it these days.

It is so large and so complex with so many moving parts in Brownian motion that you can dump an enormous amount of energy into the system and it will dissipate it through entropy.  The problem is that as the amount of energy dumped into the system increases, this entropy becomes waste heat.  At some point, if the energy inputs are sustained, the equation reaches a tipping point and the equilibrium state flips.  Now to *stop* the change requires an investment of energy equal to the amount which was pumped into it.

We have been dumping energy into this system for about 800 years, with most of it coming in the last 200.  Many climatologists believe we have already passed the tipping point and there is absolutely nothing we can do about what's happening.  The Earth will reach a new equilibrium, and every attempt we make to stop it is now spread out across the entire stochastic system by Brownian motion until we dump 800 years worth of energy into the system to change it back.

In other words, we may already have doomed civilization.  As long as the new equilibrium stops below +4 C, it's likely humanity will survive in some form, but whether or not it will be technological or even industrial is the question.  We may need to spend a few millennia in a new stone age before the Earth recovers enough diversity to support urban populations again which allow for specialization.

As they says ""therein lies the rub"". Your question is ""how to argue severity of climate change"" while your post is about how to sell yourself that first. And you seem to be struggling or at least not finding the right way.

From my point of view, here it is: 

1. Evolution did not prepare humans to worry about long term disasters otherwise people living near active volcanoes would never have settled there.
2. Climate science *cannot* predict anything *accurately, 100% right*. And that is **not** a flaw. We are just not advanced enough (& maybe never will be, especially if climate change continues as it is).
3. Many of them lack information\\time (because of something called life), many choose not to believe in evidence, but most of them do not use imagination (we all have it)  - if climate change is exponential curve, where would we be in 50 years?
4. But ALL of them believe in their intelligence - I **must** know and convinced because I am human being with intelligence. So, if I do not agree it must not be true.

So depending on whom you are going to argue with, you will get different behaviour.

The only thing that would have changed if I has said that was to lose my job which I liked. No bank would ever have loaned money on that because spending that much extra money would have destroyed the profitability of the project. And how would anyone even access the building if it was flooded underneath.

>\-Puerto Rico isn't seeing anything unusual, Madagascar isn't related to climate change at all (it's those long term patterns you guys ignore) and the Solomon islands isn't due to sea level rise as your article even states.

All the islands in the Caribbean are in the line of fire for hurricanes which have been intensifying this century. It’s impossible to argue that the increase in sea levels have not increased the effect of flooding during a hurricane.

The subject was sea level rise, not drought. That and flooding is the problem for Madagascar.

The title of the article on the Solomon Islands is “Interactions between sea-level rise and wave exposure on reef island dynamics in the Solomon Islands”.

It goes on to state:

*Wave energy can interact synergistically with localized sea-level rise (through changing wave refraction dynamics and more wave energy propagating across reef crest onto the coast) to exacerbate coastal erosion (Storlazzi et al 2015) and thus may be a key driver of the rapid coastal recession in the Solomon Islands*

As well as the following:

*Rates of shoreline recession are substantially higher in areas exposed to high wave energy, indicating a synergistic interaction between sea-level rise and waves.*

Basically saying sea level rise increases coastal erosion due to wave action.

Since 5 vegetated reef islands have vanished and 6 islands are experiencing severe shoreline recessions, I’d say sea level rise is definitely a problem.

>\-But it will eventually, our tiny contribution of .012% CO2 to total atmosphere isn't going to stop the 100K year cycles

That’s not what the science says because a 0.012% change in CO2 relative to the total atmosphere is a 50% change in greenhouse gases. Try changing your blood sugar by 50% and see what happens.

I don’t think too many are very concerned about the climate change in 100,000 years.

>\-An AMOC shutdown is not a localized event, shutdowns of the Kuroshio, Leeuwin, and East Australian Currents that are connected to the same thermohaline circulation as the Gulf Stream could make it a global event.

Yes it will redistribute the heat around the oceans and atmosphere. That will cause a change in local temperatures as some will decrease and some will increase. But as long as greenhouse gases are increasing the total heat will increase. If you have any evidence that heat will somehow disappear from the planet then you should show it.",2022-12-03T23:49:21+00:00,,,,,,,,,,
Climatechange,post,agriculture,zct271,myrkwood23,The coming rise in aridity is not discussed enough," Many different effects of climate change are highlighted in popular media, but i feel like the scariest and most impactful one is not discussed enough. 

Yes it matters that sea level is (slowly) rising, that glaciers are melting, and it very much does matter that summer temperature extremes will get more frequent. However i can't help think that by far the most important coming change, that is not nearly stressed enough in common discourse, is the increased aridity that we'll likely face in many areas of the world. You can see it reverberate into a million other effects. It shut down hydropower plants in China this summer, (along with the factories that need that power), and slowed river trade on the Rhine in the heart of industrial Europe. 

Most importantly, aridity means less food. It means failing crops, especially in the already arid and hot places around the world, often places that do not have the development level where their economies are able to produce other wealth that can then be traded for imported food products. In other words, certain subsistence small-scale farming regions of the world, that depend on household farming, will find it harder and harder to make ends meet.  
And the problem unfolds in boiled frog manner. Each year these countries might get less and less easy to feed, and thus more under pressure and potentially politically chaotic, so less and less able to organize into building large scale infrastructure improvements needed to counter this.   
And you can see it has no easy solutions, even developed Europe this year had no choice but to let some of it's crops die (look at Italy or Romania), the scale of water needed for agriculture means you often can't just run a pipe from somewhere else and solve the problem. To me, aridity and related food production are really THE biggest climate change problem in the coming decades.

PS:Yes, it's true that some areas (quite a few actually) will get more rain as well, but it seems many of those areas are not the ones that really need the rain.  

PPS: While predictive models models are never perfect, i found this map from carbon brief quite useful:

Not very well written, at some point I'll rewrite that with a proper model with fourier analysis. But the general points are correct: our present rate of warming is faster than the natural cycles and will take us to a higher peak temperature than prior inter-glacial periods did.

Most models of the milankovich cycles say that we're in an abnormally long and steady interglacial period which will last for tens of thousands of years.

After that, we are due for another ice age, but we could intentionally emit enough CO2 to prevent that happening. Here's one paper forecasting future ice ages at various levels of CO2, showing how much we'd need to burn to stop an ice age:

If you look at the first, many of the outer areas are as green as the central parts of New York. Comparing the map that covers the New York Metropolitan Statistical Area in the full version of the article with google maps and the maps in the wikipedia article about the New York Metropolitan Area, this seems to be Riverhead, Greenport, East Hampton, Montauk, the coastline from Barnegat Township to Cape May, the eastern parts of Pike County and Hammonton.

There are many yellow and orange areas just outside the cities, but close to the edges of the map there are more green areas.

Looking at the map of the whole USA, it's easy to see that the big cities in the second map are more red than the areas around them.

What's noticeable is that a lot of the areas away from the mentioned cities are green. Most of Oregon and northern California is green, and then there is a red area just east of the eastern border of California. I guess that is Reno.

I have looked into the issue and don't think the answer is so clear cut. I know there are scientific reasons behind this claim. Like higher temperature -> increased evaporation -> soil and plants drying faster. But honestly, if global cooling were the issue, wouldn't we also claim that this would lead to more droughts globally? The claim would look something like lower temperature -> decreased evaporation -> less rain. Well, you see the irony in this. Perhaps I am way off and this is a kind of straw man, so please correct me if I'm wrong. But we see that breaking it down like this becomes too simplistic. It is a complex issue, hard to predict. But if we look back on history, the cooler periods have also been drier, generally speaking, at least as far as I know.  


I understand that climate change has different impact in different areas. But I am interested in the global average. To complicate things, we need to distinguish between three kinds of drought:

1. Meteorological drough
2. Ecological drought
3. Hydrological drought

According to this article:  [Global drought trends and future projections | Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences (royalsocietypublishing.org)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2021.0285), meteorological drought has not changed in recent decades. I have seen several data sources confirm this. There is no significant trend. Hydrological drought is very difficult to measure. There might be an increase but this would primarily be linked to agriculture, not CO2 levels. Ecological drought is also difficult to measure directly and is done by use of proxies as described in the article. One such proxy is the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration. Figure 3 in the article shows a 4% increase over the last 4 decades. How much exactly that affects ecological drought is hard to say. If there is so much uncertainty even in the empirical data, I think we tend to underestimate the uncertainty in our prediction models. 

But it would still be fair, based on this article, to conclude that global warming has caused at least some level of ecological drought increase. However, what should be factored in, which the article doesn't, is the increased CO2 level's effect on plants. More CO2 enhances plants' resilience to dry conditions. They use it to simply produce more biomass per unit of water consumed.

So how does this all affect the total plant growth? What we know for sure is that the planet has become greener as a result of CO2 fertilization. Whatever negative affects have resulted from higher evapotranspiration must have been more than offset by the benefits of increased CO2 levels for plants. Or is my thinking flawed? I would love to hear from someone more knowledgeable than me on the subject.",2023-05-23T21:15:03+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

At the time, I was conducting climate research professionally and I quickly recognized the absence of a convenient tool for efficient data comparison across regions, project types, and databases. The absence of such a tool slowed down my work and highlighted a wider issue.

In response to this, I developed [www.offsetmap.com](http://www.offsetmap.com/) in 2023, an online platform bridging this information gap. It provides a user-friendly interface for rapid, global carbon offset data comparisons, catering to various project and regional interests. It's a free service aimed at benefiting the larger environmental community, and I welcome any feedback to improve its functionality.

Whether you're a professional researcher, a sustainability professional, a student, or simply curious about carbon offsets, I invite you to try [www.offsetmap.com](http://www.offsetmap.com/). The platform is free to use—an effort to remove any potential barrier to information access. I wholeheartedly welcome the feedback of the community. Any suggestions, critiques, and insights are invaluable for the continual improvement and refinement of OffsetMap. More than anything, I share this resource in the hope that it will be beneficial to many of you, aiding your research, studies, or simply satisfying your curiosity.

section 11.8.2

> Agricultural crops and livestock similarly have physiological limitations in terms of thermal and water stress. For example, production of the staple crops maize, rice, wheat and soybean is generally assumed to face an absolute temperature limit in the range of 40-45°C (Teixeira et al., 2011), while key phenological stages such as sowing to emergence, grain-filling, and seed set have maximum temperature thresholds near or below 35°C (Porter and Semenov, 2005; Porter and Gawith, 1999; Yoshida et al., 1981). The existence of critical climatic thresholds and evidence of non-linear responses of staple crop yields to temperature and rainfall (Brázdil et al., 2009; Lobell et al., 2011b; Schlenker and Roberts, 2009) thus suggest that there may be a threshold of global warming beyond which current agricultural practices can no longer support large human civilizations, and the impacts on malnourishment and undernutrition described in Section 11.6.1 will become much more severe. However, current models to estimate the human health consequences of climate-impaired food yields at higher global temperatures generally incorporate neither critical thresholds nor nonlinear response functions (Lake et al., 2012; Lloyd et al., 2011), reflecting uncertainties about exposure-response relations, future extreme events, the scale and feasibility of adaptation, and climatic thresholds for other influences such as infestations and plant diseases. Extrapolation from current models nevertheless suggests that the global risk to food security becomes very severe under an increase of 4-6°C or higher in global mean temperature (medium evidence, high agreement)",2023-06-22T15:15:00+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

It is not clear exactly at which temperature increase the effects described by Amanda Little would kick in. The end of the quote above talks about ""4-6°C"" but I'm not sure it applies to the whole paragraph.

There is no mention of the middle of the century (or 2050) in the whole section 11.8 ""Adaptation Limits Under High Levels of Warming.""

Assuming these effects kick in at 4-6C, there is pretty much no chance that would occur by 2050. [Table 4.5](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter04.pdf) from the WGI is a great resource summarizing when a level of warming is expected to be reached for different RCP scenarios.

* Section 7.4.4: ""However, it is only about as likely as not that the net effect of climate and CO2 changes on global yields will be negative by 2050, but likely that such changes will occur later in the 21st century.

Climatechange,post,agriculture,14m9js2,Zolroth,[OC] I Built a Web App to Map and Visualize Global Carbon Offset Projects ~ 7500 Projects," [www.offsetmap.com](http://www.offsetmap.com/)

Two years ago, I started investigating the complex world of carbon offsets , specifically in Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU). At the time, I was conducting climate research and I quickly recognized the absence of a convenient tool for efficient data comparison across regions, project types, and databases. The absence of such a tool slowed down my work and highlighted a wider issue of information accessibility for carbon offset data.

In response to this, in 2023 I developed [www.offsetmap.com](http://www.offsetmap.com/) , an online platform bridging this information gap. It provides a user-friendly interface for rapid, global carbon offset data comparisons, catering to various project and regional interests. It's a free service aimed at benefiting the larger environmental community. Whether you're a professional researcher, a sustainability professional, a student, or simply curious about carbon offsets, I invite you to try [www.offsetmap.com](http://www.offsetmap.com/). I share this resource in the hope that it will be beneficial to many of you, aiding your research, studies, or simply satisfying your curiosity.

Not all carbon offset projects are created equal. And you can see that in the data, looking through the credit retirement data across all the registries you can see clearly how some project types have been widely accepted and bought, while others have been left behind (with many millions of unsold credits).  As the technical negotiations for Article 6 continue, it will be interesting to see what kind of projects will be promoted. 

The web app works best on desktop, but it should still be functional on mobile!

Some changes made in the last month!

1. I have added interactive charts with credit retirement data. The charts are made on the fly with the actual retirement data for each project, so what you see is actually based on the serialized retirement data for each credit transaction.
2. I have completely reworked the Icon system, now it is based on a three icon grouping of Nature-based projects, Energy/Efficiency projects, and Industrial projects. The icon size relates to the size of estimated annual emission reductions attributable to the project. The sizes of the markers are based on the statistical distribution of all the projects. Additionally, I have added project titles below the markers.
3. Usability improvements such as improvements to the Legend, document linking, button aesthetics, project count, and more regular database updates.

If you're curious to learn more about the project their is a blogpost linked at the bottom of the map (i symbol).

Thanks for reading all that! Please let me know if you have some feedback regarding future/current changes.

And don’t forget about the developing countries, which should continue to increase their CO2 emissions until they reach western living standards.

So, let’s try to think of more drastic ways in which we can try to save the planet and humanity from the climate crisis.

I’ll begin:

The Pandemic has taught us that with enough political and societal will, we can take effective measures to greatly decrease emissions, all it takes is will from both the Governments and the people. Restricting international flights and increasing remote work are the easiest ones. Also, transitioning into a mostly plant-based agriculture system, reducing the work week, etc. 

Even restricting international flights for only half the year could be good, or having “quarantine”-like months or a week per month, like we did in the Pandemic, but without the social isolation.

Of course, this won’t come without a cost. My country’s economy is heavily reliant on tourism. Without international tourism we’d lose many jobs. Governments would need to prioritize meeting the basic needs of the population, such as food, water and shelter. Maybe through UBI. But that would require a huge cultural shift.

2. East/West cooperation in a way that accommodates developing world needs. To me, that means a stronger and more democratic United Nations.  
3. Geoengineering to phase down the ""geo-transformation"" humans have done to Earth's climate.

&#x200B;

>Richard Feynman needled fellow physicists about their reticence to challenge authority, using the famous oil drop experiment in which Millikan derived the electron charge. Millikan’s result was a bit off. Later researchers moved his result in small increments – uncertainties and choices in experiments require judgment – and after years the community arrived at an accurate value. Their reticence to contradict Millikan was an embarrassment to the physics community, but it caused no harm to society. Scientific reticence, in part, may be a consequence of the scientific method, which is fueled by objective skepticism. ***Another factor that contributes to irrational reticence among rational scientists is “delay discounting,” a preference for immediate over delayed rewards. The penalty for “crying wolf” is immediate, while the danger of being blamed for having “fiddled while Rome was burning” is distant. Also, one of us has noted evidence that larding of papers and research proposals with caveats and uncertainties notably increases chances of obtaining research support. “Gradualism” that results from reticence seems to be comfortable and well-suited for maintaining long-term support.*** Reticence and gradualism reach a new level with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The prime example is IPCC’s history in evaluating climate sensitivity, the most basic measure of climate change, as summarized in our present paper. IPCC reports must be approved by UN-assembled governments, but that constraint should not dictate reticence and gradualism. Climate science clearly reveals the threat of being too late. “Being too late” refers not only to assessment of the climate threat, but also to advice on the implications of the science for policy. Are not we as scientists complicit if we allow reticence and comfort to obfuscate our description of the climate situation and its implications? Does our training – years of graduate study and decades of experience – not make us the best-equipped to advise the public on the climate situation and its implications for policy? As professionals with the deepest understanding of planetary change and as guardians of young people and their future, do we not have an obligation, analogous to the code of ethics of medical professionals, to render to the public our full and unencumbered diagnosis and its implications? That is our aim here.

Every IPCC report thus far has seriously underestimated the rate of change, and every one has used the ""by 2100"" metric, a metric that allows complacency and excuses non-response. ""By 2100"" means there is no urgency to act, not in the minds of politicians and corporate heads. ""By 2100"" means that climate change is someone else's problem and they are free to concentrate on more important things like getting reelected or making next quarter's numbers look good. There is a disjunct between the time scales climatologists and politicians use and exist in.
