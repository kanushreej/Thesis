ukpolitics,comment,Brexit,l5ks1vx,Zobs_Mom,,"We saw a similar *sort* of issue in 2019 with the nutters elected in the red wall, however the circumstances of the 2019 GE couldn't be any more different. If Sunak and the Tories had a Brexit sized wedge issue they could exploit then I firmly believe they would be able to kick the can down the road, not vet any paper candidates and just deal with it later - its what Johnson would have done (and pretty much did, afterall).

But this time there is no wedge issue big enough. The war on woke broadly only captures votes from existing headbangers. The Rwanda flights and small boats, especially the latter, had potential to shore up the blue wall but it feels like the sort of issue that means a lot more in very local areas (e.g., the south coast). No energy crisis to speak of, no COVID to speak of (in the sense of an exploitable crisis). Defense would have been ripe for exploitation if Sunak had chosen it instead of the war on woke, but it now just appears as an afterthought, not to mention that there isn't much daylight between their and Labour's policies on defense spending anyway.

My point: Paper candidates with no vetting and little campaigning can (and have) done exceptionally well recently when a huge wedge issue is driving the electorate. But Sunak's campaign is (currently) 'Labour have no plan', which I don't think is in any way enough to drive any more than the 'always vote blue' mob to flock to these candidates.

europe,comment,Tories,f7l43cb,222baked,,"You think immigration and multiculturalism didn't happen 100 years ago? If you look at Western Romania you'll see it was a huge multicaultural place with Romanians, Germans, Serbs, Hungarians, and Jews all cohabitating in pretty equal proportions. It is true that nowadays we get immigrants from countries from which most people 100 years ago couldn't even locate to which continent they belonged to, and who are culturally very different from us. However, I'm not making an argument about immigration here. I am not even pro-immigration or  pro-refugees, or whatever. I categorically think we shouldn't be letting everyone in en-masse no matter how incompatible they are with the local culture. What I am is pro-Democracy, and that means admitting that citizens of a country have certain inalienable rights. 

My notion of citizenship isn't vague at all. There are very clear rules to becoming a citizen of a country. Not everyone can can just become one. Most people apply for a visa to get the right to live there temporarily based on some point system. There's criteria you have to meet to become a citizen; tests, time lived.in the country, interviews, ect. They hold a a whole ceremony around it if you manage to acheive the requirements. Finally, you even get a document that explicitly states your a citizen of X country. There is literally nothing vague about that. Then you join the democratic society of the country which means you have the right to vote and essentially engage in the rulership of that country, usually indirectly through representatives, or sometimes more directly through referendums/swiss democracy/ect. That's just how it works in a democracy. Everyone has an equal share of control of the state (ultimately). Nobody can just come in and arbitrarily decide that everyone with a Hemoglobin concentration over 15 has to give up their rights tomorrow and go work in the mines against their will. This isn't the 1500s. 

It's certainly less vague than pre-WW1 and the rise of nationalism where citizenship wasn't even a real concept. Before that people just moved somewhere and lived their lives more or less integrating into the local culture, or if groups of people moved together, they'd often form enclaves of their own culture which either caused problems or their culture would eventually go on to melt together with dominant local one. There weren't any passports, and there wasn't any democracy. You were mostly ruled by some King, whose right to rule was allegedly given to him directly by God himself, who also had the right to expel you whenever the hell he wanted. That's the kind of crazy shit that existed outside of the modern nations state. 

Now, if you're trying to point out that the ease of obtaining citizenship is too lax, well maybe you'd be right, I don't necessarily disagree, but if you think citizens in a country should be grouped and segrated, I think that's wrong and incompatible with the very core of how our modern countries work.",2019-11-15T15:38:46+00:00,t1_f7kqmax,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1.0

I know it’s just me, but I don’t like that turn of phrase in this context. As an analogy: say someone straps a pair of children’s fairy wings on their back and jumps off a twenty-storey building. They don’t (in my opinion) “fail” to fly to the corresponding building over the other side of the Thames. In order for the projected attempt to fail, there must have been at least a minute scintilla of potential success.

It doesn’t matter if the person standing on the edge of the roof (ready to flap their tiny wings using a pulley system of lengths of thread), tells you that they “know” it’s going to be all right (in fact, it’s “going to be fantastic”). It’s of no importance that he is surrounded by dodgy-looking characters, all egging him on. And there’s no difference caused by the insults and accusations thrown at the other people up on that roof who are desperately trying to stop this catastrophe. There is not, never was, nor ever could be the slightest *atom* of a chance that it’s going to go any other way.

Wales,comment,single market,d503lfv,ap_Cunedda,,"> Arguably, Wales would be looking to inherit those costs. Since there's no pot, but pensions come out of current taxation, I'd imagine that it'd be the Welsh taxpayer then footing the bill. After all, you can't expect a foreign country to pay your pensioners after independence.

Arguably yes, but not necessarily. As was stated in the The Telegraph, [the UK would probably treat these pensioners in the same way as expats are treated](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/pensions/11087059/Scottish-independence-how-state-pensions-would-be-handed-over-and-other-key-questions-answered.html), i.e. still getting their pensions funded despite living in a different state.

ukpolitics,comment,immigration,kvynx1b,Stralau,,"So the plan is I don’t need to worry about my daughters’ future because hopefully I can count on Islam to modernise and become a mainstay of liberal democracy? What an odd response. I didn’t even mention Islam, for one thing.

Yes, Islamic democracies exist, but I wouldn’t want to live in one, nor is it a life I’d wish for my children. More to the point, whilst some immigration has had a brilliant impact on the country and continent, other immigration hasn’t, it’s brought lots of social problems that we could have done without, which I grew up with in London, and which I’ve seen develop first hand in a shockingly short space of time in Sweden and Germany. Islam is only a small part of the problem. It’s got much more to do with ethnicity and culture, and the interplay of immigrant societies with host societies. With different immigrant groups having vastly different impacts which are all too often lumped together.

I’m so exhausted of having seen the same sequence of arguments play out: it isn’t happening, you’re mad, followed by it might be happening, but you haven’t understood the impact, to it is happening, but it’s a good thing, followed by it is happening, it’s shit, but you/we deserve it. The Left has been wrong on these issue repeatedly over the last 80 years, more or less.

I care very precisely and very specifically about the lives of my children. A future in which they or their children are a persecuted minority because of their culture, ethnicity or race should be unthinkable, but it isn’t. And I’m sorry, but the weak suggestion that I don’t need to worry because it’s as likely as Star Trek, that democracies exist, and that Obama didn’t back gay marriage doesn’t cut it*, coming from the same people who told us immigration would not meaningfully change the face of the country or continent. It has, and a lot of it has been shit.

ukpolitics,comment,UKIP,ixi41jr,Xezshibole,,"This is an opportune time to take it and not suffer effects of walling off England, all due to one key reason.

UK, and definitely England, cannot and will not properly check Single Market goods well into the foreseeable future. It's waving in SM goods as if it were still in SM, largely because checks cause delays, lowering trade flow. It's the flow of goods, most prominently food. In short, properly implementing the checks would trigger an immediate food shortage, hence the government preferring this even as opening UK market to near seamless EU flow while not getting it reciprocated is deeply disadvantageous to UK businesses.

Scotland in contrast has pledged to rejoin the full EU. Though that may or may not be quick, rejoining the Single Market and Customs Union is definitely quicker and a prerequisite to the EU anyways.

When Scotland rejoins SM and sets up a hard border between the two, England is forced to wave in Scottish goods as it is doing with other Single Market members or discriminate against a SM member. And we all saw how the EU reacted to that during the Trump trade wars. Meaning Scotland keeps most if not all its market share in England as SM and Northern Ireland have.

Meanwhile Scotland walls off English exports into Scotland, substituting it with SM/NI/Scottish goods just as Northern Ireland has done.

In exchange for all of this, Scotland regains *seamless* access to a 460 million sized market.

For the record Northern Ireland is the best performing region in the UK right now, with a nonfunctioning government to boot. They manage this precisely because the SM is so important to the economy, they maintain most of their pre-Brexit market share in England as SM has done, and there's so much former UK market share in SM, NI, and now Scotland to expand into.

Edit: Seems like someone below is so thin skinned they blocked me before I could reply. No matter.

>if England wanted to increase checks 10000x on goods entering on the EU Scottish border (vs. say the French) to punish Scottish exporters it would be perfectly within its rights to do so

And it would perfectly be within the rights of all other SM members to sanction England for discriminating against one of their own. And as we can see from the current and future *voluntary* unequal border arrangements, SM needs the UK a *lot* less than the other way around.",2022-11-23T16:45:12+00:00,t1_ixhfj1w,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0

UK/EU to work out their issues, UK/Scotland to work out their issues, and UK/EU.

A chaotic separation would be bad for everyone, see ""hard brexit.""

It’s not a “reward” to let them stay in this country. It’s just basic decency. Some of them want to be here because they have family or friends here. Some want to be here because they can speak the language and it’s already terrifying being uprooted from your home and having your whole life go up in flames without having the additional stress of not understanding what is going on because you can’t speak the language. Some of them want to come to the U.K. because they feel unsafe in the country they ended up in. 

There are no legal routes from Europe to the U.K.

If you want to stop people crossing illegally, you have to make legal routes. 

I was listening to the founder of the Say it Loud charity - a gay Ugandan man who came to the U.K. as a student and was tortured when he went back to Uganda because of his sexuality. He had six months on his U.K. visa so he just flew back to the U.K. and stayed as an illegal immigrant here for five years because the U.K. didn’t recognise asylum on the basis of sexuality in those days. 

People trying to come to the U.K. are not necessarily people unfamiliar with the country. Lots of people from countries like Syria used to be affluent enough to travel. Some might have been here for university. Some might still have links to the community and are pinning their hopes on that. Some might know people working in asylum charities here. Is it enough to risk your life? 

Maybe not for you, or for me. But living in a war zone can do strange things to your perception of risk. Let’s not forget these people are severely traumatised in many cases.

Determined and consistent government action could deliver this in about 10 years.

brexit,comment,Tories,iuckl9j,maxlan,,"Brits hate europe. The only way to make EU a success is to be a full member. The only way we will be a full member is to leave and people to realise how good it was.

Unfortunately now we have left, not only are the brexiteers pointing out all the shit still happening, but bremainers are shouting about all the bad shit they are doing to us. Which is pushing those on the fence further away.


Like the whole disabled parking thing. About 10/40 countries decided that the UK disabled badge might not give people the same privileges.

Brmainers are like ""look, if we were in, this wouldn't be a problem""

Brexiteers are like ""it is only a problem because those countries made it a problem. Weren't you telling me the great thing about the eu is harmonised rules and no one country can do what they want? Isn't that exactly what is happening here 10 countries doing what they want. So what's the point of it again""

Why has it ruined the country? Because about a third want out, a third want in and a third don't care. If you could slice that up per region, we would probably be having a civil war.

So, the government, which everyone now hates for giving massive tax breaks to the rich, being rich or ignoring their own rules and having a piss up while other people were dying alone, is trying to govern a country where 2 thirds of it hate the other 2 thirds for disagreeing with them.

Overall if they hadn't screwed up the covid response so bad, we could be winning right now. The rest of the EU should be almost bankrupted by the freak weather and taking refugees from ukraine in mid east. Both of those things have affected us a lot less than many other countries.


Putin taking Ukraine was a master stroke. Climate change has destroyed harvests, so he's taken a whole country that is reasonably unaffected and has a LOT of farmland. Next year economic sanctions will be dropped and EU'll be buying ukrainian grown food from Russia. UK may buy from USA instead because we can change our food hygeine rules more easily.",2022-10-30T08:35:39+00:00,t3_yglesr,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0

Labour are a massive disappointment, toeing a ""moderate"" line in a political frame of reference skewed by the Conservatives becoming absolute caricatures of themselves. All of the scandals and corruption aside (honestly I'm deaf to it now, it's just concern trolling, I operate on the assumption all politicians are self serving scumbags, after what the Tories got away with in the pandemic, why should I care?), my main problem with the SNP has been the blanket contrarianism in their platform. Anything that can be used to show there's a purported difference in cultural and political outlook between Scotland and England is weaponised. So many SNP voters are already so diehard nationalist that the SNP could be a single issue party and they'd still vote for them, but the SNP insists on picking up wedge issue after wedge issue to beat the ""look how different from the English we are"" drum. Makes me kinda hope we become independent just so we can focus on voting for policies other than yes/no to independence again.
