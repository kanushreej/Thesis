Inspired by another slightly frustrating conversation I'm curious to know what Labour could do to reach out to young people and motivate them to turn up to the ballot and vote red.

Free movement across the EU has been vetoed. Other policies for young people seem hard to find. Most proposed are punitive or focussed on children.

Where are the innovations that will convince people in their late teens and twenties that Labour has their interests at heart and that Labour are aiming to build a prosperous future for them?

I hope there are such policies and that they can be shown here. If they do exist Labour needs to recruit some young media savvy people to shout about it far and wide in a language that young people connect with and on platforms that they engage with.

Is it naive of me to think that if you give young people something to vote for that they will turn up to the ballot? Surely this carrot would better than the stick - mandatory voting and fines for not turning up. That seems far too authoritarian.

Im thinking of policies that encourage artistic endeavour, musicianship, enterprise, travel, culture, sport and fraternity. The way things are going these opportunities will be only for the rich or the fortunate few who are lucky to find a sponsor. 

EDIT: This is supposed to be a call to action. What can we do to create a positive future for young people. I'm aware that young people worry about the economy, migration, climate and all the other big issues. But  let's have some positivity people. What could a forward thinking labour party do for young people?

We could start by pledging to increase the supply of housing in general and small properties suitable for single adults or young couples in particular, provide more frequent and later-running public transport at a reasonable price, triple-lock the minimum wage the same way we do pensions and generally *do stuff that will improve their quality of life*.

Or we could push back against the idea that buying a home is the only way to have housing security and autonomy

Renting into retirement is not ideal

Look up Vienna Housing Model.

Shocking news for NI. We're the poorest part of the UK and the least equipped to deal with a huge influx of illegal migrants.

Asylum seekers are not illegals migrants.  Once they have claimed asylum they are legally here.

If you want to move to another country it should be a prerequisite that you adopt the ways of the country and contribute to it economically from the off, not try and change it into the way of life that you apparently left through fear.

Wonder how long I would last in Iran if I sought asylum and set up an orange hall and a flute band.

And women and children should be prioritised over single young men. Slippery Slope.

The view of the state pension among this sub is starting to seem a bit too radical. I know it’s expensive. But it’s the one benefit we all get as a reward for paying tax for 35 years. It’s feel a raw deal for anybody if they got that taken away. Not to mention it’s a lifeline for many who don’t have final salary pensions. I know there’s a conversation to be had. But I feel the overriding view here is that people over 60 are all rich leaches who’ve walked an easy life which is a load of shit for most cases. For reference I’m 29 from the north east with parents and grandparents who’ve done backbreaking work into their 60s for poor rewads

Something has to give, people want lower taxes I still cannot understand how its not means-tested like nearly every other benefit. If you paid in for 35 years when tax levels were historically low why should it be triple-locked now ?

Isn't that just a sure fire way to get everyone making gifts of all their assets to their family in their early 60s?"

Just spent a few days in Edinburgh, absolutely beautiful city in the old town area .The buildings ,stone work ,cobbles ,winding streets. Fantastic place and lovely people.  One thing I couldn't understand was the amount of items that were Scottish  items made in Scotland ,some of them deeply rooted to Scotland like bagpipes etc having the union jack on them . I just think the saltire would be more appropriate. Countries in the EU would not put the EU flag on their national items over their own counties flag. 

From 2018:

The fury sparked a response from Harris Tweed Authority (HTA), prompting them to distance themselves from the Union Jack marketing - instead telling of the dedication of Harris Tweed to promoting Scottish provenance.

A statement read: ""We’ve noticed a lot of reaction and disappointment to the labelling of certain Harris Tweed products with a Union Jack swing tag.

""The HTA woven labels and swing tags, which ordinarily appear on each and every product made using Harris Tweed cloth, proudly state 'Hand woven in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland'.

""Swing tags, or any other labelling which differs from the HTA’s woven label and swing tag, placed on a product made using Harris Tweed cloth is added by an independent retailer or manufacturer who has brought Harris Tweed and had it manufactured into finished goods.

""The Union Jack labels/tags were not produced by the HTA or any of the Harris Tweed mills.""

## ELECTION DETAILS

There will be a General Election on 12th December 2019.

**If you are voting via a postal ballot**, you must ensure it reaches the returning officer before/on election day! (*🥕🥕: realistically, I would advise posting it no later than Monday, 9th December*). If you're concerned about the postman delivering it on time, you can drop off your completed postal voting pack at your polling station. [Give your local Electoral Registration Office a call](https://www.gov.uk/contact-electoral-registration-office) for more info.

**If you are registered to vote but will be unable to make it to the polling station on the day**, you may still be eligible for an emergency proxy vote. This must be caused by something that you were unaware of until after the ""normal"" proxy vote deadline. Emergency Proxy applications must be made before 17:00 on polling day. [Check The Electoral Commission guidance](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/voter/voting-person-post-or-proxy/voting-proxy) for further information.

Anyone can be your proxy, but they must already be registered to vote and be allowed to vote in the election (see below). 

If in doubt, [contact your local Electoral Registration Office](https://www.gov.uk/contact-electoral-registration-office).

**In order to vote in the General Election, you must:**

- be registered to vote
- be 18 or over on the day of the election (‘polling day’)
- be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen
- be resident at an address in the UK (or a British citizen living abroad who has been registered to vote in the UK in the last 15 years)
- not be legally excluded from voting

Other elections (e.g. local government elections) may have different criteria - [check gov.uk for more information](https://www.gov.uk/elections-in-the-uk).

There will be a ""under 30s"" special of Question Time on tonight from 8:30pm until 10pm on BBC One.

It now looks likely that an interview between Andrew Neil and Boris Johnson will not take place before the election. [Andrew Neil outlined the situation in a short monologue last week](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-50681041/neil-to-johnson-not-too-late-for-election-interview).

## DEVELOPMENTS

* **Jo Swinson** [will appear on BBC Radio 5 Live](https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1203933060900818944) to answer questions from listeners at 09:00 this morning.

This went from assault to a peaceful protest in 20 minutes. In that time there was no comment from the police. This started with a speculative laura kuenssberg tweet, and it ended when she couldn't actually find any corroborating evidence.

It's this sort of negligent reporting that just makes me incredibly angry. 

She has one source inside no. 10, I'm convinced that is it, and that source knows they can feed her whatever information they want, and she will report on it like fact. She never even tried to corroborate the story before sending that tweet out.

It's a shame as well because there are very good journalists at the BBC, like Katya Adler, that dont get nearly the level of coverage or attention that she gets.

It's not negligence my friend, it's deliberate."

Don't really have an issue with it as long as the Yes campaign are clear on it.

Though I do hope the potential drawbacks of EU membership are laid out clear. Most notably the need for a hard border with England which isn't going to be an easy sell.

The manifesto for this defacto ref is going to be an absolute doozy if it's even going to attempt to deliver that.

The only thing the SNP ever need to campaign on is Torys bad.

No I disagree, they also seem to have to campaign on Labour being just as bad

Luckily labour are on hand to help.

With Starmer being the only UK politician with higher net approval ratings than Sturgeon in Scotland, I agree.

It’s always amazing to see non-political people talking politics during a GE. Know a rather elderly gentlemen who thinks 2.3 million illegals came in last year, that Starmer will give amnesty to them all and (what I consider the weirdest) that Starmer is in an alliance with George Galloway and Jeremy Corbyn.

Aaron Bastani continues noticing that some arguments are not serious, quasi-religious, tribalistic social expressions. Where will this arc end? Is this what having children does to communists?

I don’t think the argument that the UK has had fair trials since 1215 is very credible!

Witch trials were after 1215. Every year we celebrate that time we tortured a confession out of Guy Fawkes which was also after 1215.

Are you saying that those witches might not really have been guilty! Oh no!

Wouldn't it be logical for Sunak to announce the GE between now and the locals?  
If he leaves it until after the GE he runs the significant risk of being kicked out as leader - unless that's the ending he wants? To have a general so soon after the locals would also lead to potential apathy amongst voters that they wouldn't remember to show up for the main event, reducing his risk of a slaughter.

it's too late for that, technically

I don't mean hold the GE before the locals but call the GE before the locals are voted. So Locals are 2/5, hold the GE 9/5 or 16/5. It would reduce the turnout significantly as across the news would be the results and people would have the Brenda from Bristol reaction en-masse.

I want a GE as soon as possible but that would be irresponsible. We want to maximise turn out. He should’ve called it to be the same day as the locals but now he hasn’t it has to be a bit later."

https://news.sky.com/story/united-ireland-a-legitimate-aspiration-but-not-priority-says-incoming-taoiseach-simon-harris-13108977

In his first interview as Fine Gael leader, Ireland's incoming prime minister Simon Harris tells Sky News he seeks closer relations with the UK and addresses post-Brexit tensions.


Leo Varadkar, who is due to pass the baton on Tuesday, was the first Fine Gael Taoiseach to predict Irish unity within his lifetime.


Mr Harris, who at 37 will be the youngest ever Taoiseach, said: ""It's a legitimate political aspiration for people in our country to want to see a united Ireland.

""The Good Friday Agreement provides that framework. You can recognise different political aspirations and a clear pathway for those to be achieved.


""That's not where my focus and priority is right now and quite frankly, it's not where I believe our focus and priority should be.

""We have a peace process that is enduring on this island and is in many ways, one of the most successful peace processes in the world.

""But it's also a frosty peace. I don't believe we've had an opportunity to see the full potential of prosperity embedded right across the island of Ireland through the framework of the Good Friday Agreement.""

Mr Harris described Brexit as ""really difficult and challenging"", Ireland having had to deal with five UK prime ministers, six foreign secretaries and six Northern Ireland secretaries in the space of five years.

He said: ""We had very clear national ambitions going into that engagement, in terms of protecting our national interest, protecting our role in the single market, and crucially, protecting the peace process.

""But I want to say this very clearly, I do want to have closer relations with Britain, with the UK government.

""Trade between our two countries is worth €2.5bn every single week.

""We know each other historically, through families, through friends, through work.

""Britain remains our nearest neighbour, even if outside of the European Union, and I do think a lot of good progress has been made in the last year.""

HARRIS STRIKES DIFFERENT TONE TO VARADKAR
Outgoing Taoiseach Leo Varadkar initially declined to answer the question on Irish unity.

He felt it could be deemed provocative during sensitive negotiations on post-Brexit trading arrangements.

Eight months later, he lost his reticence, saying he believed he would see a united Ireland in his lifetime.

With Sinn Fein riding high in the polls, he appeared to be stealing its clothes.
Diplomatic relations with the UK, and with Unionists, went from bad to worse.

Simon Harris has struck a different tone, acknowledging the aspiration as legitimate, but not a priority.

His comments will be well received in Westminster and by Unionist parties in Northern Ireland.

The incoming Irish prime minister appears to be focused on rebuilding relations with the neighbours next door.

Some Unionists will still argue that a united Ireland is not ""a legitimate political aspiration"".

But why would Northern Ireland remaining British be a legitimate political aspiration and Irish unity not be?

Mr Harris, who will face a general election by March 2025 at the latest, denied the coalition government had been slow to address concerns around immigration.

He said: ""Ireland gets immigration. We're a country that used to see many people leave our shores and go abroad to seek a better life.

""Now we're a country in which people wish to come to make a better life, but we do need a fair and firm system.

""It is true to say that there are some people who seek to exploit moments of crisis, but there's also a need for government to do a better job in terms of listening to communities and engaging with communities,"" he added.

He's a west brit for sure

Who put you in charge of irishness?

Hi everyone, I am a young-ish (getting older) English person who has lived in England my whole life. Unfortunately, the current government and brexit have made me feel politically isolated from the country and the way it is being run.

Vote Tory or Labour and you may as well stay in England or go to Rwanda, why can’t they settle the issues down there? There’s enough people complaining about Scottish getting free stuff so are they going to come up and empty the place meanwhile ignoring the obvious that’s happening in England?"

A 30% drop in catch seems allot better for France and Denmark than a 100% drop.

It still seems pretty preposterous that the EU would even expect any access to a natural resource of a separate country. Why don't we charge them for access? That seems reasonable to me, they can keep the quotas they have now if they pay for it. Then France and Denmark are happy, and we can funnel that money into coastal towns. Every one wins.

Yes, let's keep backing Remain, surely that a party whose only issue is Brexit is second on the polls should absolutely not tell us anything about what we need to do.

According to this the Lib Dems, Greens and CHUK are up 16% since the last election, not to mention the SNP and Plaid. We should obviously try and regain those winnable votes rather than compete with fucking Farage.

BREX is up 20% or more. Working class people voted for Brexit as a response against austerity. Yes, of course we should be competing with fucking Nigel Farage becuase he is going after our natural pool of voters.

Brexit Party is taking a big majority of their voters from the Tories. They're not our natural pool of voters. Our natural pool of voters right now are the ones who voted for us in 2017 but have now switched to pro Remain Parties. If you're willing to vote for Farage and No Deal Brexit there's fuck all Labour can do for you.

Compete with Nigel Farage....ffs.

Majority of labour constituencies voted Leave though.

If we do not grab the leave voters someone else Will and then we will get a right wing Brexit instead of a left wing one. It is not about Brexit or not but what model of Brexit.

If the Tories don't even have a lead among Leave voters they're totally fucked... regardless of what we do. If the Leave vote is being split evenly between the Tories and Brexit Party it's literally meaningless how far behind in third place we are.  In which case why wouldn't we target that 16% of voters who could easily be won back by backing Remain?

Back Remain and you will lose the Leave voters that still back Labour

Which doesn't matter in the slightest because the rest of the Leave vote is being split between two parties. That's FPTP for you.

This figure always misses the point that if they stay, you still have to pay. We already spend around £100,000 per migrant according to the same report just on hotel accommodation and predicts ""The total costs of (the hotel) system to the taxpayer would be in excess of £32 million per day by the end of 2026"". Makes the 300 million pounds on Rwanda a steal.

Yes, but the response to an inefficient overspend based on mismanagement isn't even more inefficient overspend based on even worse mismanagement.

If you want an efficient system, then Rwanda is the choice or a complete amnesty (probably what Labour wants) but an amnesty still doesn't really solve the issue it just displaces the responsibility onto councils. Housing seekers in a country with a very low cost of living rather than four star hotels is going to be cheaper in the long run.

4 star hotels, forcing people to countries with questionable human rights with all the inherent challenges and costs, shitty barges.. none of these are the solutions. They're all results of mismanagement and are not the only options.

Which model offers the alternative then? The EU deport to Turkey at the moment and gave the Greek PM a commendation for it. The USA detain families at the border, or split them up.

Yes, let’s compare only the worst and cruelest ideas around to devise our solution from.

Some thoughts:


- We haven't seen much of Rishi.
- On Wednesday, Starmer is going to eviscerate him
- Sunak needs to try to get ahead of it before the narrative snowballs.
- He can't do anything useful on Bank Holiday Monday
- Therefore, he is going to make some sort of intervention on Tuesday. He is currently trying to work out what. Potentially also crying into the shower.


So, what's the play? Another press conference with no substance? New policy? Reshuffle? Give up and call a GE is presumably unlikely.

He’s going to expand the small boats policy so it includes tiny cars and micro unicycles. And he’ll use the podium to announce it. 

It’s the war on micro-mobility."

Why? Because you can't solve for a bunch of rhetoric.","Suella Braverman was sacked for being right. Rishi Sunak is too effete to care enough about key issues, like tackling immigration, that voters mind about so much



Why don't we just have a referendum on the immigration stuff and get it all over with?

I'd rather just have an agreement and stop the back and forth.

Anyone see a problem with that?

Edit; 

Ideas below are made up on the spot so don't take them seriously.

Yep, I have some issues with that. 

1. How can you ensure that you won't divide the nation again? After all Brexit had an immigration component and all politics were divisive as a result, and distracted away from the NHS, education, etc. 

2. How are you going to ask the right question of the public? A lot of people talking about immigration referendums are asking for straight yes or no, and their justification is it's the 3rd biggest issue for Brits. But, it's a distant 3rd to the economy and healthcare, of which both can be improved by an in flux of people coming to this country. When you poll ""would you be happy with immigration for the NHS?"" The majority say yes. That bit of context helps. 

3. How do you know that you could even accomplish anything? We have been dragging out a lot of policy to lower immigration, but none of it has worked (and for very good reasons). So you might just waste a load of time and energy that could be spent elsewhere to just divide the country and be back in the same place you started. 

There are few more issues to go with this as well, but it's not a simple ask the nation and get on with it.

>How can you ensure that you won't divide the nation again?

Tbh I'm thinking it's already divided and a national discussion would be better than what the Tory party is currently doing.

>How are you going to ask the right question of the public?

Table of immigration limits starting at net -100k going all the way to 10 million. In increments of 100k.

Alternatively set it as a % of the UK population.

If 60% ask for more than we currently have then we allow more up to a level that is acceptable for the vast majority, and vice versa. 

>How do you know that you could even accomplish anything?

Have border controls and limits like every country has had for the majority of the existence of the world.

I'm not getting into the details of you arguing in favour of not having a limit for whatever reason, I just want the back and forth to end & someone to take action.

If it doesn't go my way, at least the government won't be spending all their time talking over the issue repeatedly.

Even if you got all of those things and you are absolutely right on every point, the furthest right will see it as not enough and the far right of the Tories will always break away to appease them. So you'll end up with the same back and forth, and to my 3rd point, you can do all of this and end up back where you started.

And so what? 

All you're saying is that if someone implements it badly that we end up in the same place we are now.

Is the current status quo with the Tories really that great?

I'm not saying it will be bad implementation, I'm saying that there is no implementation that will work because it doesn't solve for a problem, rather it tries to solve a bunch of rhetoric.

Hate to admit it, but Farage is not an idiot (unlike the people he knows who are and will eat up everything he says, including this) and has played his cards pretty much perfectly for this fiasco.

What should’ve been a non-story about a private bank cancelling a customer who no longer matches their requirements has become a complete shitshow, pretty much exclusively because of his shit stirring.

And now that the apologies and resignations have started, which were for the leaking of the fact he no longer met the wealth criteria and not because of the decision to close his account, the previously mentioned mob who eat up everything he says seem to think that they have been vindicated and right all along, and that a high street bank could just close their current account because of their political views.

Quite why, during a cost of living crisis, the so-called “Man of the People” found it such a personal affront that people found out that he is no longer wealthy enough to bank at a private and exclusive institution is another question for another time.

Except they didn't find out he wasn't wealthy enough, the report makes that clear. The dumped him as a client because they didn't like his politics. 

What about when they start dumping politicians who believe bankers bonuses should be capped? Who favour nationalisation of banking? Where does it end?

Far too many people seem to have been blinded by their dislike of Farage to the slippery slope the closure of his account represented.

That’s quite literally why the report existed in the first place, because his mortgage agreement was coming to an end and he would no longer satisfy the wealth criteria.

Many European countries opt for bright, clean, quick, friendly arrivals facilities. But Scottish airports are poorly lit, have awful low suspended ceilings, are littered with posters about not assaulting staff (do other countries not have this concern?), and woeful inefficiency.

One can enter most EU counties on a UK passport faster than a UK citizen can enter Scotland on a UK passport... I also have an Irish passport and just sail into Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy etc in a minute. Shouldn't the UK be able to do this for our own citizens?

I know some aspects are outwith airport control, such as immigration staffing numbers and process, but presumably the ambience of the arrivals hall is within their remit?

The mistake here is that Alison Rose leaked personal information, and she is rightly taken to task for that.

Otherwise, it was not unlawful for Coutts to deny Farage an account, for any reason they may choose.

Would it be ok for every bank to behave as Coutts has towards Farage? Say he was unable to get a bank account anywhere because they all chose not to do business with him because of his political beliefs - is that ok?

No, because high street banks are regulated to the extent that they must offer anyone a basic bank account. Coutts is a *private* bank, a subsidiary of NatWest, providing personalised services to high net worth individuals. Nigel Farage *was* offered a regular account with NatWest, and it remains to be seen whether he took up that offer. But it doesn’t matter. He has the right to open an account with any high street bank and they cannot deny him.

*He was not denied banking services*. He lost the privileges associated with a special service and threw a hissy fit, claiming that he is some sort of discriminated martyr. This is akin to being kicked out of a private club, not some denial of basic rights.

I can't see the question asked, as that'll be a big factor in how people answer. 

If the question is ""rejoin on the terms we had"", I'd expect the answer to be waaayyy higher than ""rejoin on new entrant terms including commitment to join the Euro"".

Who cares about what we had?

The terms for rejoining just have to be better than what we have today, and what we have today is terrible.

> Who cares about what we had?

Quite a lot of people weren't Remain supporters because they loved the EU with all their heart. Many were simply ""I prefer the status quo"". You cannot assume that those preferring what we had will prefer new-entry EU terms purely because we'll be in the EU.

I love how a comment that starts with the assumption the only reason anyone would accept the new terms is because ""they loved the EU with all their heart"" ends with a warning about making assumptions.

It's like poetry written by Liz Truss.

You're misunderstanding the point: Don't assume that everyone who voted Remain would automatically vote to rejoin. The terms will fundamentally be different, and that will change the position of a good number of people.

I love how this assumption is supposed to dispel another assumption and also rests on the assumption that the reality of Brexit is enticing.

It's not that the reality of Brexit is enticing; it's that some of the terms of joining would be red lines."

#Want to discuss the Prime Ministerial Debate between Johnson and Corbyn on BBC One at 20:30? [Go here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/e73p1p/match_thread_the_prime_ministerial_debate_bbc_one/)

## SUMMARY

Three **Brexit Party** MEPs have resigned the party whip and put their support behind the Conservatives. **Nigel Farage** [criticised the move](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50672611), saying that the defectors had strong personal links to the Tories.

The **Conservatives** [set out their plans for the first 100 days in office](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50666262), including passing a Brexit deal and holding a February budget.

**Labour** had to field questions about their approach to antisemitism after seventy serving and ex-Labour officials [gave sworn statements to an official investigation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50666884) into the party's handling of antisemitism allegations.

**Andrew Neil** [has directly challenged](https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1202670854410297344) Boris Johnson to be interviewed by him, saying ""The prime minister of our nation will, at times, have to stand up to President Trump, President Putin, President Xi of China. So it was surely not expecting too much that he spend half an hour standing up to me.""

**There will be a televised debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn at 20:30 on BBC One.** We will start a separate ""match thread"" at approximately 20:00.

## ELECTION DETAILS

There will be a General Election on 12th December 2019.

**If you are voting via a postal ballot**, you must ensure it reaches the returning officer before/on election day! (*🥕🥕: realistically, I would advise posting it no later than Monday, 9th December*). If you're concerned about the postman delivering it on time, you can drop off your completed postal voting pack at your polling station. [Give your local Electoral Registration Office a call](https://www.gov.uk/contact-electoral-registration-office) for more info.

**If you are registered to vote but will be unable to make it to the polling station on the day**, you may still be eligible for an emergency proxy vote. This must be caused by something that you were unaware of until after the ""normal"" proxy vote deadline. Emergency Proxy applications must be made before 17:00 on polling day. [Check The Electoral Commission guidance](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/voter/voting-person-post-or-proxy/voting-proxy) for further information.

Anyone can be your proxy, but they must already be registered to vote and be allowed to vote in the election (see below). 

If in doubt, [contact your local Electoral Registration Office](https://www.gov.uk/contact-electoral-registration-office).

**In order to vote in the General Election, you must:**

- be registered to vote
- be 18 or over on the day of the election (‘polling day’)
- be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen
- be resident at an address in the UK (or a British citizen living abroad who has been registered to vote in the UK in the last 15 years)
- not be legally excluded from voting

Other elections (e.g. local government elections) may have different criteria - [check gov.uk for more information](https://www.gov.uk/elections-in-the-uk).

* **Jeremy Corbyn** [has revealed](https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1202892180160798720) a government report which shows that under Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, there will be ""customs declarations and security checks"" between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.

* **John Major** [has urged people](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50687225) to re-elect three MPs (David Gauke, Dominic Grieve and Anne Milton) who were expelled from the Conservatives for voting against Boris Johnson over Brexit.

So I confess I'm feeling pretty hopeless about the Labour Party's direction right now, we've had two disastrous elections and we're about to lose a by-election to an extreme right pound-shop nazi party because the leadership decided to go ""third time lucky"" on the brexit appeasement ""nobody on the doorstep cares about a 2nd referendum"" strategy with a candidate who thinks conspiracy theories and denying political reality are the key to success. 

It seems that Corbyn's close advisers have a lock on party policy (ie have locked themselves in the cockpit and are aiming at the ground) and we're seeing half a million member's wishes being subverted and denied by Ian Lavery, Len Mccluskey and Seumas Milne.

The PLP seems cowed and cowardly and doesn't dare try a leadership challenge (after the first couple of failures) and we're currently playing a game of how low can we go, just what kind of disaster does it take to bring a sense of self awareness to Corbyn.

I mean, I'm a member (of Labour and Momentum) and I feel pretty completely powerless and ignored. Countless letters, CLP debates and motions, marches and advocacy, policy submissions and whatnot. But nothing, we're still in this fiasco of ambiguity and pining after the votes of old white working class racists who have long quit the cause and rallied to Farage. 

What exactly can we do?
(I suspect very many of us registered protest votes at the EU elections for parties that did represent our interests) 

But realistically what difference can we make to the Labour Party's policy platform this summer?

stop being so slavish to the leadership that they think they can afford to fuck you about as much as they want in 'compromising' on Brexit

quite honestly I voted Green. And I'd vote against Corbyn if a leadership election was held where we had a viable left-wing pro-European on the ticket.

This is the seventheenth part of our ongoing series about the countries of Europe. You can find an overview [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/what_do_you_know_about_country). 

Todays country: 

#Iceland 

[Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland) is Europes second largest island nation. Iceland is part of the EEA, EFTA, Schengen and NATO. Iceland was in accession talks with the EU between 2009 and 2015, until the talks were cancelled. In the near future, Icelands parliament will decide whether there should be a referendum on holding further accession talks. In the [UEFA Euro 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2016), Iceland made it to the semi finals after scoring a surprising victory against England. 

So, what do *you* know about Iceland? 

* The Norse sagas are almost all about Icelanders.

* Used to be part of Norway prior to the Denmark-Norway union, they remained part of Denmark when we ~~were ceded to Sweden~~ became independent.

* Their parliament is about a millenia old.

* By far the most conservative Nordic language. Not really intelligible to speakers of the other languages.

* They still use patronymic surnames.

* Located on the border between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates.

* Soft southerners that aren't even above the Arctic circle.

* Rightful Norwegian ~~clay~~ lava.

Piggybacking to get a question out:

As a Nordic country, I'm expecting Iceland to be quite strongly feminist. How do women feel about the patronymic naming system?  

You can choose whether you're named after your father or your mother. If my father is named Björn, but my mother is named Birna, they can choose whether I'm Björnsson og Birnuson.

It basically just means 'Son of Björn' or 'Son of Birna'.

Traditionally you use the father's name, but plenty of people walking around using their mother's name instead.

This is dumb, but how does this pass one generation? Wouldn't you just end up with bjornssonssonsson eventually? If you are banned after your father or mother how were they named originally and not after theirs?"

https://news.sky.com/story/uk-will-not-take-back-asylum-seekers-from-ireland-until-france-takes-back-channel-migrants-13125515?dcmp=snt-sf-twitter

The UK will not take back asylum seekers who cross the border into Ireland ""until the EU accepts that we can send them back to France"", according to a government source.

The comment comes amid an escalating row between Dublin and Westminster over the Irish government's plans for new legislation to enable asylum seekers who cross the border from Northern Ireland to be sent back to the UK.

Irish justice minister Helen McEntee told a parliamentary committee last week that more than 80% of recent arrivals in Ireland came via the land border with Northern Ireland.

Ireland's deputy prime minister and foreign secretary Micheal Martin said the threat of deportation to Rwanda was causing ""fearful"" migrants to head for Ireland instead of the UK.

As the row deepened on Sunday night, Irish prime minister Simon Harris vowed the country would ""not provide a loophole for anybody else's migration challenges"".

He also said that ""close"" collaboration and cooperation between the British and Irish governments was ""not just desirable, but absolutely essential"".

However, a UK government source said any bid to return asylum seekers from Ireland would be rejected unless France agreed to do the same with boats crossing the Channel.

""We won't accept any asylum returns from the EU via Ireland until the EU accepts that we can send them back to France,"" the source said.

It comes as figures showed the number of migrants that crossed the Channel in small boats during the first four months of the year was at its highest-ever level.

A major operation by the Home Office to detain migrants across the UK in preparation for their deportation to Rwanda had begun ""weeks earlier than expected"".

Ministers from both countries are set to meet in London on Monday as part of a pre-planned conference, involving Mr Martin and the Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris.

However, a meeting between the UK home secretary, James Cleverly, and Ms McEntee, planned for Monday, was postponed late on Sunday night.

'A global challenge'

Mr Martin said the UK government's Rwanda policy - which became law last week after much legal and political back-and-forth - had already impacted Ireland because people were ""fearful"" of staying in the UK.

""Maybe that's the impact it was designed to have,"" the former taoiseach told The Daily Telegraph.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told Sky News on Sunday that the UK's Rwanda scheme was already working as a deterrent.

He also said the comments from Irish politicians showed that illegal migration was a ""global challenge"".

""[That] is why you're seeing multiple countries talk about doing third country partnerships, looking at novel ways to solve this problem, and I believe [they] will follow where the UK has led,"" he said.

Mr Harris, who took over as taoiseach in April, is already facing pressure from voters to tackle migration in Ireland - which has seen anti-immigrant protests in recent months.

He has asked his justice minister to ""bring proposals to cabinet to amend existing law regarding the designation of safe 'third countries' and allowing the return of inadmissible international protection applicants to the UK"".

Irish ministers are expected to discuss emergency legislation on Tuesday.

The legislation is being drafted in response to an Irish High Court ruling that found Ireland designating the UK as a ""safe third country"" for returning asylum seekers, in the context of the Rwanda plan, is contrary to EU law.

Ms McEntee said she would seek government approval for the legislation to be ""rapidly drafted so that the UK can again be designated as a safe country for returns"".

""My department has been working on this as a priority since last month's High Court judgment and I intend that returns to the UK will recommence once the law is enacted,"" she added.

They all must be arriving on the ferries? If they're illegal immigrants they couldn't book flights. They need ID to fly. You don't really get checks on the ferries though.

Illegal immigrant is an ideologically charged term for someone who doesn’t have leave to remain in a country. They can arrive with ID. Most immigrants who overstay arrive by plane. If you went on holiday to Spain and just didn’t come back, you would be an illegal immigrant too.

It's a technical term. They're in the UK without having claimed asylum. They then have moved to Ireland. They're illegally here. Playing on fact the common travel area exists. If you're desperate and in need to get out of your country fair enough. Claim asylum in the first place you land though.

It’s absolutely not a technical term. Migrants can be asylum seekers, irregular migrants, undocumented or visa workers. Illegal is a loaded term invented by gammons who benefit from pretending things are simpler than they really are.

>Illegal is a loaded term invented

The fuck you talking about lol. If you enter a country without the proper status you're definitely there illegally. Similarly if you had a status with a pre-defined length and you decide to just slide on after it runs out...you're there illegally.

Legally speaking, you’ve described an irregular migrant and a visa overstayer. Just because you don’t like it doesn’t change the reality."

Sunaks nervous laugh is gonna land him in hot water in the GE campaign isnt it?

The polling gap could well widen as a result of the campaign.

Yes. It is very difficult to imagine what on Earth they can actually say, or how they could say it, that won't make them look completely deranged. Are they going to solemnly promise to get immigration under control? What about strong and stable government, as opposed to chaos with Keir Starmer? There are no three magic words to save them this time.

Exactly, any promises they make will just be met with a response of ""You've had 14 years, why didnt you do it earlier?""

The Tories are done."

## SUMMARY

Welcome back to another mid-week megathread! With less than a month to go, the election period is in full swing, and parties are hosting rallies and making media appearances left, right, and centre. We've almost reached the point of party manifestos being released, but that isn't expected until next week at the earliest.

Yesterday was another day of electioneering, with **Labour** announcing plans to offer [free vocational retraining to adults](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-50378666) through a scheme worth £3bn, **Nigel Farage** of the Brexit Party [calling on the Conservatives to stand down candidates in Labour seats](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50387254), and the **Lib Dems** [pledging £5bn to improve flood defences](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50380565) across the UK.

The **Conservatives** again [attacked](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50383018) Labour's spending plans, claiming that the plans would result in an additional £2,400 in tax per taxpayer per year. The figures used by the Tories are ""based on assumptions about money Labour intends to spend"" and also ""how much revenue the party intends to raise"". However, the accuracy of this figure has been [called into question](https://fullfact.org/news/cost-of-corbyn-figure-flawed/).

**Labour** also reported that they had experienced a [Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50388879) on their digital platforms. A DDoS attack is primarily used to take down and disrupt a website or service, as opposed to trying to obtain any personal data or hack the site.

Gauke will be standing as an independent candidate in the election.

- The **Liberal Democrats** have pledged to invest £500m per year on youth services in England to try and prevent teenagers from being drawn into violence by adopting a ""public health approach"" to knife crime.

For co text here is my initial message:


Dear Jeffrey M. Donaldson,

As a meme her of your constituency, the fact that you ran on a ballot as an MP was a clear message to us that you intended to step down as MP and take up your seat as an MLA. You have instead decided to stay on as MP and co-opt someone else in your place. First of all. You where elected, not Emma Little-Pengelly. Therefore she is an unelected official.

You lied to us. This is unacceptable.

A by election should be called as soon as possible to put it to those who elected YOU, to see if they would elect ELP. You have no right to deceive the electorate who voted for you in this way and it’s disgraceful.

Following on from this, people are struggling in our constituency and many others over the current cost of living crisis and the fact that the cost of fuel to get to and from work as well as to pay for goods is becoming extremely difficult.

You have decided for me that the Northern Ireland Protocol is more important than anything I am facing. You have decided for me that an issue at the national level where you still hold a seat in Westminster, is enough to not bother trying to help me or people like me at the local assembly level.

Your priorities are all wrong and you are showing a clear disregard for your constituency and the people of Northern Ireland.

For once, I am compelling you to do the right thing instead of the wrong thing.

Yours sincerely,

And his reply:

Thank you for your email dated the 12th May. 
 
I note your concerns surrounding the co-option of Ms Emma Little Pengelly onto the Northern Ireland Assembly in my absence, the cost of living and the importance we place on removing the Irish Sea Border.
 
There are two points I would like to raise in response to the appointment of Emma:
 
The people of Lagan Valley gave me a mandate based on my commitment to right the wrongs of the Irish Sea Border. To do this, I am best served in Westminster for the time being, where I can effectively lobby the UK Government for the removal of the Irish Sea border. The co-option of my colleague Emma Little-Pengelly is planned to be a temporary nomination allowing me on my return to the Assembly to hold my mandate from the people of Lagan Valley.  At that point, there will be a by-election for my Westminster seat.  My mandate to be an MP remains valid until the point of my resignation whereupon there will be a by-election to fill the vacancy in the House of Commons.  My mandate to take up my seat at Stormont will remain valid for the next five years unless there is a further Assembly election in the intervening period.
 
Co-option is a legitimate mechanism within the Northern Ireland Assembly, and while I note your concerns, all parties across NI have used this feature during the last mandate, with some 29 co-options occurring between 2017-2022. Sinn Fein was responsible for 14 and the Alliance party for four, with their leader Naomi Long herself availing of two co-options. The difference between many of those co-options and mine is that I am fully committed to returning to become a Member of the Legislative Assembly for Lagan Valley, and I am doing all I can to make that happen promptly.
 
The cost of living and the NI protocol are interlinked, so I will address both items together.
 
Last September, I set out in some considerable detail the strategy that the DUP would adopt in relation to our continuing opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol.  The protocol is very harmful to Northern Ireland even though it has only partially been implemented at this stage due to the continuation of the so-called grace periods.  There is substantial evidence to demonstrate the harm that the protocol is causing for many businesses in Northern Ireland who trade with Great Britain as our biggest market.  It is worth noting that we purchase four times more goods from Great Britain than we do from the whole of the EU, and we sell far more goods to Great Britain than to the entirety of the European Union.  Consequently, the Irish Sea border is causing enormous difficulty for businesses trading into and purchasing goods from our biggest market.  Additionally, the Road Haulage Association have stated that the increased cost in the transportation of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland as a direct result of the protocol is in excess of 27% in the first year of its operation.  This additional transportation cost is being passed on to the consumer and contributes significantly to the rising cost of living here.    For example, chilled products sold in supermarkets in Northern Ireland are now some 18% higher in cost than they are in the same supermarkets in Great Britain.  This is directly attributable to the protocol.  We believe these matters need addressing urgently and the Irish Sea border removed.  
 
Following my statement last September, we have taken certain actions to make clear that our Ministers are not prepared to impose the protocol and harm our economy and the people of Northern Ireland.  Ministers in the Northern Ireland Executive are expected to fully apply EU regulations over which we have no control and into which we have no say.  It is an entirely undemocratic situation that not a single elected representative in Northern Ireland has any say on how the EU draws up these regulations, and yet our Ministers are expected to implement the regulations in full in a most harmful way.  This is not a sustainable position.  That is why I took the action to withdraw the First Minister from the Executive at the beginning of February in protest at the fact that no action has been taken to address the difficulties created by the protocol.
 
Before the election and during the election campaign, we clearly set out in our Manifesto that we would not appoint Ministers to the Northern Ireland Executive until such times as decisive action was taken on the protocol.  In the Assembly election, we received a large mandate for our Manifesto position, and I fully intend to honour the mandate that we have been given.  Perhaps it is the case that politicians should say one thing at election time and then do a complete about-turn after the election in defiance of the wishes of the people that voted for them.  I am afraid that I am not that kind of politician. I fully intend to keep my word to the people who voted for us and ensure that decisive action is taken on the protocol before we nominate Ministers to the Executive.  In the meantime, my Ministers who are in charge of the Department for the Economy, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the Department of Education will continue in their posts. They will take decisions that ensure the smooth running of those Departments throughout the forthcoming period.  Ministers remain in all of the other Government Departments, including the Department of Health. They can make decisions that ensure our Health Service and other public services continue to operate effectively.  In addition, I am also committed to beginning discussions immediately with the other political parties to agree on a Programme for Government and a 3-year budget so that we can then proceed with these matters as soon as the Executive is formed.  
 
In our election Manifesto, we also outlined the measures that we intend to take to support hard-pressed families, including 30 hours of free childcare per week for working families and others, an additional £1billion immediate investment in the Health Service with more to come, thus creating the resources for an additional 750,000 procedures in the Health Service and driving down waiting times.  We also stated our plans to create an additional 20,000 new jobs in Northern Ireland.  The DUP is absolutely committed to working with the other parties to tackle all of the issues that are before us as soon as political stability can be restored.  You will have noted that Northern Ireland has been included in recent special payments and measures announced by the UK Government to help with the cost of living.  The DUP lobbied hard at Westminster to ensure this happened and we will work with the Treasury to ensure these payments are allocated to households as soon as possible. 
 
The Belfast/Good Friday agreement is clear.  Power-sharing can only work effectively with cross-community consensus.  Given that not a single Unionist MLA elected to the Assembly supports the protocol, that consensus does not presently exist.  It needs to be rebuilt, and solid foundations again put in place for stable government here.  Therefore, the Government must take decisive action now to address the problems created by the Northern Ireland Protocol.  As the Court of Appeal in Belfast confirmed, the protocol has changed our constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom.  This constitutional change has taken place without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland in contravention of Article 1 of the Good Friday Agreement.  The protocol also changes the need for the cross-community voting mechanism in the Assembly, which are at the heart of the principle of power-sharing by consensus.  It is essential that power-sharing by consensus is restored to ensure continuing political stability and that we can work together in a divided society.  I find it incredible that parties who once argued consensus was the way forward in Northern Ireland are now talking about some form of “majority rule” when they were unable to accept this when Unionists had the majority.  The Government must act to restore the principle of consensus at the heart of power-sharing in our devolved institutions.
 
In conclusion, I am absolutely committed to playing my part, as is my Party, in building a more stable, peaceful, and prosperous Northern Ireland.  The protocol is harming our ability to achieve this.  It needs to be dealt with, and the sooner the Government takes decisive action on this front, the sooner political stability can be restored.  Please be assured that I am committed to making this happen as quickly as possible.  
 
In the meantime, we will continue to engage with the other political parties to find ways to ensure the Ministers that remain in place are able to deliver the support that individuals and families need at this time.  
 
Thank you for taking the time to share your views with me on your important concerns.  It is much appreciated.  
 
With kind regards,

&#x200B;

So I made this its own posts, because it's been on my mind, and need to get it off my chest. Fully prepared for all the shit. I don't care. This needs to be said, and im sure others are saying it too, so sorry if I'm repeating.  It's an open letter, so ""you"" is anyone I've seen revelling or cheering on this policy in recent days. Because you need to be told, even if it does nothing.

&#x200B;

**So**

The basic fact is this ""issue""' of desperate people, in genuine fear for their lives (75%+ of claims are approved, so they're legitimate, whatever your fevered imaginatios say) arriving here by incredibly dangerous routes because safe ones aren't made possible for them, is not an issue of major significance to the UK's national security or economy. Our real issues: housing, economic stagnation, low wages are things that are experienced by, not caused by immigrants and other refugees as equally as they are everyone else apart from those well off enough to be insulated from them.

It is quite simply an issue that gets the worst element of the electorate very agitated and excited, and the more barbaric and cruel the ""solution"" offered, the more enthused they become. And so we've ended up here. Which is a very dangerous place to be, because I honestly think people revelling in and celebrating this policy aren't people who I can live in a society with, respect their differences of opinion and ""agree to disagree"". It's a line, and it's one thing to do your ""them coming over here"" speech to the pub, but it's another to be cheering on a policy which is utterly beyond all humanity, completely insane and besides the point so expensive as to make no economic sense whatsoever.

It means you don't care about anything other than seeing people you don't know but think are unworthy of treatment as human beings shown the most cruel treatment possible. At no benefit to anyone at all (this policy won't create a single job, won't raise wages or lower prices, won't build more houses or shorten waiting lists, improves public services or anything you seem to think the lack of it is causing). I think at heart you all know this, you know it won't stop anything, even the boats coming across the channel. I guarantee you it won't have more than a minor, temporary effect. If someone is willing to risk literally everything to do that, do you think this will be some kind of deterrent? It just shows so many of you have no idea what it is to genuinely experience fear and desperation of the level these people are in. No one would risk so much for so little prospective ""reward"". No, ""they"" don't get five star hotels and free houses and full salaries in benefits the moment they're picked up by the border force. I don't know how to keep telling you this, it just doesn't happen.

I beg you, find an asylum seeker and talk to them, ask an immigration lawyer, a community worker, literally anyone who works in the system. Life for these people is at best a precarious, insecure, for an indefinite time while your claim is assessed. You cannot work, build a life, and you find yourself surrounded by an environment where people who vote for this govt treat you with unbridled hostility and the bureaucracy processing you treats you as suspect until you can prove the danger you've fled is real, meaning you need to relive it over and over, telling it to official after official trying to poke holes in it. And say you're finally accepted as genuine, after all the interrogations, the tribunal system, the months or years of uncertainty, fear, treated as though you're illegal. Well you might get leave to remain, some official status, some right to live like everyone else. Then what? You get given a free house, and a job and your own GP and thousands in benefits and everything in your own language right?

No. of course you don't, You go into the same system as everyone. The same system that's overstretched, underfunded, dealing with too many in need and not enough to give.  And it's like this not because there's huge numbers of people like you causing the overstretch. It's because for decades the country has been run on the belief that people in need of comprehensive help, destitution, housing, support, help with complex needs of children or adult dependents, just are not worth allocating resources to. They don't matter. Not enough to do something about. And this is where these people, who've come from places and situations you cannot, remotely imagine the horror of, end up.  Yes, its much better than where they were. And yes, when they do get to a case officer who assesses them, just like everyone else, their needs and circumstances are accounted for in provision.  Just as someone fleeing a violent partner would be, or someone who'd lost everything and was homeless through no fault of their own. Its how the system works. It's imperfect, its chaotic sometimes, it doesn't always get it right. But the reason it's so badly stretched and creaking right now is because it has been allowed to get this way, again, because we have stopped thinking that those who need it or use it are worthy or valuable or deserving.

This attitude has spread over decades and its poisoned our society. There's lots of reasons for it. I don't really care why it's now the norm. I'm fed up with how it's ignorance means it's meant people think something which is obviously a problem caused by a pretty obvious set of people and policies is actually to be blamed on a tiny group of the most marginalised, powerless, terrified and precarious people that exist. If you want to be stupid and keep blaming problems on the wrong causes then fine, but when you start picking on the least responsible and demanding policies which brutalise them because of this stupid misallocation of blame, you're going beyond basic decency.  I've heard a lot of you all pretend and say ""we need to look after our own first"". But I bet you'd treat a non-refugee trying to find council accommodation because they were in absolute poverty, or fleeing domestic violence with the same contempt. I don't buy that fake concern for a second.  Because if you really did care in that way, you'd have done something to make sure we have adequate systems and resources ""for our own"". And nothing indicates to me that people like you have done or ever will do that.

Where you stand on this policy is a statement of who you are, and where we're going as a society from now on. If you're revelling in it, cheering on the suffering it's causing, because you really think it's a problem and this is a solution or just because you enjoy causing or seeing the kind of pain it causes those you dislike, then you're not worthy of respect or toleration. I don't care about your vote, or whether you represent ""the people"" or ""win elections"". That stuff matters up to the point where the policies are within the realm of humanity. This is outside that realm, and so whether you voted for it, whether the courts sanction it, whatever attempts there are to enforce it happen, they are wrong, and any attempts to stop it, to prevent us going down this road, whatever people decide is necessary to retain humanity in this situation, is legitimate.

I'm not calling for anyone to do anything, people should do whatever they feel right. I'm making no attempt at incitement to anyone or anything.

I've just seen enough of the ""send them all back"" brigade to feel the need to write this, because not enough people tell you what you are, not nearly enough of the time.  So this is just to tell you, this is beyond the pale, and you shouldn't expect, after this, for anyone to treat you with civility or respect any longer. You've forefited that. Shame on every one of you.

France is safe country. Crossing the channel is *extremely* dangerous. Arguments about them fleeing from terrible circumstances is a good argument for them seeking asylum in *a* safe country. But allowing those who risk their lives to stay in the UK is only rewarding them for doing so, stoking the pull factors for those who might contemplate doing the same.

I am all for having more safe routes of passage was mechanism for genuine asylum seekers to apply for asylum but I am also very happy to see this dangerous route closed down.

Also:

> Where you stand on this policy is a statement of who you are, and where we're going as a society from now on. If you're revelling in it, cheering on the suffering it's causing, because you really think it's a problem and this is a solution or just because you enjoy causing or seeing the kind of pain it causes those you dislike, then you're not worthy of respect or toleration

You should reflect on this statement. You are basically rejoicing in the fact you are politically polarised - that's not particularly cool

Britain has no ID card system unlike every other European country has, besides Denmark and Ireland, it's one of only a few countries on the planet where you don't have to carry ID. It is virtually impossible to work on the continent without ID, yet Britain will turn a blind eye to it's cash economy, so we entice them here, they can work here and be anonymous. This is a political failure that could be easily remedied without the need to treat people like sub-humans if we weren't governed by the inept.

I am glad we don't have ID cards.

Also your argument holds no substance. ID cards only matter if the employer cares. If the Employer doesn't care if you are legal or not then it doesn't matter what country you are in; cash in hand still works in France or Spain.

If your employer does care then you need to provide your employer with a valid National Insurance number to be able to work. Not having said NI number bars you from working just the same as not having a national ID would in say Spain.

> I am glad we don't have ID cards.

Why?

Not having a national ID system makes life *more* difficult for everyone

Privacy, the right to anonymity. Freedom.

In what way are those compromised by ID cards?

You already have to prove your ID repeatedly. 

It mandatory to do so for employment and housing as well as a whole host of things. Last time I had to do so was registering for a new GP, where I needed to prove both my identity and address using different documents.

I'm hoping there is SOME mechanism to stop someone worse than Sunak doing something rotten, but I don't know if it exists, and if it is Tory-proof.

Theoretically yes, in practise, no.  
  
\> They have the votes to get it through the Commons,  
  
they absolutely don't.

I don't think your answers are correct

Whether it's the fault of Tories, Labour or the SNP/Greens, I don't really care, but the country just doesn't seem to work anymore. You can't seem to do anything frankly without running into a massive number of problems. It's exhausting.

My theory is it's the fault of both Brexit and austerity, so it is probably worse south of the border too.

Is anyone else experiencing this?

Definitely a bad patch. I don't think we ever really recovered from 2008 either.

Here, relevant section from UK gov website:

> What you need to know

> The UK does not have work permits. The UK’s domestic rules allow musicians, entertainers and artists from non-visa national countries, such as EU Member States and the US, to come to undertake paid work in the UK for up to:

>>1 month without requiring a visa if they are invited to the UK by a UK-based client or organisation, and paid by a UK source (under the permitted paid engagement visitor rules).

>>3 months without requiring a visa if they have been assigned a certificate of sponsorship by a licensed sponsor under the Temporary Work - Creative Worker visa concession.

> https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visiting-the-uk-as-a-creative-professional-from-a-non-visa-national-country


They were coming for less than 30 days so the first option was applicable, but immigration officer asked for Certificate of Sponsorship which is only needed for visits upto 3 months.

Erm, is that a typo?","Question from a foreigner, why not stay out of Europe on Labour terms for a while?

First, I am from Spain, but I follow British politics very closely. I lived in the UK for 10 years and my wife is British. I support remainers position strongly, but I also want a more left-wing Europe, less tax heavens, less influence from big corporations, support for national health services, cheap education, workers rights etc. 

&#x200B;

What is coming from the UK, is a extreme right-wing brexitier party that supports privatization of national health services and strongly supported from edge funds and speculators, and in the side of the remainers, the Lib Dems, that is also a right wing party, that helped to make education unaffordable for lower classes, and that is going to probably to support privatization of health services. What will we expect they will do in the european parliament?

&#x200B;

The alternative is what Labour is proposing, stay in the custom union, and close alignment with the single market. This position has been defined as being in the European union but without making the rules....

&#x200B;

Here is my question, is it not ideal that position (Labour's plan)?  I may be a bit naive. But it will keep the Brexit Party, the Lib Dems and the Tories out of deciding how Europe works but still keep most of the benefits of being in Europe.

So, they disliked his political views, but respected him as a customer. Then when he wasn’t eligible to be a customer anymore, they moved him to a different brand (still the same bank) and Nazi Kermit spat the dummy, threw a tantrum and is still tantruming months later. Did I miss anything?

Just that he's absolutely proven himself to be a massive reputational risk by his tantrum throwing.

But anyone with half a brain knew that years ago so its funny watching Coutts ruin their own reputation when they were perfectly happy with him when he was rich.

>risk by his tantrum throwing.

More the company he keeps. Though not explicitly mentioned it was clear the Russian connection was an issue for the bank.

Like most people can probably guess Prince Andrew banks with Coutts but it's unlikely they'd have to freeze his assets

>Though not explicitly mentioned

It was explicitly mentioned that they had no evidence at all of Russian money.

>It was explicitly mentioned that they had no evidence at all of Russian money.

As I've said elsewhere, thats kind of my point...

What they said specifically was

>NF *seemingly* has no *direct* links with Russia, however:

Not being able to prove anything conclusively; it makes sense to me as to why they might be scrambling to find any other legitimate reason to de-bank.

What's not clear is if Farage hold accounts elsewhere (whatever grumblings he might make publicly about trying to find an alternative in the UK). He's a former investment banker so I can't  imagine he holds all his money in one place and I don't think he (or Putin for that matter) is stupid enough to link payments he may or may not have received from Russia to his usual business account.

Also, as the bank points out, he has a *very* close relationship ~~Arron Banks~~ \[Third Party Data Deleted\] who definitely did bankroll him for some time. His relationship with alleged relationship with Russia and arrangements with Russian state owned banks is definitely questionable.

>As I've said, kind of my point...


No, it's the opposite of your point.

Have you considered a career in politics lmao.

>Not being able to prove anything conclusively; it makes sense to me as to why they might be scrambling to find any other legitimate reason to de-bank.

The however following that is all nonsensical conjecture about public statements, retweets and youtube videos etc, not financial dealings.

As I said, it's explicitly states that they have no evidence of dodgy dealings with Russian money.

Sure. But Coutts have no evidence of any of this.

And Coutts are not the government, nor our secret service or indeed our judiciary. They are a private company.

It's not their place to take it upon themselves to debank Farage when they have no evidence of wrong doing.

You're also ignoring that they explicitly mention his views around diversity etc which is nothing to do with Russia.

Apolls I meant in response to someone who already raised this question elsewhere. Will amend

>It's not their place to take it upon themselves to debank Farage when they have no evidence of wrongdoing.

As you've said, they're a private business. It's entirely their place.

>You're also ignoring that they explicitly mention his views around diversity etc which is nothing to do with Russia.

Having worked for RBS/Natwest I know they do not give two shits about values, which further reinforces my view the decision can be read between the lines of what was said.

For context... 

I'm Irish and was chatting to an American colleague. It came up in conversation that she landed in Heathrow on a trip to visit her friend in Edinburgh. At customs she was asked the nationality of the person she was visiting. She answered ""Scottish"" and apparently then got a hard time from the officer who said ""They're not Scottish, they're British."" 

It felt odd to me. My colleague said ""well I guess it's a bit like a state in the US now"" and I went into Scotland being it's own established nation before the union, how it had its own parliament, how it had a national rugby team, football team, flag etc. 

In the end I was like ""so it should have been fine to say Scottish.""
Their response ""Ok so next time I get a hard time at immigration I'll tell them an Irish guy at work said it was fine."" 
Which is a fair point. 


So, was it a case of the immigration officer being prickly or do ye all answer British when an official nationality question comes up?

Not from Scotland but I view nationality and citizenship as different things. Scotland and Scottish people have their own identity therefore they are a nation.

Andrea Leadsom and Give join a growing list of Tory MPs who won't stand for re-election

Prior to Brexit, love them or loathe them you could rarely accuse the Conservatives of being stupid, and some were committed to the betterment of the country (in their own way).

Post Brexit, the paucity of decency and intellectual heft was remarkable. Gullis, Braverman, Patel, Frost, Fabricant, Johnson etc etc etc.

Sunak, who some see as a more logical and calmer leader after the last 2 nutcases, is giving 2 fingers to the Conservative party by giving them such little time to react. Perhaps he's flipping the bird in order to be ready life Stateside.

Now that their electoral demise is practically definitive, every one of them that can do something else is abandoning the sinking Tory ship. Gove, Leadsom, Merriman, Jo Churchill, deputy speaker Dame Eleanor Laing, Greg Clark, Theresa May, ex-chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and former defence secretary Ben Wallace.

Paper candidates will be appointed just to fill the gaps. Imagine the twisted, worthless, xenophobic, reprobates that will seek to out- Reform the Reform party as they chase the ardent Leavers.

I don't see the Tories having a change of heart and recanting their post Brexit ideology.

The standard line is the EU never compromises on anything. Just look at the way they treated Greece.

And just look at the way they were treating Italy - except they've suddenly backed down on the Italian issue.

On 21st November, the EU threatened to open an excessive deficit procedure on Italy, fining it for disobedience. The Italians had wanted to run a deficit of 2.4%, and then offered to run a deficit of 2.04%, but the Commission wanted them to hold to what the previous govt had pledged, which was a deficit of 0.8% of GDP.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-italy-excessive/eu-commission-says-italy-faces-excessive-deficit-action-idUSKCN1NQ1D6

>BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Italy’s 2019 budget fails to comply with euro zone rules and so the government should face action from the European Union to reduce its deficit, the European Commission said on Wednesday.

>“The debt criterion ... should be considered as not complied and ... a debt-based Excessive Deficit Procedure is thus warranted,” Valdis Dombrovskis, the Commission’s vice president for the euro, told reporters.

>“Euro area countries are in the same team and should be playing by the same rules,” he added. “These rules are there to protect us. They provide certainty, stability and mutual trust.” 

>Economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici described Italy’s move as “particularly serious”. 

Then last Wednesday (19th December), the EU suddenly changed their minds:

https://www.politico.eu/article/fears-of-euroskepticism-blunt-commission-budget-threats-against-rome-salvini-juncker/

>The European Commission on Wednesday backed down from a fight with Italy over the country’s spending plans for 2019 amid fears that a continuing standoff could trigger a surge in Euroskepticism ahead of the European Parliament election.

>Instead, the EU’s executive arm compromised with Rome on its controversial budget plans, which include costly initiatives such as a flat tax and a basic income for the poor, by opting against the launch of a disciplinary measure known as an excessive deficit procedure (EDP) ""at this stage.""

>Cracking down on member countries too hard could embolden Euroskeptics, especially “if you totally ignore the overall atmosphere in the EU … or if you ignore the upsurge of nationalism,” warned the Commission’s economic and financial affairs chief, Pierre Moscovici. He also suggested that a similar “flexible and intelligent” approach would be taken with other EU countries.

>Francesco Uva, an MP from the governing 5Star Movement, called the result a “historic success,” noting the government was able to avoid the disciplinary action while also ensuring campaign promises like the basic income and a major pensions overhaul would go ahead.

>“Thanks to our constructive dialogue with Brussels, we were able to prove austerity isn’t the unavoidable destiny of our country,” he said in a statement.

>Government sources in Rome nonetheless admitted that they were extremely satisfied with the result and praised Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s key role in the negotiations. 

Yup, the EU accepted the offer of a 2.04% deficit they had rejected just a few weeks earlier.

So what happened?

In a word, **France**.

Macron caved to the protestors and made spending pledges that would take France's deficit to 3.5% of GDP.

The EU was then faced with also punishing France, or caving on the Italian issue. They chose to cave.

## What does this have to do with Brexit?

If No Deal Brexit threatens either France or Germany, the EU will again do it's caving routine. 

So watch for GDP figures in January. 

German Q4 GDP figures come out on 15th January 2019. They had a bad Q3 (contracted by 0.2%), and if they have a bad Q4, they're officially in recession.

I have mixed feelings about Scottish independence.  On the one hand I agree with the notion of democratic autonomy for people, and if I lived in Scotland I would share the Scots' frustration with voting to remain and against the Tories and for trans rights but getting Brexit a Tory government and their legitimate legislation for trans rights quashed by Westminster.

I have the selfish reason that Scottish independence would condemn us south of the border to permanent Tory government. But I accept that is our problem, not the Scots'.

I also suspect ot would be economically disastrous for Scotland on a greater scale than the economic disaster that is Brexit. I get the impression that Tories are relaxed about the prospect of Scottish independence because of both the electoral benefit to them and that they see Scotland as an economic liability. 

I also have a deep distaste for any sort of nationalism.

Tory minister should have the intelligence service riding his ass.

He's correct.

>""So these are British citizens, they have the absolute right as any other British citizen does, to invest in and be part of the British political scene.

The fact that they are Russian does not change this.

Britain has its interests. If some of its citizens are disloyal to them it is against national interest for them to be able to hamper the nation. Russian nation is clearly hostile - we speak about civility/manners/etc with a Russia with 0 interest in democratic values. Where you want to arrive eith this?

You are suggesting what? Segregating citizens based on their ethnicity? I think you should look up internment camps and what it did to Japanese communities in North America as the ultimate end point of such thinking. Citizens are citizens and entitled to the same rights, privledges, and responsibilities as anyone else. The issue should be making citizenship requirements more stringent to weed out those disloyal to your country. Once a citizen, that is that.

> The issue should be making citizenship requirements more stringent to weed out those disloyal to your country. 

Do you realize you're arguing for the same thing then? You desire the levels before becoming ""citizen"" to be tiered while the poster above you clearly desires those levels within what is called citizenship.

You both desire segregation and disagree on the time and the nomenclature for it. Borders, citizen status, special status (like ministers' immunity against the law etc.) are all segregation. It doesn't mean they're bad things. There's no such thing as absolute freedom. Interment camps for japanese citizens were done because of ongoing war with the country of origin of their ancestors. 

It may be strange and ""illegal"" BUT there's no precedent for multi-cultural countries like America was at the time and they dealt with it the best they could, considering the grave potential danger to the country. 

If a black man murders someone, you can't just ignore his color on account of being racist - even though there are laws against being racist. Racial profiling is a relevant *thing* both in service of evil (crimes against them) and good (enabling minorities) and simple business (detaining criminals of that minority).

>that is that

Is not how society functions. It's how pedants on reddit do.

Segregating based on citizenship is kind of a no brainer and sort of transcends race. Like, who would you trust more to uphold your values and share the country with; Cabral Ibracka or some random white guy from Siberia? 

This has nothing to with with absolute freedom. As citizens we should have equal rights because we're a democracy and nobody is inherently more valuable or worthy of protection than another. There is no such thing as special privledges for one class of citizens over another. It's antithetical to democracy, and if you don't like agree, you are living in the wrong system for your values. 

Your comment has some racist overtones that aren't for me to unpack.

> a no brainer and sort of transcends race. Like, who would you trust more to uphold your values and share the country with; Cabral Ibracka or some random white guy from Siberia? 

It WAS/ USED TO BE. Way back in the day citizenship was not easily obtainable even if you immigrated. There was no real due process. Right now you can have hundreds of thousands of immigrants across the span of 20 years - something inconceivable a century ago for many reasons, transport being the biggest one.

Technically speaking you cannot trust today's multicultural societies by the same criteria as this vague ""citizenship"" of which you speak since it is a hollow criteria whereas back in less multicultural societies you had - along with tons of racism and biggotry - a lot of confidence in that your people are of the same status as your own.

Citizenship these days does not reflect the same social adhesion and as a direct result there could be plenty of people in your country without your values.

> As citizens we should have equal rights because we're a democracy and nobody is inherently more valuable or worthy of protection than another.

Except you just said the values your people have enable you to trust them - or not - therefore how valuable someone is legally depends on it. If you think i'm racist, why do most countries have criteria for immigration and don't do it randomly? Why do they care who comes in? There's a reason and it's the national values and its adherence which some countries logically require for citizenship - this is not always the case however.

The discussion itself has racist overtones but overall skin color is just one of a myriad of criteria. I don't think having a degree or not is a racial differentiator so much as just status and values.

tl;dr : what you consider citizenship is meaningless without many similarities between the citizens that are more than just their status of citizen.

So I just watched this interview [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTs0fomqSmo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTs0fomqSmo) I just wanted to refresh myself on what Starmer stands for, what policies we can expect if the Tories lose their grip on power. Here are a few bullet points:

* C4:""tax cuts or austerity?"", KS says he only wants economic growth (tories, and probably everyone else would like economic growth, I think.)
* He wants a 'fair taxing system': ""value for money"", businesses are 'being held back'
* wants a preventative, 'cost effective'  model  for NHS (and crime)
* wants to talk to people who 'win elections'
* C4:""what do you stand for?"", KS: grow the economy, growth should be strong, secure, inclusive. Britain could become the leader in green tech or nuclear (or something?)
* ""I didn't break any rules in durham, remember?""

All in all, I find him deeply unappealing. He sounds like he could be a decent manager of a medium-sized business but he's an utterly visionless politician. It's literally managerial politics. In other words, there is no real difference between him and the tories, except a slightly different style in regards to policies and a less scandalous public profile.... I understand he's trying to appeal to tory voters, but I still find it horribly depressing overall.

This strategy is terrible, imo. I understand the impulse not to tack left (after Corbyn) but with Starmer the labour party appears barely even left of centre. Is it really so hard for him to say 'high earners need to pay more tax'??? or 'the unions have my support'??? There are plenty of examples of centrist or big tent parties, the SNP is one of them; if he really wanted to reform the labour party maybe that would have been a better strategy.

As a Scottish person I'm also pretty disappointed he can't even bring himself to support a new referendum. Democracy is abstract, I suppose. The thing is, after the last one we got further devolution. Even if the next one ends with another 'no' - we're going to get more devolution, too bad if you don't like it. You know that 'levelling up' stuff - we don't really need it because we have devolution and - no disrespect but - I'm glad we don't look like some parts of England, this [map](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DcVkyLTVMAAMpiq?format=jpg&name=900x900) is pretty telling.  IIRC, Scotland has almost always been instrumental in securing westminister for Labour - so why doesn't Starmer just make an alliance with the SNP?

Like I said: visionless.

\- apologies for any incoherence, just expressing my feelings and POV here -

>I just wanted to refresh myself on what Starmer stands for, what policies we can expect if the Tories lose their grip on power

I think you're being slightly disingenuous here, this doesn't read like a balanced take tbh.

Let's remind ourselves of what KS has stated his policies are:

But before the long read the summary would be.

Increase tax on the most wealth businesses.

Tax the 5% more, and has also talked about a weath tax.

Stop speculation on housing from foreign parties

Protect public resources

Reinforce workers rights

Increase devolution



Economic justice

Increase income tax for the top 5% of earners, reverse the Tories’ cuts in corporation tax and clamp down on tax avoidance, particularly of large corporations. No stepping back from our core principles.

Social justice

Abolish Universal Credit and end the Tories’ cruel sanctions regime. Set a national goal for wellbeing to make health as important as GDP; Invest in services that help shift to a preventative approach. Stand up for universal services and defend our NHS. Support the abolition of tuition fees and invest in lifelong learning.

Climate justice

Put the Green New Deal at the heart of everything we do. There is no issue more important to our future than the climate emergency. A Clean Air Act to tackle pollution locally. Demand international action on climate rights.

Promote peace and human rights

No more illegal wars. Introduce a Prevention of Military Intervention Act and put human rights at the heart of foreign policy. Review all UK arms sales and make us a force for international peace and justice.

Common ownership

Public services should be in public hands, not making profits for shareholders. Support common ownership of rail, mail, energy and water; end outsourcing in our NHS, local government and justice system.

Defend migrants’ rights

Full voting rights for EU nationals. Defend free movement as we leave the EU. An immigration system based on compassion and dignity. End indefinite detention and call for the closure of centres such as Yarl’s Wood.

Strengthen workers’ rights and trade unions

Work shoulder to shoulder with trade unions to stand up for working people, tackle insecure work and low pay. Repeal the Trade Union Act. Oppose Tory attacks on the right to take industrial action and the weakening of workplace rights.

Radical devolution of power, wealth and opportunity

Push power, wealth and opportunity away from Whitehall. A federal system to devolve powers – including through regional investment banks and control over regional industrial strategy. Abolish the House of Lords – replace it with an elected chamber of regions and nations.

Equality

Pull down obstacles that limit opportunities and talent. We are the party of the Equal Pay Act, Sure Start, BAME representation and the abolition of Section 28 – we must build on that for a new decade.

Effective opposition to the Tories

Forensic, effective opposition to the Tories in Parliament – linked up to our mass membership and a professional election operation. Never lose sight of the votes ‘lent’ to the Tories in 2019. Unite our party, promote pluralism and improve our culture. Robust action to eradicate the scourge of antisemitism. Maintain our collective links with the unions

I agree it's not a balanced take, but invoking the ten pledges is wrong.

Doing so is basically the 1930s all over again.,"Minimum Income Requirement reduced. See ‘Legal migration statement: estimated immigration impacts’



My partner is an immigrant and we live in the UK. Fortunately she has settlement and is unaffected. However I really hate the rise in income required. We need to tighten and get the numbers of people coming into the country under control. It is absolutely a problem. But IMO this is the wrong way about it. I feel that it is targeting the type of people that have a net benefit to the country. I’ve got several friends who will be affected and it’s just so sad. They’re the type that work hard, integrate well, have excellent English, befriend everyone, do a lot in and out of their respective communities.

We all know this is rubbish as there are whole towns and even parts of cities where people don't speak English, don't work and actively hate the UK.

This is why the minimum salary needs to be increased. Because you need to integrate and work to be a benefit to society.

I agree with the first part. However I don’t know what the solution is in separating out people who act like that and those who don’t. Like I said, the people I do know personally are not the people you’re talking about, however I know they exist.

There is no legal way to separate them out. Doing so is basically the 1930s all over again."

This one is silly, but as someone with an immigrant background I find British self-depreciation or negative views on Britain quite annoying. I get that it’s usually mostly done for fun or in a humble spirit but it sometimes gets on my nerves and I am not sure why. Constantly talking about how bad the UK is or complaining about how rubbish it is.

I guess it’s because I have travelled to many poor countries that to me it to comes of as first word problems or someone who isn’t aware of their true privilege compared to 90% of the world.

This is a 3 way split - Hard/Soft/No Brexit.

Hard Brexit got 34.9%, Soft Brexit got 23.19% and No Brexit got 40.39%.

So whilst Brexit may have got more % as a total, it's split between two mutually exclusive propositions which are incompatible with each other.

edit: by Soft, I mean ""leave with some sort of deal"", which is the Labour & Conservative position.

Labour is more likely to vote with the Lib Dems than they are with the Hard Brexit parties though.

Dependng on how you define ""soft Brexit"" a lot can change. Is being in a Norway type deal really Brexit? It's basically just a name change and all the important bits remain the same other than the lack of MEPs.

Of course it's Brexit.  It's what most of the campaign was run on."

### There are less than 2 weeks to register to vote in time for the next election. You can register online at [gov.uk/register-to-vote](https://gov.uk/register-to-vote).

## SUMMARY

Welcome back to another mid-week megathread! With less than a month to go, the election period is in full swing, and parties are hosting rallies and making media appearances left, right, and centre. We've almost reached the point of party manifestos being released, but that isn't expected until next week at the earliest.

Yesterday was another day of electioneering, with **Labour** announcing plans to offer [free vocational retraining to adults](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-50378666) through a scheme worth £3bn, **Nigel Farage** of the Brexit Party [calling on the Conservatives to stand down candidates in Labour seats](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50387254), and the **Lib Dems** [pledging £5bn to improve flood defences](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50380565) across the UK.

The **Conservatives** again [attacked](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50383018) Labour's spending plans, claiming that the plans would result in an additional £2,400 in tax per taxpayer per year. The figures used by the Tories are ""based on assumptions about money Labour intends to spend"" and also ""how much revenue the party intends to raise"". However, the accuracy of this figure has been [called into question](https://fullfact.org/news/cost-of-corbyn-figure-flawed/).

**Labour** also reported that they had experienced a [Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50388879) on their digital platforms. A DDoS attack is primarily used to take down and disrupt a website or service, as opposed to trying to obtain any personal data or hack the site.

*Today's megathread is being maintained primarily by /u/jaydenkieran and u/carrot-carrot.*

## DEVELOPMENTS

*Context added for non-UK visitors. All times GMT (UK) unless otherwise stated. If anything is missing here, ping /u/jaydenkieran or u/carrot-carrot.*


**TODAY:**

- **Labour** have promised to [spend more on the NHS](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50397847) than the Tories, increasing the NHS budget to £155bn by 2023-24. This is £6bn higher than the 5-year plan laid out by the current Conservative government last year.

- **David Gauke**, the former justice secretary (and one of the MPs expelled from the Tories after voting to force the government into requesting a Brexit extension), has said that [a Conservative majority would be a ""bad outcome for the country""](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50398115). ""Leaving the implementation period on WTO terms would be devastating to many sectors of our economy. It's a thoroughly irresponsible policy."". Gauke will be standing as an independent candidate in the election.

- The **Liberal Democrats** have pledged to invest £500m per year on youth services in England to try and prevent teenagers from being drawn into violence by adopting a ""public health approach"" to knife crime. ""We are in a knife crime epidemic, but successive governments have taken the wrong approach to dealing with it,"" says Jo Swinson.

- **Boris Johnson** [visited](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-50398877) parts of the country that have been affected by recent flooding. In Stainforth, South Yorkshire, Johnson was heckled by members of the public for the Government's response to the flooding, and one person [told him](https://twitter.com/joepike/status/1194592831479963649), ""It’s took you over five days. You should have been there Saturday morning having a meeting... and I’m sorry your announcements yesterday were a pittance.""

- In Glasgow, Labour leader **Jeremy Corbyn** [is heckled](https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1194595607073185793) by a man who says, ""Do you think the man that's going to be Prime Minister of this country should be a terrorist sympathiser, Mr Corbyn?"" The man [was identified](https://twitter.com/RaynerSkyNews/status/1194645872019152896) as Rev Richard Cameron, a Church of Scotland minister, who has previously made homophobic and islamophobic comments on social media. A statement from the Church of Scotland said that they will investigate all complaints.

- In a speech, Labour's Shadow Chancellor **John McDonnell** [said that](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-labour-nhs-four-day-week-mcdonnell-ashworth-corbyn-a9201266.html) Labour's ""four-day week"" pledge would also apply to NHS staff. The Shadow Health Secretary **Jonathan Ashworth** previously said in a number of interviews that it *would not* apply to NHS staff.

- **Royal Mail** [have won](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50409317) a High Court injunction to block strikes by postal workers over the Christmas period, which also could have disrupted postal voting for the upcoming election.

- Brexit Party leader **Nigel Farage** [confirms](https://twitter.com/lewis_goodall/status/1194627469409603585) he will not stand down candidates in Tory target seats. The Brexit Party had recently stood down all candidates in 317 seats that were won by the Conservatives in the 2017 election.

- The **Bureau of Investigative Journalism** [announce](https://twitter.com/TBIJ/status/1194622823450468352) they have launched an ""urgent legal challenge"" aimed at forcing the Government to publish the report on Russian interference into elections/referendums which had been created by the UK Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee.

- The **Scottish National Party** [have launched](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-50410790) legal action against ITV, challenging their upcoming head-to-head debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. Party leader **Nicola Sturgeon** said, ""To exclude the SNP would be a fundamental breach of broadcasters' obligations to fully and properly represent and reflect the views of the whole UK.""

So given labours announcement that they will not supply a referendum vote to the SNP in their first term, hopes of any government are surely dead in the water. My gut feeling is we will be back at the polls in 6 months time just like our spanish friends.

Labour couldn't possibly run on a manifesto commitment to have another Independence referendum - they need the left-wing unionist vote."

Undertones singer takes aim at DUP’s Poots over Lough Neagh algae crisis
The Derry man has been vocal on environmental issues throughout the UK in recent years


Former DUP Agriculture minister Edwin Poots is behind a decision allowing farmers to flout pollution laws, ex-Undertones frontman Feargal Sharkey has said.
Mr Sharkey – who has in recent years campaigned for safer waterways throughout the UK – weighed in on the crisis currently affecting Lough Neagh by posting on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday morning.

The lough has been engulfed this year by cyanobacteria, known as blue-green algae. The algae can be toxic.

The situation has caused outrage, as Lough Neagh provides 40% of our drinking water.

Increased growth this year has been attributed to a “perfect storm” of warm, wet weather and increased nutrients in the water caused by various forms of pollution.

Mr Sharkey said a decision taken by Mr Poots last year had contributed to the largest freshwater lake in the UK and Ireland becoming “the largest cesspit in Europe”.

Lough Neagh and two of its tributaries see spike in pollution levels since 2021
Sharing a screenshot of a decision taken by the former DAERA minister in October 2022, Mr Sharkey highlighted a quote from Mr Poots revealing penalties for farmers who repeatedly broke the rules would be capped at 15% of government payments.

Farmers are required to keep their land in good agricultural and environmental condition (GAEC) in order to qualify for full payments under a number of government schemes.

But they can have their payments reduced for intentional or negligent breaches, with previous rules allowing deductions of up to 100%.

However, legislation that came into effect in 2022 reduced this threshold significantly.

""Under the (EU) existing arrangements, certain repeated negligent breaches can be considered intentional, attracting very high financial penalties,” Mr Poots said at the time..


""The new regime means that these repeated negligent penalties will be capped at 15%. This is a much fairer approach to our hard-working farmers.

""This is only possible because we have left the European Union and can now make decisions to suit local needs.”

Mr Sharkey said Mr Poots was “the man who changed the rules so that famers who repeatedly and negligently break pollution laws can have their fines capped at 15% of previous levels”.

It comes after DAERA figures revealed that Lough Neagh and two of its waterways have recorded the largest number of medium to high level pollution incidents over the last two years.

The data revealed 84 of the 268 high and medium level pollution incidents recorded in Northern Ireland between January 2021 and August 2023 occurred in the River Blackwater (33), Lough Neagh (30) and Lower Bann (21).

Since 2021, some 2,006 pollution incidents of all levels have been recorded across our waterways, according to the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA).

Both Edwin Poots and the DUP have been approached for comment.

>Poots was educated at the Wallace High School, Lisburn, and then studied at Greenmount Agricultural College.[7] **He is a farmer** and is married with four children.[8]

And yes it's better to avoid going through Dublin when you first immigrate so you get the proper UK stamps.,"American husband moving to NI

Hi all

Just wondering if someone has any experience, advice or information on moving my partner to the north from LA.

Quick backstory, I moved to LA 4 years ago from Belfast, partner is from California. We’ve been married for 2.5 years. 

We’re now looking to move back to NI in the next couple of months, especially since they’re granted EU status to spouses of NI residents etc.

Does anyone know if we file before entering? If so where we can find the paperwork etc? Or if we need a solicitor etc? 

We’ve been drolling the internet for answers and not finding anything direct. 

Any advice is appreciated 

Thanks!

EDIT. Should have stated that we’ve trying to speak to immigration advisors at the embassy etc to no avail, emails have been sent and those that respond have been very limited or directed to websites with limited info.

We know it’s a little grey in areas as the EU status application for spouses is still new and with Brexit on the horizon there’s limited info. 

We know it’s a long shot, but just throwing the net out on the hope that maybe someone one here sees it that’s going through it currently or has went through it.

Hi there! I'm an American who moved to NI two and a half years ago, so I might be able to help! First off, do not contact any embassy, they do not handle routine immigration application queries.

If you want to pay an immigration lawyer you can, but they are very expensive and usually not any more helpful than internet forums.

If you haven't heard of them before check out [UK Yankee](https://talk.uk-yankee.com/index.php?topic=98048.0), they're a really good resource for moving to the UK. However, you'll find that it is difficult to get northern irish-specific advice, just because there aren't many of us.

It looks like you guys want to apply under the [EU settlement status application route for 'family members of an eligible person of Northern Ireland](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families/family-member-eligible-person-from-northern-ireland)' route, right? It is a very new route that just went into law on August 24th.  So not many people have applied to this route, and there is not much advice available. I applied to switch my status from a UK spousal to this new route about 2 weeks ago, but I haven't heard back yet. It's a bit of guesswork at the moment with what documentation to submit because there are so few applicants so far. My situation is a bit different than yours though, as I am already in Northern Ireland, and I've submitted evidence of legally residing in the country. I'm really not sure what/if you need to file before entering.

A really good NI-specific resource is [Advice NI](https://www.adviceni.net/eu-settlement-scheme).  They have loads of EU Settlement information on their website, and they have a free immigration advice service where you can contact them via e-mail or phone and they will do their best to help you. They have had periodic zoom sessions with an immigration solicitor(same thing as a lawyer in the US) and I found it to be very helpful! Sadly you just missed a session that took place today! Keep checking their [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/AdviceNI) to see if they're hosting more sessions.

Hopefully that helped a bit! Feel free to DM me as well if you have any more questions or want some insight on all of the changes moving from the US to NI!

Thank you for the info! Rather not go down the solicitor route but now that I know the path has a specific name for me to google I’ll dig deep.

I’ll shoot advice NI a message, didn’t even think of them regarding immigration! Good to know! 

You’ve answered one of our questions, would coming in from Dublin benefit or not so we’ll make sure to come in via London. 

Thanks for taking the time to reply!

No problem! And yes it's better to avoid going through Dublin when you first immigrate so you get the proper UK stamps."

That's certainly a possibility, but it would still mean there is less of a deficit. There would still be one mind, but it wouldn't be as large.","How much is Wales worth?

With all this talk of Independence and Brexit and sending £350 million a week to Brussels and Single Markets, it's got me thinking (dangerous I know), how much is Wales worth?

Wales gets given £15bn of it's own money a year by Westminster to spend on whatever the Assembly is allowed to spend money on.

Is that £15bn more or less than the money that Wales would/could/should make if it were to be in charge of raising it's own funds?

Are we in fact being short changed by Westminster? Are we sending our own ""£350 million a week"" to a very bureaucratic Parliament? Or are we just a bottomless pit gobbling up all the money sent our way with no hope of a return?

Wales is heavily subsidised: [""Wales' net fiscal balance in 2014-15 was a deficit of £14.7 billion. This deficit has reduced from £15.8 billion in 2010-11.""](http://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/wgc/files/2016/04/Government-Expenditure-and-Revenue-Wales-2016.pdf) About £23billion is raised here, and £38billion spent, a deficit which is about 24% of GDP. 

Almost 40% of the deficit is spent on social protection, and the majority of that is spent of state pensions. As these funds would have been payed into the UK coffers, [it's the UK which would still have to foot the bill for these](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27309215).

The report also says that Wales spends £1.7 billion on defence every year as part of the UK, if Wales were to go to independent it's hard to imagine defence spending reaching more than a few hundred million.

Now, I'm no economist so I could be missing something, but the deficit is unlikely to be anything near as high as £15 billion.

> As these funds would have been payed into the UK coffers, it's the UK which would still have to foot the bill for these.

After all, you can't expect a foreign country to pay your pensioners after independence. If there was a Norwegian style pot, then Wales would get a population proportion of it (or contribution based, or something). 

As for defence, at the NATO 2% of GDP, that's just over a billion pounds, so that's £700million saved. Cut down to 0.55% (by far the lowest in Europe thanks to Ireland), and that's just under £300million spending on defence, so a pretty accurate estimate on your part! That's still a massive deficit though.

This should be a pretty obvious alarm bell that our current economic system is doomed to failure and in need of complete reform. We can't keep replacing our population with a new cohort of immigrants each generation, that's patently absurd. We need to make it affordable for ordinary families to have children again. Fixing the housing crisis (which massive influxes of immigrants is a big contributor to) would help to achieve this.

As an aside, the idea of ""the Great Replacement"" (the idea that white European populations at large are being demographically and culturally replaced by non-white peoples) is often derided as a far-right conspiracy theory, but isn't that exactly what's happening here? Expect the far-right to continue gaining ground all across Europe unless others across the political spectrum can acknowledge that this is exactly the system which neoliberalism has led to, and find a way to reverse those trends.

I find this really irritating, too. There seems to be an elision between

* ""The Great Replacement"". a conspiracy theory that a shadowy group of individuals and politicians are scheming to replace the ""native"" population of Europe with populations of different ethnicities, for dark and shadowy reasons, normally to do with preserving their wealth or gaining a more tractable population.

and

* The fact that the ""native"" population of Europe is, based upon current trends, being replaced by populations with different ethnicities who have higher birthrates. (And that politicians are doing little about it, or see it as necessary to maintain social security systems).

The fact that it is happening is the relevant fact, I would have thought, but when this is stated, it is often claimed as being someone voicing 1.

I actually agree and I’m leftwing as fuck. BUT who cares if we’re replaced. I really have zero understanding of why this is an issue. 

I guess this depends how nihilist you are. There's a case for saying, of course ""who cares, we'll be dead"". But then why care about anything? With that worldview, climate change hardly matters.

If you have kids (I do) and/or think that there is anything valuable about European culture worth preserving (I do) and/or think that the influx may lead to negative consequences in the medium or long term (such as societal upheaval, the upending of dearly held Enlightenment and pluralist values, and/or profoundly negative consequences for my children and their children) then it becomes something to worry about.

I care about peoples lives not some future that is as likely as Star Trek. The thing is Islamic democracies exist. The other thing is a hell of a lot of social liberalism is very very new Obama didn’t support gay marriage in 2008 for gods sake things change and people develop.

Saw the BBC article about house prices dropping. After reading the comments I decided to investigate some figures for myself
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-58206513


The median monthly pay increased in the UK in June was £1,971 (£23,652 a year). https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/earningsandemploymentfrompayasyouearnrealtimeinformationuk/july2021

The average house price in the UK in May was £255,000 (£1,000 off of a record high. June figures not released yet).
https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/housepriceindex/may2021

A bank will give out 4.5 times a salary in a mortgage. So an average person can get a mortgage of up to £106,434. This puts buying a property outside the reach of a single person, single parent, widow, etc., ... 

An average UK couple could get a mortgage of £212,868. That means a couple would need a deposit of £42,132 (16.52%) to get a mortgage. This is nearly a full years salary of both people before tax.

The above does not include stamp duty, legal fees, etc. 

How is the average person supposed to buy an average house?

Should the property market be crashed? What would the ramifications be.

The healthy way to 'crash' it would be to build lots more houses so the prices fall. To avoid this pushing people into negative equity, a bit of inflation at the same time as the housebuilding could keep nominal prices flat.

Yep. Build more homes. Build apartment blocks. Build suburban houses. Fill in the gaps, knock down bungalows and put up semi-detached. Convert offices, build on the less than green bits of the green belt. Increase density. Remove regulations, make planning lots easier and file all NIMBY objections using the David Brent / Michael Scott memo’s from head office method. 

Everything else is pissing in the wind.

Id fully support grabbing the land of all the golf courses around London and building affordable, good sized family homes. That land does nothing for nature and nothing for society, it’s only purpose being to entertain the wealthy while the rest of us crowd around in our tiny flats and houses.

Honestly, we are constantly told that there’s no money in farming. So why not just build stuff on farms? We’re conditioned to think of rolling fields as “the countryside” but a monoculture field isn’t all that ecologically valuable."

Pay them more!

All that does is shift the problem so common everyday items become expensive luxuries for the wealthy.

Maybe is because this is the real price of these everyday items. You cannot lower the prices of everyday items on the basis of low wages and exploitation.

There is no ""real"" price, there's what the market will bear.

What's your overall goal here? If it's the best possible outcome for the most people, you want the cheap prices.

If you'd rather people across the nation struggling and to be forced to eat less (either in volume or selection) so a hundred thousand people get paid better, that's pretty short-sighted and a net loss for almost everyone in the country.

My overall goal here is the be realistic. If there are not enough drivers due to lack of immigration you must make being a driver attractive instead of looking for a silly reason to try to explain the lack of people interested in being a lorry driver just because you don't want to pay more. Pay more and you will get more drivers.

If people get better paid shareholders get lower profits. That is all of it.

Or we could re-open the door to migrant workers.

""Being realistic"" doesn't mean ignoring one option because you don't like it.

> If people get better paid shareholders get lower profits. That is all of it.

Don't be inane, the cost hike will be passed on to consumers.

British people have decided they don't want European immigration. It is up to them to change their minds. But let me be clear, immigration without control is a way to tamper the labour market.

The cost is always passed to consumers in every sector. Why don't the UK lower the salaries of doctors so NHS would be cheaper to run? Why don't the UK lower the salaries of the City workers so financial services would cheaper for everyone? It won't make sense.

Why all western societies are always focusing its attention on keep wages under control and not in shareholders profits?

Offer and demand. If you don't pay the salaries that meet people expectations you won't get workers.

For a healthy and prosper capitalism we need to make sure there is a fair balance between capital and salaries in the economy.

>Why all western societies are always focusing its attention on keep wages under control and not in shareholders profits?

Because shareholder profits are more important due to corporate law and corporate structure (the board, the voting, etc). B corps are an alternative, as are nonprofits, coops, and state ownership.

Says who?  Why should shareholders not take a haircut rather than the workers?

Please reread my first sentence. The corporation has legal duties to the shareholders that entail maximizing returns where possible. That's one reason why non-conventional corporations and state ownership can be more equitable and fair to all stakeholders, not just shareholders."

There's no better option atm, is what i'm saying. i'm not saying they're a godsend.","I'm voting tory, having voted lib dem last time. Here's why. Don't downvote just because you disagree.

disclaimer: I by no means agree with all their policies, especially the surveillance/privacy invasions and restrictions on free speech, and their drug policy and cuts to education. These, however, do not outweigh the importance of not plunging us into an economic downturn. I just think the economy, and hence the material wellbeing of millions of citizens, is the most important consideration in the face of brexit. As we know, markets like certainty: imagine how they'd react if corbyn, a die hard socialist, got in: foreign investment would fall enormously. the rich would leave to evade taxes. Corporations would not invest much due to high taxes on corporations and capital gains. the economy tanks. people are unemployed. IMF bail outs. 1976. 

They respect the brexit vote. I voted remain, but the vote should be respected. A soft brexit is not really a brexit if we remain under the ECJ's jurisdiction. Triggering article 50 removes you as a signatory to the TFEU, and hence the free market. It would require some weird abstraction to describe remaining in the free market (and having to comply with all the rules that come with that, and which isn't actually as free as you think) as a brexit: if you read the TFEU, art 36 provides for free movement of goods, 45 provides for the free movement of workers art 49 for the free movement of businesses (can establish wherever), and 56 for the free movement of self employed people/ freedom to provide services. You can't just sign up to article 36 and then not the rest of the TFEU. It would require a hard brexit and then some form of negotiation. I'm not sure, legally, what a soft brexit would even be.

They want to reduce corporation tax. This is necessary as a way to offset the potential tariffs we face due to brexit. 

Labour simply don't understand economics. If anything, the blairites have it right. Last time we tried radical socialist policies the winter of discontent happened and the IMF had to bail us out.  Also, look at greece, spain and italy as evidence of why taxing the rich is nice in theory but just doesn't work and results in unemployment. 

I worked in Italy for a while. It's very hard to get a job there because of government regulations making the cost of employing someone so high, and the protections granted to them so great, that employers went to enormous lengths not to employ people. at the place I worked, staff had their contracts renewed every month as a loophole. No one there actually had any of the job security intended by the regulations, fewer people were paying tax and more people were unemployed. Simply taxing the rich doesn't work in practice, and actually hurts the poor. 

Labour will destroy the economy, increase our debt, and stifle job creation by making the cost of business too high. the cost of things will go up to the consumer, further hurting the poor. 

Labour want to reverse the cuts to capital gains tax. that means there's less incentive to invest. That means businesses in the UK have less capital to play with, and so less opportunity for growth, thus employing less people. 

The tories have done a very good job at getting the employment rate to up to one of the highest in Europe. People choose a zero hours contract over no work and welfare dependency (you can't just make them give the workers protection: The result is mass firing, every time). The italans and greeks, who have not embraced austerity, still have a terrible unemployment rate. 

It was thatcher that had to sort out the mess left by labour in 1976 by giving the unions so much power and not being able to control inflation. Far left economic policies do not work. I want a better future for our country. 

While I believe in individual freedom, and am very sympathetic to libertarianism, I can't vote lib dem. They repudiate democracy by refusing to acknowledge the brexit vote. Their economic policies are similar to labour, they want to increase tax on the rich and penalise investment via capital gains taxes. While they believe in the legalisation and regulation of the drug market, that is not a priority in relation to the economy at large, which is the single most important thing in improving quality of life. 

I want a party which will encourage businesses to operate and employ people as much as possible, and which doesn't penalise business investment in the UK. the more people employed, the more people paying tax, the hgher the revenues for the tax payer. if you reduce the corporate rate (which makes up like 6 or 7% of tax revenue IIRC) then the big multinationals might actually pay it, it may not be worth their time to operate such complicated offshore networks/ send it all to ireland. 

I know, something something tories hate the poor. That's not true. Tories want the poor to make more money so they can contribute to the economy and attain economic freedom as opposed to engendering welfare dependency. We want to help people not be dependent on the state, by encouraging businesses and keeping their operational costs down. That's how you employ more people: see scandinavia, they tax EVERYONE highly so the rich aren't unequally penalised, meanign the incentive is equalised for everyone. they have a very low corporate tax rate (apart from norway, the scandinavians get about 3% of their revenue from corporation tax) and low capital gains tax. their economies are booming. by taxing everyone's income fairly equally (anything above 1.2x average is a 60% tax rate) they aren't unfairly penalising hard workers. They then invest that money in infrastructure and education. 

the tories are a far cry from ideal, but they're the only party with any chance of creating a remotely functioning economy post brexit. I think a vote for any other party is actually very harmful for the country, and the poor especially, because they will go from earning less to earning nothing on the dole. companies don't respond to costly regulation and workers rights by just paying up. They fire people. A vote for labour is a vote for mass unemployment and resulting trouble with the IMF. Not for me. 

Bear in mind, I am a young voter. I voted lib dem last time and if i admitted I wanted to vote tory to my friends i'd be ostracised. It seems like labour's support comes from social pressure. I have not been given a good arguent to vote for them other than 'the tories hate the poor' which just isn't true. so please, do try and persuade me otherwise. Because I don't see why you'd vote anyone else at the moment if you want people to have jobs.

No, i don't agree with all the tory cuts especially to education. But again, i never said the tories are perfect. they're just the best I can hope for now. I probably won't vote tory the next election if the economy is stable. I'll vote whatever party wants to legalise drugs and roll back the prison system, which are enormous drivers of inequality. 

So you think the economy is the most important thing but vote for the party which has done untold damage to the economy?

Ok. I also don't understand why your entire post is about why you can't vote labour, I was expecting at least a bit of information about why you can't vote lib dem given the title.

I need evidence of this untold damage. can you explain how they've done untold damage to the economy since 2010? Because unemployment has falled to very low levels, the deficit has been reduced, our stock markets have done pretty well, they lifted us out of the recession (not caused by the tories as much as you'd like to blame them). what untold damage have they done? Everyone tells me they hurt the economy, but never explain how. Care to help?

You know what untold damage to the economy is? Look up 1976 when the IMF bailed out the UK because of labour's inability to control the economy. look at other european countries like italy and greeece. 

See the bottom: Their economic policies are very similar to labour's on everything. It's about the economy. I agree with them on their social policies, but the economy, and overall welfar eof people, is more important. 

Let's start with your employment argument, yes they have technically increased employment but they have done so using zero hour contracts, which aren't really a reliable form of employment for some people as they can go days, even weeks without being called in to work. 

Secondly I see plenty of evidence as to how they have damaged the economy, for example the pound now being valued 20% lower than what it was. In addition to this exports fell when they should have increased after the devaluation, which doesn't bode well, and now the effects of inflation are starting to hit everyday people, as people are now purchasing less products. 

It also makes me laugh when you say you vote Tory because you want to protect the welfare of everyone when all the Tories do is ruin it. Disabled people are dying as they lose their benefits and are unable to work. Schools are facing massive  budget cuts which is driving the quality of education down. Food bank use is at an all time high. But yes, with the Tories in power everyone's welfare is protected. /s

brexit caused the pound's devaluation directly. that was not conservative economic policy, that was the market's reaction to brexit. 

sure, blame the tories for brexit, they did grant the referendum. but it wasn't their economic policy which hurt the pound's value.

Hopefully at some point during the upcoming 10 years of a government staffed entirely by people who voted Remain, backed up by MPs who almost entirely voted Remain, and advised solely by people who all voted Remain, someone will look at the years of polling showing a pro-Remain/Rejoin majority and we'll move a smidge closer to the EU. Hopefully...

You'd never be able to rejoin on the same unique terms as before.

The damage from this can never be undone.

Arguably the UK losing the special snowflake conditions and rejoining as an equal member would be a positive step compared to pre-2016, for both the UK and the EU

It wouldn't be, because the EU is doomed to fail in its current state. Specifically because of the Euro. Quite frankly, public education about the Euro is comically bad. I'll try to redress that a little:

You can't have unified monetary policy without unified fiscal policy, and that's a massive hair in the soup absolutely nobody wants to touch with a barge pole. At the same time, it's an inevitability which is widely recognised by policy makers and academics - mechanisms designed to reconcile the two were baked into the Euro from day one. The problem is that they've never worked as intended.

The long term destiny of the bloc is going to be one of three possibilities:

a) The South/Eastern European economies within the Eurozone continue to lean heavily on Germany's (primarily) and France's solvency until some unknown point in the future where that is no longer tenable, and the entire bloc enters a financial crisis so severe that it'll make 2008 look like a funfair. Pros: We get to ideologically cling to the Euro. Cons: everything else.

b) The weakest Southern/Eastern economies will be ejected, either by force or by their own democratic mandates, from the Euro, and revert to their own currencies. Pros: Countries remaining within the Eurozone will have closer economic parity, and the monetary union could function quite smoothly. Cons: Ideologically, the continent will no longer be as unified - the Euro is the embodiment of European unity, after all.

c) Fiscal policy is centralised and federalised a la the USA, turning the EU into a true United States of Europe. Pros: Ideologically, the EU's wet dream. Cons: Economic dead zones in the EU. The problems we currently see in Spain, Italy, Greece etc. will be put on steroids. It will takes decades for these places to recover, and they may well never. 

Option c) is the most desirable for the EU as an entity, but the political appetite for this is (for obvious reasons) very low in Member States, especially those which rely on string-pulling and handy German bail-outs to function as a modern, European nation.

This EU collectively has missed fiscal centralisation targets basically non-stop since the Maastricht Treaty. [The resulting landscape has been a series of ever-more desperate bodge jobs designed to keep the system moving](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2022/number/1/article/eu-fiscal-rules-a-look-back-and-the-way-forward.html).

These bodges eventually won't do, and the bloc will have a hard decision to make. One of the above options will have to be chosen. All are uncertain, and a) is rather objectively the worst one. Nobody can predict how extensive the damage will be to the Eurozone, other than the fact that it will be severe.

When that decision is made, we will want to be as far away from the Euro as possible, as that will be inevitably an extremely turbulent time for the currency.

Completely agree - that's why I put the ""arguably"" in! I hope the situation with the Euro is a bit clearer when conversations about the UK rejoining start in a couple of decades from now."

The chaos started in 2016 with Harambe, see Trump etc in the subsequent years

I'm shocked by how passive people in this country are.

There are some pretty huge problems in this country, and our passivity is making us a punching bag of those in power.

1. Foreign investment and BTL have destroyed the housing market. Young people cannot afford a roof over their head, yet no protests on the street.
2. Wages are a joke. Nobody is earning enough. Look at comparative salaries in the US, we are earning about 50% of that.
3. Poor quality housing. Compare a UK new build to a new build anywhere in the continent - the UK one is literally made of paper, no basements, no blinds, no insulation, no standards
4. NHS doesnt exist except for in emergencies - no preventative care, only a backlog. You need private healthcare if you want any preventative care.
5. Energy costs: Ofgem should  be investigated, we are paying way too much, allowing energy companies to hide their consumer profits as ""trading"" profits
6. Immigration: We have an immigration problem. Our passivity means that we do not require immigrants to assimilate and speak english. I'm sorry but its a bare minimum to speak english and integrate yourself into the country. Programs should be run and benefits need to be contingent on successful completion of language courses, etc.

Our institutions are eroding, we are paying more tax than ever, and everyone is silent. Standards are minimal, if things stay like this I will just leave, and so will many others.

Why do we let these issues go unaddressed? Why do we settle for mediocre?

[https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC@WEO/GBR/DEU/FRA](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC@WEO/GBR/DEU/FRA)

We and other large European economies have been broadly flat for about 17 years. Germany has had some growth. But over all its been weak. UK specifically has a major lack of productivity growth. 

OBR shows the huge rise in costs of pensions

[https://obr.uk/forecasts-in-depth/tax-by-tax-spend-by-spend/welfare-spending-pensioner-benefits](https://obr.uk/forecasts-in-depth/tax-by-tax-spend-by-spend/welfare-spending-pensioner-benefits)

They jumped from £58 billion in 07-08 to about £153 billion this year. 

We have become caught in the cycles of reactionary short term emotive politics on issues like Brexit and the culture wars. Some of this is likely down to the polarisation from the internet that has been widely documented. Part of it may be down to a sort of sense of a shrinking pie making people far more self seeking and reactionary than broad minded and willing to compromise. 

There will likely be many other factors. In terms of housing specifically planning is very hard to get and people tend to NIMBY hard. Same with national scale infrastructure. 

We no longer trust the experts and always seem to cherry pick evidence for emotional validation. 

Until we recognise our problems are on the biggest scale of national orginisation and shared across much of western Europe, then admit our way of engaging is too polarised and emotive and not enough seeking compromise and context, we are headed towards middle income country politics and middle income country economics. Though it will be decades in the unwinding.

>They(pensions) jumped from £58 billion in 07-08 to about £153 billion this year. 

£92bn was inherited in [fy 2019/20](https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/average-inheritance-and-inheritance-tax-uk) by the half of estates that reported to HMRC, I think that death tax should be levied on all inheritance, this would be incredibly unpopular.

Edit:(fixing link)also: After people retire their estates go up in value by about £3k per year, after inflation.

death tax should not be a thing. Its wild to want to rob what the dead have worked for. We aren't talking about all the wealthy people who will be affected, we're talking about robbing working people. This crabs in a bicket mentality is one of the biggest reasons the UK is failing.

People don't work for rising house prices. It just happens automatically without any effort on their part. Why not tax it when they die?

The genuinely poor don't own anything so inheritance tax wouldn't affect them anyway.

I'd rather we just tax houses all along. We kind of do, with council tax, but that needs lots of revision.

Better IMO to tax land according to usage, not the buildings on that land. This would essentially make us all rent houses from the government (a big and painful change), but the end result should be a lot fairer.

I actually don't like this very much as it very much prohibits the idea of retiring in a nice house. Depending on how long you live without an income, it incentivises living with a worse quality of life in your senior years, which feels irritating."

I have been living in the UK for almost 18 years as an immigrant. I find UK quite safe in general. I have mostly lived in Oxford, Cheltenham, Coventry, Birmingham and London. I haven't had any issue living in the UK.

Lately I have come across a lot of people complaining about the safety in the UK, I am not sure how to make of their comments, are they hyperbole or I have been living in my own bubble?

Comments like:

"" No matter if its a small town or a big city im always on the lookout in the UK. ""

""I agree with your assessment of freedom. I come from London which is one of the most crime ridden city’s in the western world right now. So to be able to walk the streets without fear and for me to not have to worry every time my son and wife leave the house is a feeling I will never take for granted. Never once in 3 1/2 years of living in Shanghai have I felt unsafe. I’d be lucky to go 3 1/2 days in London""  


On the scale of safety the UK is towards the top end.

[https://www.visionofhumanity.org/maps/#/](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/maps/#/). 37th According to that.

There's a gap between how safe people are and how safe you actually are and social media plays a large part in that, as does the media (looking at you daily mail). 

Generally, you're safe most everywhere. Wouldn't walk through a dark park at night, general awareness of your surroundings is still smart as in any country.

The draconian laws against self-defense contribute a lot to that too.

We're allowed to use self defence though.

Assuming you are physically capable. If not and you dare to carry something you risk a harsher sentence than an attacker would.

Where the fuck do you live? Mordor?

Well the point they are making is actually a very reasonable one, albeit they aren't getting to it directly.

We're allowed to use self defence, but we aren't allowed to carry pepper spray.

Therefore, when it *actually* comes down to having to defend oneself, the petite 5""4 woman with nothing in her handbag gets to invoke her theoretical right to self defence, when in reality it means nothing because it is still illegal for her to be able to *practically* defend herself. Same for disabled people, and below-average strength men. 

In the UK the laws for self defence only apply equally on paper, in reality there are a few strong people and those trained in self defense, and then a large body of people who realistically will be unable to defend themselves if - god forbid - the moment arises.

Do you think allowing the British public to arm themselves would lead to to more violent crime or less?"

I wonder if the Conservatives will call a VoNC in the speaker just before the election.  That way, with the precedence in place, they would have a Conservative speaker in place for the Labour government.

Labour wouldn't want one of their first acts to be seen as political sniping so would probably have to tolerate them for a while.

Hang on, post election, we could in theory have a Lib Dem or (less likely) SNP speaker. That would be fun.

Ed Davey gets in and immediately reverses the ban on props.

If Brexit has “completely failed”, then surely someone like Farage would be completely ignored by the vast majority of the electorate. And yet numerous commentators are making him out to be an electoral threat to the Tories.

Quite a few people who aren't satisfied with it still believe in brexit, they just want the reduced immigration that was promised.  

I was surprised how many said it had been an economic flop.

If we joined the EU and had full freedom of movement, but massively cut back on non-eu immigration, we’d have a lot less net immigration, and save a lot of money on complex visa schemes and get massive efficiency gains in not having to manage soviet style centrally-planned ‘shortage lists’ per industry.

A video conference call will be held between Liz Truss, international trade secretary, and Robert Lighthizer, US trade representative.

The first round of negotiations will last for two weeks and will involve 200 officials. Future talks will take place every six weeks, according to officials.

The ability for the UK to strike trade deals with individual countries has always been seen as a major prize by the Eurosceptic politicians who led the campaign to leave the European Union in 2016.

The Department for International Trade has suggested that a successful deal with Washington could eventually boost the UK economy by £15bn a year.

The department says its analysis suggests that an FTA would benefit every region and nation of the UK with the greatest benefits in Scotland, the midlands and north-east.

However, the government has previously said that such a US deal could boost GDP between 0.07 per cent and 0.16 per cent, prompting claims from some trade experts that the net effect would be negligible compared to the loss of trade resulting from leaving the EU’s single market and customs union.

A cross-Whitehall study conducted in 2018 suggested that growth would be reduced by 2 to 8 per cent in the same period as a result of Brexit.

The UK talks will be led by Oliver Griffiths, director of US negotiations at the DIT, and overseen by Crawford Falconer, chief trade negotiation adviser for the department.

Ms Truss said she would “drive a hard bargain” to secure a deal that benefited the UK and help the economy bounce back from the economic challenges posed by Covid-19.

“We want to strike an ambitious deal that opens up new opportunities for our businesses, brings in more investment and creates better jobs for people across the whole of the country,” she said.

Washington is expected to demand a relaxation on some regulations in agribusiness, such as allowing imports of chlorinated chicken, which could prove politically unpalatable. Ms Truss has previously said that maintaining food standards is a “red line” for the UK.

Donald Trump, US president, initially said that access to the National Health Service would be “on the table” during the talks, only to distance himself from those comments a few months later.

In early March, the UK government released its negotiating objectives document in which it said that boosting trade for small and medium companies was a priority.

Although the primary focus is on goods, the UK is hopeful of boosting trade in digital services. The UK also hopes to secure an early deal on financial services and will run talks in parallel on improving ties between the City of London and Wall Street.

Scottish whisky industry is going to be thrown under the bus, I can already see it. America is already tariffing our exports by 25% because bourbon is shit and people would rather buy our single malts.

And yet far more bourbon is exported than is single malt. Almost as if you're a blinkered, xenophobic nationalist..."

>Am told Speaker's decision today was motivated by desire to protect MPs from threats by offering range ceasefire amendments - attempting to diffuse v hostile debate 

>Understand MPs went to him with concerns in the lead up to vote due to threats to themselves, families, staff

I've got to say, not having watched this live (I was in the pub after work!) it's very opaque what the complaint of the SNP is at all.

Please can someone clarify? Is it just that the speaker selected an opposition amendment (from one party) to an opposition day motion (from another) to be voted on? Why's that a problem?

So for opposition days, Labour get 17, and the SNP get 3. The convention is that when it's your turn, you get the motion, and then the govt will respond. 

Today was a day for the SNP, they opted to talk about Gaza. But then the speaker picked Labour to go first, and the Tories second, which meant that the SNP motion wouldn't be heard because one of the other two would already be passed (and then you stop voting, once something has won). 

This is against all convention and practice. The only similar things from the past 25 years (according to the senior clerk) is when the Govt haven't put up an amendment, so it would be Largest opposition vs 2nd Largest opposition type thing. 

The SNP are miffed because they see it as the rules being broken to save face for Starmer who might have had a rebellion on his hands if the normal rules had been followed. They are annoyed because they feel that the Labour amendment which was passed was not as strong as their own.

I don't get it, looking at the record the SNP motion *was* voted on and passed (without the need for division) with the Labour amendment to it also passed, so what's the problem?

Why shouldn't opposition parties be able to offer amendments to be voted on to one another's motions, why's that important? Not being obtuse, I just don't get why only the govt should be able to have amendments selected to be voted on?

The SNP motion was not voted on, neither was the Labour one. The Labour amendment to the motion (that removed every single word of the original motion to replace it with their own words) was accepted without a division. Westminster isn't a modern Parliament where all amendments can be voted on, like in the devolved Parliaments.

> Why shouldn't opposition parties be able to offer amendments to be voted on to one another's motions, why's that important? 

No one is saying this. The argument is about the order in which they are called. Usually on opposition day debates, the opposition motion will fail, then the govt amendment will pass, because the govt usually wins most votes... It was the SNP's debate today, so they should have gone first. All parties should be free to put forward motions, and of course they should, so that people can see where the common ground is, and the whips can horse trade, etc. 

The breakdown today was twofold - first of all, Labour and the LDs said they had reached out to the SNP whips, and the SNP chief whip said they were both lying. None of us can say which is true. Secondly, the Speaker used his Authority to break all convention on the order, to allow Labour to go first. This is extremely unusual, and the senior Clerk could not find a direct precedence for this. This meant that the SNP motion would never be heard/moved/voted on. 

I don't think it'll be the end of the story, tbh. Plenty of members are going to be angry at the Speaker abusing his powers, breaking conventions, and showing bias. He's already apologised, but personally for me, his statement raises more questions.

>The SNP motion was not voted on, neither was the Labour one.

The Labour one was voted on; I watched them do an assessment of the ayes and the nays within the chamber. It wasn't necessary to go to divisions for it.

Lol that's extremely pedantic.

If I am honest I don't like the idea of a de factor ref at the next GE as it conflates two different things:

1. Which MP candidate do you feel can best represent your interests? And
1. Constitutional change

They simply are not the same thing. At all.

That said, if the SNP go down this route their manifesto will be barely one sentence and their answer to any question will also be the same, because if they say anything directly about schools, environment, transport or whatever then they are beginning to mix in things that are *not* Independence.

* What will the SNP do about the crumbling road infrastructure?
* *We will deliver independence for Scotland*
* How does the SNP respond to criticism over the ferries?
* *We will deliver independence for Scotland*
* How will you improve the Scottish NHS
* *We will deliver independence for Scotland*

Now there are some.questions where that is a perfectly viable answer as the matter is currently reserved (drugs policy is one that comes to mind). But so what?

Even if they get a independence supporting majority, then what? Holyrood lacks the legal power to enact independence, they going to UDI? Crazy talk.

At best all it does is create noise in Westminster, noise that will be ignored by Labour with their **massive** majority, and noise that could push them to reconsider devolution.

I get what they are trying to do and I get that there is currently little other choice, but that does not mean I like this approach.

If it were me, I'd be doing more and more to represent Scotland as a separate entity on the world stage. Not only does that gain allies and bring pressure to bear on Westminster, but it avoids conflating two very different things.

I don't really love the idea, but most of this is why I'd prefer a GE referendum to a SG one.

I do wonder how long the ECHR will survive at this point. Seemed mad to leave at first but it certainly seems to be becoming more likely as time goes by especially as there seems to be no chance of reform.

The ECHR ruled on the full legalization of homosexuality in England & Wales (A.D.T. v United Kingdom), the full legalization of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (Dudgeon v United Kingdom), equal ages of consent (Sutherland v United Kingdom), recognition of transgender people (Goodwin v United Kingdom) and the right of  gay people to serve openly in the military (Smith and Grady v United Kingdom). Imagine what a United Kingdom without the ECHR pressuring the government would look like and you have your answer as to why it exists and why it should continue to exist.  

More broadly speaking the idea of an all powerful parliament where getting 51%+ of the seats (not even 51+% of the votes, usually less) gives you essentially unlimited and unchecked power is absurd and leads us down the path of five year elected dictatorships. Having courts that can prevent the government absolutely ramshackling over the citizenry at will is in fact a good thing and one of the few things the United States did right. It is not ""anti-democratic"" to not let the government run wild as de facto dictator for five years as the majority of democracies do not allow this. You should be very wary of the man that says ""my government is supposed to have absolute unchecked power"", especially if we're talking about relics of the past and the ironic justification for this is something from 300-500 years ago.

# What is the EU Copyright Directive?

The Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market 2016/0280(COD) is a proposed European Union directive with the stated goal to harmonise aspects of copyright law in the Digital Single Market of the European Union. It is an attempt to adjust copyright law for the Internet by providing additional protection to rightsholders. The proposal was approved by the European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs and eventually accepted by the parliament after initially voting against it. This is not the final vote on the issue however - the Parliament will get another vote before May 2019.


You can read the full proposal [here](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016PC0593). It is the proposal by the Commission and [this](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CONSIL:ST_9134_2018_INIT&from=EN) is the proposal the Council agreed on.

# Why is it controversial?

Two articles stirred up some controversy:

## Article 11

This article is meant to extend provisions that so far exist to protect creatives to news publishers. Under the proposal, using a 'snippet' with headline, thumbnail picture and short excerpt would require a (paid) license - as would media monitoring services, fact-checking services and bloggers. This is directed at Google and Facebook which are generating a lot of traffic with these links ""for free"". It is very likely that Reddit would be affected by this, however it is unclear to which extent since Reddit does not have a European legal entity. Some people fear that it could lead to European courts ordering the European ISPs to block Reddit just like they are doing with ThePirateBay in several EU member states.


## Article 13

This article says that Internet platforms hosting “large amounts” of user-uploaded content should take measures, such as the use of ""effective content recognition technologies"", to prevent copyright infringement. Those technologies should be ""appropriate and proportionate"".

Activists fear that these content recognition technologies, which they dub ""censorship machines"", will often overshoot and automatically remove lawful adaptations such as memes (oh no, not the memes!), limit freedom of speech, and will create extra barriers for start-ups using user-uploaded content.

## Amendments

After the JURI proposal failed in the parliament on July 5, the proposal was amended by multiple sides. Some of those amendments tried to adress the issues brought up in regards to Art. 11&13. People opposed to parts of the proposal state that they consider these changes mostly cosmetic though.


# The trilogue 

## What's a trilogue?

Trilogue negotiations are provided for in EU treaties. They are used if the Council of the European Union does not agree to the amendments proposed by the European Parliament at the second reading. In this case, formal trilogue negotiations are carried out within the framework of a conciliation committee. A trilogue is understood as an equally composite tripartite meeting between those involved in the legislative process of the EU institutions. These bodies are the European Commission (EC), the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. The European Commission takes on the mediating function.

## The status quo

Until very recently, the council could not find a joint position on the issue of the copyright reform. However, a French-German compromise managed to win the support of a majority on February 8, being accepted with 20 votes in favour, 7 against and one abstention (Poland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg, Malta, Finland, and Slovakia). 

## The compromise

The compromise consists of some modifications for Art. 13:

*All profit-oriented platforms need to implement upload filters unless they:*

* *Are younger than three years* and
* *Have an annual revenue of 10 Million Euros or less* and
* *Have less than five million users per month* and
* *Have seriously attempted to acquire the necessary licenses*


This deal was criticized by activists, saying that upload filters are bad and have to go completely, by the rappoteur of the EU parliament Axel Voss, who insists that these excpetions are too wide-ranging and by the industry set to profit from these filters. 

## The Trilogue negotiations

The trilogue negotiations are currently ongoing. 

# Timetable

* **June 20** (passed): Vote of the Legal council
* **July 5** (rejected): Parliament votes on the negotiation mandate
* **July-September**: Possible amendments and changes to the proposal

What do think? Do you find the proposals balanced and needed or are they rather excessive? Did you call an MEP and how did it go? Are you familiar with EU law and want to share your expert opinion? Did we get something wrong in this post? Leave your comments below!



This is going to be a shitshow of epochal proportions if it passes. 

Even if our govenment wanted to comply with this (and they don't, it'd kill their electoral platforms) there's no way a law forcing the implementation of an automated upload filter can be made compliant with the italian constitution when article 21 expressly forbids subjecting the press to authorizations and censorships and states that seizure can only be issued by judicial autorities and i'm willing to bet Italy isn't the only country where laws concerning freedom of press would enter in conflict with article 11 and 13.

Why are you talking about an automated upload filter? There is no automated upload filter in this Directive. None of the local laws anywhere in the EU conflict with Article 11 and 13 in their current form.

That's literally article 13.
>This article says that Internet platforms hosting “large amounts” of user-uploaded content should take measures, such as the use of ""effective content recognition technologies"", to prevent copyright infringement. 

Unless you're saying that the op is wrong, in which case provide an explantation. 

That's literally not in Article 13, I am saying OP is wrong. Here is Article 13 in its current form:

""Article 13

Use of protected content by information society service providers storing and giving access to works and other subject-matter

	
1.  Where information society service providers offer users content storage services and provide the public with access to content and where such activity is not eligible for the liability exemptions provided for in Directive 2000/31/EC, they shall take appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure the functioning of licensing agreements concluded with rightholders. The implementation of such agreements shall respect the fundamental rights of users and shall not impose a general obligation on information society service providers to monitor the information which they transmit or store, in accordance with Article 15 of Directive 2000/31/EC.

1a.  For the purpose of ensuring the functioning of licensing agreements, as referred to in paragraph 1, information society service providers and rightholders shall cooperate with each other. Rightholders shall accurately identify to information society service providers the works or other subject-matter in respect of which they have the copyright. The information society service providers shall inform rightholders of the measures employed and the accuracy of their functioning as well as, when relevant, periodically report on the use of the works and other subject-matter.

	
2.  Member States shall ensure that the service providers referred to in paragraph 1 in cooperation with rightholders put in place complaints mechanisms that are available to users in case of disputes over the implementation of the licensing agreements referred to in paragraph 1.

2a.  Member States shall ensure that users have access to a court or another competent authority for the purpose of asserting their right of use under an exception or limitation and to appeal any restrictive measures agreed upon pursuant to paragraph 3.

3.  Member States shall facilitate, where appropriate, the cooperation between the information society service providers referred to in paragraph 1, user representatives and rightholders through stakeholder dialogues to define best practices for the implementation of paragraph 1. The measures undertaken shall be appropriate and proportionate and shall take into account, among others, the nature of the services, the availability of the technologies and their effectiveness in light of technological developments.

3a.  Hyperlinking to already publicly available content shall not constitute communication to the public of the source of that content, where the hyperlink only contains information necessary to find or request the source's contents.""

Can you see what I see, namely that it's not there?

>appropriate and proportionate measures

Why are you so sure this won't refer to automated solutions?

The question is why people think it can only refer to automated solutions.

I mean Dominic Raab only figured out we’re an Island 6 months ago. That is the level we’re working at.

We're not an Island, we're a group of islands

A group of Islands covering disputed territory.

... What territory is disputed? The only thing I can think of is NI which is not formally disputed anymore since the GFA.

It is disputed. The GFA froze the conflict, but did not end it. The EU made it so that you could pretend it wasn't there.

Disputed territory refers to territory disputed between countries. As part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Republic of Ireland removed their claim to Northern Ireland from their constitution - therefore it is no longer counted as disputed territory.

You are right: it's not disputed between states. Irish nationalises still have the goal of a united island, but through a referendum. As per the GFA.

But the thing is this, the moment the GFA falls, NI becomes disputed territory. Thus, it's a freeze, not a finished affair.

> But the thing is this, the moment the GFA falls, NI becomes disputed territory.

Only if the Republic of Ireland adds the claim back into their constitution, which they would have to do through a referendum. Whilst that is entirely possible, I'm not sure how likely it is - as they wouldn't want us to rip up the other parts of the treaty; such as the part promising self-determination.

It's an interesting point of pedantry whether disputed territories are necessarily so between states.

From the Guardian's liveblog; Tom Tugendhat talking about our ""woke"" military: 

>You know, the British armed forces have one purpose and one purpose alone, and that’s to defend the British people and *bring death to the king’s enemies*. 

Why are our ministers so weird - why can't they be normal? He was supposed to be one of the sensible ones.

see fundamentally he's wrong to say that the armed forces have one purpose and one purpose alone, not least because he's named two purposes right there.

**Two purposes** - to defend the British people, bring death to the king’s enemies and look very snazzy in their uniforms.

Three purposes. to defend the British people, bring death to the king’s enemies, and look very snazzy in their uniforms.

ukpolitics,comment,UKIP,ixi41jr,Xezshibole,,"This is an opportune time to take it and not suffer effects of walling off England, all due to one key reason.

UK, and definitely England, cannot and will not properly check Single Market goods well into the foreseeable future. It's waving in SM goods as if it were still in SM, largely because checks cause delays, lowering trade flow. It's the flow of goods, most prominently food. In short, properly implementing the checks would trigger an immediate food shortage, hence the government preferring this even as opening UK market to near seamless EU flow while not getting it reciprocated is deeply disadvantageous to UK businesses.

Scotland in contrast has pledged to rejoin the full EU. Though that may or may not be quick, rejoining the Single Market and Customs Union is definitely quicker and a prerequisite to the EU anyways.

When Scotland rejoins SM and sets up a hard border between the two, England is forced to wave in Scottish goods as it is doing with other Single Market members or discriminate against a SM member. And we all saw how the EU reacted to that during the Trump trade wars. Meaning Scotland keeps most if not all its market share in England as SM and Northern Ireland have.

Meanwhile Scotland walls off English exports into Scotland, substituting it with SM/NI/Scottish goods just as Northern Ireland has done.

In exchange for all of this, Scotland regains *seamless* access to a 460 million sized market.

For the record Northern Ireland is the best performing region in the UK right now, with a nonfunctioning government to boot. They manage this precisely because the SM is so important to the economy, they maintain most of their pre-Brexit market share in England as SM has done, and there's so much former UK market share in SM, NI, and now Scotland to expand into.

The best bit about the next Scots independence referendum campaign will be watching politicians of all sides having to argue against their own words from the Brexit campaign.

I often see this comparison being made but it rings incredibly hollow. Do people genuinely not see the difference?

Of course there are differences, but that doesn't mean that pro-indy politicians won't be asked about their previous statements on why enacting hard border with your biggest trade partner is a bad idea, or pro-union asked why Scotland can't take advantage of the sunlit uplands if the UK could.

Hello there

So I’ve been talking to quite a few people who migrated to Scotland after living in different countries.

The phrases, 
“I feel like this is home”
“People make you feel welcome here”
“I love this place” were repeated over and over.
It almost sounds surreal. But very much genuine.

I’ve heard this over and over from multiple people of different ethnical backgrounds, and am just curious to ask..

In this day and age, with the current political climate in the world, how come Scotland is so positively different in it’s attitudes towards immigrants?

Cause we're no cunts

I am. I'm.just no a nasty cunt.

Could be a sound cunt as well tbf, or just an alright cunt

Hey, guys i was lately I was wondering about Brexit and an idea had started to emerge: The British voted for the UK to leave the EU, so would it not be funny that the UK actually leave the EU but keeps the 4 freedoms, stays in the single market and relinquishes any power on EU policy because they would have no vote. It would be  interesting to see the Brexiters to congratulate themselves for  leaving the EU with no economic impact, no?

i hope the uk gets shafted with the biggest, hardest, cringiest possible brexit.

Author makes no attempt to address the quesetion of our very low fertility rate. If our fertility rate isn't able to maintain the population, we need mass migration to make up the shortfall.

The author needs to mention that the older generations, everyone from boomer to gen x have taken on a vast sum of debt with the expectation every subsequent generation millennial + will pay it back?

Also, a bunch of people who don't work and are retiring soon decided how the people who have to work to pay off the debt, how they should work (Brexit), after benefiting from the arrangement for so many years.

Then the old people decided to change the planning system, into a restrictive process, which like Diamond company ""De Beers"" does with restricting diamonds on the market to keep the price artificially high, they have done to the housing market to keep their investments and assets high.

The same old people encouraged each other to buy existing stock and rent to the young people to ensure none of them could get on the housing market and start a family. Furthermore they backed all the pensions against the inflated property market, so to release the planning restrictions would give an immediate house market crash and destroy quite a few pension funds.

And whilst we are in the subject of pensions. These old people from boomers to gen X decided to give themselves all massive final salary pensions and brilliant agreements which will never be replicated or are sustainable. So ontop of taking out a mountain of debt, removing market opportunity and being a big enough generation to exploit a flaw in democracy, we have to pay their unsustainable pensions too.

And this is without me mentioning COVID and the fact it only affected the old, but made everyone lock down regardless, even though we should of just shielded boomers and gen x and carried on as normal.

This is conspiracy theory nonsense. ""Old people"" are just young people that aged so they had as much power in the country as you do right now, and there were no grand meetings where they twirled their moustaches and decided to club together to buy up houses.

A big reason why BTL took off is that pension funds were being robbed and to add insult to injury then New Labour stuck their hand in them and took billions out of people's funds (which we all still pay on our savings today). There wasn't protection for pensions in that era so a minority of people started looking for safe options away from the City spivs and bricks and mortar was it, although the City copped on and then started doling out mortgages for it thus fuelling it. Most older people are not landlords at all.

Your comments on pensions are ignorant too as millions of old people don't have final salary pensions at all. Again just like today, there are some people that are on good earnings/package and a load that are not. Sweeping generalisations are bollocks.

As to covid; the overwhelming crowd opinion on this very site was lockdown and demands for harsher and longer ones and it is a site of the young. The minority arguing against it where shouted down and the mods went after them with bans and hounding. Often it was older people who've seen media drama many times playing out and who knew what it was doing to the nations finances who were the sceptics.

I don't do conspiracy I follow the money as this reveals all.

Now let's just take the mountain of debt as exhibit A, and the need for it to exist in the first place? It is a vast sum of cash which isn't justifiable and the expectation the young are meant to pay it off?

Following your mountain of debt, I didn't vote new labour in, nothing to do with me, I wasn't eligible to have a say, so your entire comment is an excuse for overspending? Why not endorse fiscal responsibility from the off and maybe you didn't have to steal from each other to pay the bills?

Furthermore you expect the young to pay it off? So once you justified the vast sum of debt as being ""life"". How do you explain isolationist economic decisions like brexit, which hampen economic growth to repay the monies? 

Your entire comment is based around you not being ""one of those who benefited"" and thus voiding all accountability for what has happened at all? 

Also, on the note of COVID, the overwhelming crowd opinion to lock down from whom? The old people that out number the young you mean because of number demographics? The same old people who swung the Brexit vote and your ""new labour?"" Due to number superiority?

I work in construction and we neither locked down or stopped working. Everyone under 40 at the time should of kept going, whilst you lot stayed at home, I actually remember working through lockdown, everything ran smoother, from liasing with local authorities to coordinating with statutory undertakers regarding services. In fact if the lockdown continued we could of smashed out hs2, which we did due to majority of your age group cowering at home.

Except you aren't as explained in my previous reply. And you are making statements and sticking a question mark on the end, and that is really weird.

An aggressive question is still a question regardless in your opinion on how assertive it is phrased. It's not weird, the fact you seem to think young people should put up with this with no accountability from the older generations is weird.

So in my first post I debunked your ideas so you can back with a gish gallop (in which each point is a rehash of the false claims I rebutted) and that is based on the false premise that older people are a cohesive group as you need that to be able to hand a second false premise of ""no accountability"" - it is meaningless even if you exclude how flawed it is.

You didn't debunk anything. I never said it was plotted, it the result of demographics favouring the old and gross incompetence from the community. Furthermore a cultural feeling not to control expenditure.

The young should not be forced to pay back the debts of the old. If we must we can sacrifice the money allocated for pensions to do it.

Your view of debt is rather strange. The hospitals, schools, train lines and just about any infrastructure and so on that the young inherited are all funded by debt along with the covid support that kept the UK's economy functional. Something like half of young people aren't paying enough taxes to pay for the services that they need to hand (NHS, police, fire, courts, prisons). Each generation passes on debt to the next whether it is WW2 or building nuclear power or covid or Uni fees, and the young are doing the same as the costs of the things I listed plus net zero are being done in their time.

You seem to have this rage against the old, but are unable to make an argument that stands up to even basic scrutiny.

Half of young people aren't paying enough taxes??

The Tories are going to continue to fall over the next half year.  Both covid-19 and brexit will see to that.

The question is how much will much of it will stick by the time of the next GE?   The government right now is building a reputation for incompetence.  So if that stays I strongly suspect the next GE will be a horror show for them.

My prediction is that they'll foist the bulk of the blame onto Boris, get rid of him and slide Gove in, saying, 'well, now everything will be wonderful, vote for us, or terrible things will happen to you under the monsters of the opposition!'.

There also needs to be a major discussion about the question used. The remain/leave question gets much more union support than the yes/no question. We need to explore why this is.

This will be another “once in a lifetime” referendum. 

And if the people vote incorrectly- it will be an annual event.

We’ve had 3 general elections since the last Scottish Referendum vote. Why should this political decision be “once in a lifetime”? People’s opinions and situations change and promises made weren’t kept.

Would there then be a referendum to rejoin after the next 3 election cycles?  Or is ‘leave’ the only definitive answer, and ‘remain’ is just a temporary answer that will require a further referendum in the future?

If a party makes rejoining a central part of their manifesto and then wins a general election with 45+% of the vote then yeah another referendum would make sense.

Democracy is a process not an event."

The only way that Plaid will get a foothold in the Valleys is if Labour don't move beyond a policy of managed decline.","Why has Plaid Cymru failed to emulate what the SNP did in Scotland?

I was mostly on social media during the duration of the election campaign and I was seeing everywhere people saying they were gonna switch to Plaid as 'Wales has been let down by Westminster'.

Seen this rhetoric quite often, which reminds me of Scotland. And then a couple opinion polls showed Plaid scooping up a couple of gains and its vote share going up. As a party offering a referendum on Welsh Independence it's quite significant for that sort of movement in their direction.

So come election day not only did Welsh Labour more than hold off against the Tories, they took Leanne Wood's seat, Plaid themselves saw their vote collapse in quite a few seats, and ultimately they saw a fall in their vote share. 

This despite Labour being in power for 22 years and arguably Adam Price having his greatest shot at emulating the SNP on the backbone of COVID showing devolution in the spotlight, disillusionment with Boris Johnson (to an extent) and also Brexit, although I doubt that had much of an effect here in Wales considering we're a leave voting part of the UK.

Yet clearly there's no disillusionment with Labour despite its two decades in office, there's no appetite (from the results at least) for Independence and Wales just seems to be a complete contrast to Scotland.

Why do you think Plaid has yet, if ever, to make SNP-like breakthroughs, and do you think it'll even ever be possible for them to do so?

The Welsh language. Simple as that. And so long as plaid keep denying that’s the problem the longer it will continue.

The obsession with the language above all else allows Labour to pick up all average Welsh person for whom the language is not part of their national identity.

What would you have Plaid Cymru do differently with respect to the Welsh language? 

I ask cos I don't recall Welsh coming up a lot during the campaign (except when abolish said they'd scrap the 'million speakers' policy and default bilingualism) and Plaid's policies aren't that different to Labour's and certainly don't elevate it to the level of obsession?

Maybe having some non-Welsh speaking politicians who don’t feel the need to learn it. And where in power give people access to education in the language of their choice.

Seems kind of unfair to class ""being able to or learning to speak welsh"" as being obsessed with the language.

Isn't the power to access education in the language of the services user's choice legally written into Welsh law via the Welsh Language Act?  

I know there was a fuss a couple of years back cos a village primary school was switching from english-medium to welsh, but those who wanted to continue in English medium education had the option of going to a school in the next village.  Is there anywhere in Wales where English-medium education is not available? 

(I know Cymdeithas yr Iaith and other groups like the IWA argue that all schools should be welsh medium, but AFAI that's not policy or practice anywhere).

like not trying to be a dick but i can't understand why a politician wanting to or being able to speak both of the official languages of the country they represent could ever be a negative.

or rather i can, and i do understand why non-welsh speaking welsh people feel hostile to the language and i think that hostility ultimately comes from feelings of inadequacy or maybe even shame about not being able to speak welsh.

and like not judging anyone for those feelings of inadequacy but also it's not the welsh speaker or learner's fault that people feel that way and i think we should be more honest about issues of alienation from national identity in non-welsh speaking wales.

Plenty of places in west Wales where parents can’t access English education. It’s a rather big thing if you ask any politician about it.

Non-Welsh speaking people don’t feel inadequate. That attitude is part of the problem. There seems to be a view which Plaid typifies that the Welsh language is essential to Welshness. They don’t understand that to the majority of Welsh people it isn’t important. That doesn’t mean that those people are anti-Welsh language at all, it is simply not part of their identity and oppose the attitude of Plaid and that community (the Welsh language society being an example) that not speaking Welsh should be considered a disadvantage and be used to discriminate against them in their career.

You're certainly right as things stand - a legacy of the Blue Books. But that attitde will go out of fashion in a couple of decades' time as the language is embedded through school education and adult learning. It will cease to be the divisive issue it has been since the late sixties/early seventies.

I think it can quite insidiously sanitise some of these people to reduce them to being just a ""celeb"".

I don't really think politicians should fit into the category anyway, but at least when someone like Dorries was on it, she was a) a nonentity at the time (and arguably always has been), and b) wasn't carrying anywhere near the level of baggage she is now.

I'm no fan of Farage and my usual approach to this sort of TV is simply to not care about it, but I was genuinely angry when they announced Matt Hancock was going to be on it.

He's not a ""celeb"", he's a member of government who was directly responsible for health decisions and strategies during a time of national crisis. His arrogance, ineptitude and recklessness got people killed. Yes, they don't make him look good, and when he's on this and other things like the SAS show, they make him look like a joke, but he's not a joke, because jokes are funny. There is nothing funny about the misery Hancock is responsible for.

Reminds me of back before Brexit when Farage and Boris were really common on the Panel Show circuit. It massively popularised them and gave them a huge audience to present themselves as ""Normal blokes"". 

I genuinely don't think Brexit would have happened if shows like Mock the Week hadn't have platformed these two so aggressively in those preceding years.

Neither of those guys showed up on mock the week, they would have been slaughtered.

>Lawmakers have put forward nine proposals for Monday, most of which are the same or similar to last week’s, and Bercow will announce mid-afternoon which will be has chosen to be voted on.

>Below are the options which have been put forward:

>**A) Unilateral right of exit from backstop - John Baron**

>Calls for Britain to leave the EU on May 22 with Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement amended so that Britain could unilaterally exit the Northern Irish backstop.

>The same proposal from Baron was not selected for a vote last week.

>**B) No deal in the absence of a Withdrawal Agreement - John Baron**

>Calls for Britain to leave the EU without a deal on April 12, if parliament cannot approve a Withdrawal Agreement.

>An almost identical proposal from Baron last week was rejected by 400 votes to 160.

>**C) Customs Union - Kenneth Clarke**

>Calls on the government to ensure any Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration negotiated with the EU includes a commitment to negotiate a permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union, and to enshrine this aim in law.

>The same proposal from Clarke last week was rejected by just 6 votes, with 265 lawmakers supporting it and 271 opposing it.

>**D) Common Market 2.0 - Nick Boles**

>Calls for an enhanced Norway-style deal which would include membership of the EU’s single market as well as a customs arrangement with the EU.

>While Boles has tweaked some of the detail, a broadly similar proposal he put forward last week was supported by 189 lawmakers and opposed by 283.

>**E) Confirmatory public vote - Peter Kyle**

>Calls for a confirmatory referendum to approve Brexit deal before it is ratified by parliament.

>The same proposal, then put forward by Labour lawmaker Margaret Beckett, was supported by 268 lawmakers and opposed by 295.

>**F) Public vote to prevent no deal - Graham Jones**

>Calls for a public vote if it were necessary to prevent Britain leaving the EU without a deal.

>This is a new proposal, which was not submitted last week.

>**G) Parliamentary Supremacy - Joanna Cherry**

>Says that if Britain has not ratified an exit deal within two days of the day it is due to leave the EU, the government should seek a further extension to the Article 50 negotiating period.

>If a Brexit delay has not been agreed by the day before exit day, the government should seek parliament’s approval for leaving without a deal and if that approval is not given, the government should revoke Article 50 to cancel Brexit.

>This is an expanded, more detailed version of a proposal put forward by Cherry last week. That proposal was supported by 184 lawmakers and opposed by 293.

>**H) EFTA and EEA - George Eustice**

>Calls for Britain to remain a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) and seek a further short delay to Brexit while Britain rejoins the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).

>A very similar proposal put forward by Eustice last week got just 64 votes in favour, and was opposed by 377 lawmakers.

A stands no chance of being selected because the EU has said no. B will not get selected because it lost by a majority of 240 votes. C will get selected. D stands a good chance of getting selected. E or F will get selected because they're functionally the same. G is hilarious and I hope it gets selected for that reason. H will not be selected because it lost by a margin of 213.

I feel like they should re-run B and H despite the large majorities against last time, just to re-confirm that those two ‘extreme’ positions are still not wanted by anyone.
Otherwise if a majority is reached on any option, I can see people trying to say ‘oh I’d rather have no deal than this but I couldn’t express that opinion any more because it wasn’t selected’.

They should allow all proposals and have a ranked vote. That way no-one can say ‘all the proposals were useless, oh if only one of the other ones were allowed to be voted on’ (I remember one MP making this sort of argument after last time asking if the proposals that weren’t up for vote last time round could be included the second time round). Put every option on the table, that way there should be no excuses (but I get your points about some of the options being very unlikely to be allowed by the EU even if they got a significant majority).
What a mess....

I'm looking for a place to start my medical residency. In my country (Greece), medical residents have a hard time. It's a combination of bad salaries, unpaid (not underpaid) overworking, too many patients, not always a good education. So I know many people may complain about the NHS of UK but in Greek it's worse. I'm not asking about the medical part (I suppose doctors will be rare here, in a non-medical forum) but I'm mostly asking about the other things that concern my staying. 

I've only been to Edinburgh for a week, I fell in love with it (my other alternative is Dublin). I'm considering for a city in Scotland (I'd prefer Edinburgh but I'm open to ideas).

I'm worried, I think of a lot of things. I worry that I will feel as an immigrant, or that people may look low on me. I don't really mind the cloudy/misty/rainy/whatever weather. The heat of Greece exhausts me. I just want to offer my medical service and receive a proper salary. 

So I don't know how exactly to ask, but would the Scottish society welcome a Greek? I think (from a previous post) that Scottish don't have anything against Greeks. Would it be easy to socialise I wonder? And one more think, I hate drinking and I've heard (could be a stereotype) that many people in UK drink too much, especially Friiday-Saturday. 

Anyway..if someone would like to comment or share any advice, I'd be very happy to hear it.

Please do join reform. Split the vote of the right further and do us all a favour.

Do who a favour? Literally no one wants the level of immigration we have apart from a fringe group of ultra far-left ""the state will own everything, you'll have nothing and be happy"" types. They've not calculated that non EU migration is a fiscal loss therefore this state will have no money.

Do everyone left of the hard right a favour. This isn’t about immigration, it’s about the Tories wider electoral prospects. If they split the vote of the right Labour under Starmer will still work to control immigration because they recognise that it is unsustainable as it is.

The far-right basically don't exist in the UK (unlike most of Europe). I would vote Labour if they promise to reform the voting system to PR. Immigration is way way too high. 1.2m a year. Fucking hell.

So their country is protected from people who come to work.

That got cancelled

He's right, but this was such a monumental clusterfuck on the part of Coutts and NatWest that there was no other outcome.

The ironic part is, it was reported that Farage initially received no stated reason for the closure of his account, which prompted him to make the SAR. If the bank had just given him the reason the committee concluded last November (according to the report), ""your account has been below our commercial requirements for some time"", then they probably would have avoided all this embarrassment.

Tbh I don't believe Farage that he wasn't given a reason, sorry. I don't take known liars at their word.

Except Coutts could not provide any proof Farage *was* provided a reason, could they?

Currently texting my pregnant fiancé who is shopping for maternity clothes, but is struggling to find any shops. Then I remembered that Mothercare existed, not long ago but closed down. How has nothing come in to take that gap? You might get some baby stuff from the likes of Smyths and some clothes from Matalan but there's nothing that all your baby needs in one shop. I also think online shopping for baby stuff is probably not the best, maternity clothes will fit differently, you'll want to see the quality of cribs/car seats and I think many others will share that sentiment. 

Edit: as a lot of people seem to be missing my point. Yes I know supermarkets sell baby clothes, I know Smyths sells cribs and what not. But why is there not ONE single shop i.e. Mothercare that sells everything you would need for a baby from mat clothes, to baby clothes to prams. You've got Mama's and Papa's but they're far and few between. There's obviously a market for buying baby stuff via brick and mortar shops, so again my question is why has nothing taken up the Mothercare hole.

Obviously this will just mean that EU member states may retaliate with similar measures, which will lead to UK immigrants in the EU and EU immigrants in the UK paying the price.

Secondly, this will block any cooperation with the UK on sharing of information (good luck trying to stop EU citizens with a criminal record at the border if the EU refuses to share information with you).

Thirdly, this will jeopardize cooperation on extraditions. You can not refuse taking your own citizens back if they are deported, but you have no obligation to allow others. This will make the new ""tough"" immigration policy unworkable or extremely costly.

And last but not least, this will further damage the UK's reputation and strain what remains of its relationship with all of its neighbours. The UK will become even more unpopular abroad both with the public and with governments, which will have repercussions.

>You can not refuse taking your own citizens back if they are deported

It's not common but you can. Several countries are refusing nationals back on their soil when they are obviously going to be problems (the case of EUropean nationals who fought by ISIS side and are now detained in Iraq come to my mind).

You have a point, but these are extreme cases. 

My country's government *tried*, but the constitutional court blocked it. They also tried to strip them of nationality, but that was also blocked.

That will not happen to people convicted of normal crimes, and certainly not to people who just have a criminal record.

We can assume it will not happen to people convicted of normal crimes. Yes, I agree.

On the other hand, people assumed the UK would never leave the EU, Trump would not be elected and so on."

The thing is. I *get* the idea of National Service. And its clear that the NATO governments are more worried than they have been in a while about a threat to them. As such, having more people who are qualified and able to fight if we get attacked is objectively a good thing for our security. Just as its important that we have more people who can actively help out in case of disaster i.e. emergency response

Poll shows a similar proportion would be more likely to vote for a united Ireland if it increased their earnings

The economic effects of a united Ireland on voters’ personal finances would have a crucial impact on their choice in any future referendums, according to the latest research.

Almost half of all voters in Northern Ireland who expressed a preference – 43 per cent of the total – said they would be less likely to vote for a united Ireland if it meant they would be £3,500 a year worse off.

Almost as many – this figure includes 23 per cent of voters from a Protestant background and a third (33 per cent) of voters who describe themselves as neither Catholic nor Protestant – 38 per cent of voters in Northern Ireland said they would be more likely to vote for a united Ireland if it meant they would be £3,500 better off.

The findings in the Republic are strikingly similar when voters are asked about the impact of a potential blow to their financial circumstances. When asked how it would affect their vote in a unity referendum if they would be €4,000 worse off as a result, 44 per cent said this would make them less likely to vote in favour of a united Ireland. This includes 27 per cent who say it would make them “a lot less likely to vote for Irish unity”.

While large numbers of voters say the economic effects of unity would have no bearing on their choice, today’s poll numbers show how crucial the economic questions would be in any unity referendums.

Less than a third of voters in the South (31 per cent) say that the impact on their finances would make no difference, while this rises to between 41 and 47 per cent in North, reflecting the greater importance of sovereignty issues there.

The opinion polls are part of the North and South series, a research collaboration between ARINS and The Irish Times. ARINS, Analysing and Researching Ireland North and South, is a joint project of the Royal Irish Academy and the Keough-Naughton Institute for Irish Studies at the University of Notre Dame. This is the second year of the collaboration between The Irish Times and ARINS.

The simultaneous, identical polls were taken by Ipsos B&A in the Republic and Ipsos in Northern Ireland, who conducted in-home interviews with more than 1,000 voters in each jurisdiction. The margin of error in each is estimated to be +/-3.1 per cent.

Poll Monday

Respondents to the polls were also asked about one of the possible means of meeting the costs of a united Ireland. In this instance, voters were asked for their views on whether the Republic – which is currently running a large surplus in its public finances – should “invest 10 per cent of its annual budget surplus in a sovereign wealth fund set aside to prepare for a united Ireland”.

More than a third of voters in the Republic (36 per cent) agreed with the proposal, while just over a quarter (26 per cent) disagreed. Some 29 per cent said they “would like to know more about this idea before I came to a view”.

In Northern Ireland, 44 per cent of people are in favour of the proposal, while 28 per cent are opposed, and 16 per cent said they would like to know more. Almost a third (32 per cent) of voters from neither a Catholic nor Protestant background are in favour, along with 27 per cent of voters from a Protestant background. A majority of Protestants who express a view either way – 41 per cent of the total – are, however, against the idea.

I’ll 100% be voting with my pocket if it ever comes to it.

How will you know? I imagine one side will say you'll be better off and one side worse off

I’ll have to make that decision at the time. But currently from what I know about the republic, in terms of income, taxation and investment options I’m probably better off financially being a part of the UK.

Disposable incomes are much higher in RoI, benefits are also a lot higher. Not sure what end of the spectrum you are on but it's difficult for me to see how we wouldn't benefit long term.

I'm interested - how did I do?

People from all ways of life have always stated that we should hold principles in high regard.  It's part of our DNA.  A principled person is a good person.  Generally, we all kinda' agree.  

Whilst leading this life, it is considered part of our culture that our principles should beat our desire for fame & our principles should beat our desire for power.  I'm almost afraid to say this, but principles should beat our desire for money.

In 2016 we were asked to choose between two sets of principles.  

The first can, without argument from any quarter, be called 'More of the same'.  Change nothing, blandly walk forwards.  High poverty levels?  Blandly walk forward.  Proposals for our countrymen to fight and die for a primarily-foreign-controlled 'EU army' on god knows what venture -blandly walk forward.  

This system/club we've entered into makes certain absolute demands from it's followers which arn't up for debate.  Arn't allowed to be questionned.  Foreigners are good.  The club knows better than us.  EUs environmental protection is better than we could come up with.  And animal rights, and trade union rights, and thousands of other areas.  The club knows better than us.  Dissent will not be tolerated.  Trust 'the club' beyond yourselves.

For example: If it is 100% fact that a vast number of crimes are committed by migrants - followers of the faith arn't allowed to even DISCUSS THIS FACT.  If it is 100% fact that the high street has more foreign-language shops than English, followers of the faith ARN'T ALLOWED TO EVEN DISCUSS THIS FACT.  

Of course the people that this is working out for - the professionals bringing in £150,000 a year, just accept the status-quo because .. hey .. payday in 4 days and they never have to go down the high street anyway.  They employ 35 EU people for chump-change anyway (yea they know the local lads are desperate for work or just to have some kind of break in life but fuck them all eh when the rich guys can get even richer off underpaying desperate Polish guys?  Whilst laughing, sipping their champagne and deep down really believing they're the guys that ARE politically correct and we're the scum!)  The gates of their gated community have one single purpose - to keep 'those people' away.  Though the all-watching 'club' demands they also don't state that out loud.  It's just yet another unsaid truth.  

So we have rich and elites who are prepared to put up with a bit of Orwellianism and government sterility because .. fuck it .. they've got 3*70 inch TVs and a Jag.  They don't ever have to visit Hounslow or Brixton or Grimsby no matter live there.  And hey - if you play along - who knows, maybe one day you'll have the Jag.  Just don't break the primary rule and state the problems with the EU or with mass migration or the fact you're already broke but your annual tax summary literally shows your hard earned money going abroad to the EU.  

Not allowed to mention it, not allowed to question it.  Of course the emporer has fine clothes.  Now smile, take your f'kin paycheck, next time you get lost and end up in a council estate for 20 minutes, make no eye contact and deep down don't give a shit about why those people live in those shitty houses and what is going wrong - easier just to blame them as individuals for not trying hard enough or something and ignore the massive influx of EU workers and move along .. don't worry, you'll be back behind your £1200 front door soon - just bury those 'principles' you're supposed to have about actually helping other local people find decent work for a little bit longer.

But there is an alternative set of principles - decent principles that should resonate which anyone from any country.  A path where we are allowed to talk about these subjects without immediately being branded racists just for daring to have an opinion thats not fumbling forward with the herd - like - you know - we're supposed to have as a corner-stone of British life.  A way in which the British government, you know, actually elected by the British people, is allowed to help the British people even if they believes this involves restricting European immigration or - heaven forbid - actually striking a trade deal with America and COMPETING (I can hear the remainers now:  'how unpatriotic, suggesting the British should compete - we're all too crap for that').  

Now at this point obviously some folk will smugly shout 'we had veto in the EU so we only took the rules we wanted'.  This is where a lack of knowledge of international diplomacy, and a lack of knowledge of soft power comes in.  

Take the latest EU negotiations - do you really think 27 countries exactly precisely agreed on what to offer the UK and mystically spoke in one united voice through Barnier as some kind of huge fluke?  Of course they didn't - the outliers got taken into a quiet dark room where Germany and France patiently explained exactly the consequences of making waves or disagreeing with the 'big fish' of the club (No they're not 'all equal' .. when was the last time you heard a Romanian representative say anything of substance to anyone?  They don't - they shut their mouths, behave like good little boys, and take the bag of gold.  Does this 'club' still sound fantastic?  How much is your little pot of gold really costing you?).  

Soft power and diplomacy is the very embodiment of the EU - it prides itself on it - both internally and externally it has the highest soft-power (often not so soft) in the world.  People think 'The word soft sounds not too bad'?  Really?

It forced Greece to make austerity measures it simply didn't want to do plunging millions into poverty.  It forced all countries to obey many Iranian sanctions even though many understood Iran did nothing to deserve them.  It forces Spain to follow economic policy resulting in over 25% of its 18-25 year old being unemployed.  So I ask you - as principle - even if the EU offers you a sack, hell, a cart full of gold - do you really want to be part of that?  Where do your principles stop and the money start?


So - the remain group - 'hey Britboy - side with us - you can live in the same shitty council house, earning 22K for a job you hate, damn well forever.  Nothing will change - except you won't hear English spoken at all down the market in a few years and god forbid you even murmer about it you f'kin racist.  You're done - not even your own government can save you - they're 'not even allowed' to take certain measures to help me because of the 'elites will get even richer' club called the EU.'

Well, out of principle I reject the sterilisation of my government. I reject 'Britboy, your life is shitty and it will be forever' and I reject 'You are not allowed to even mention the things that piss you off'.  I challenge remainers to even attempt to understand how principle could ever be placed above money.  Manage that, and you're half way there.

I think you did a pretty good job!

You touched on several key aspects understanding that there is no one single reason to support Brexit. Most importantly 'principles over money', the nature of EU decision-making and being quickly silenced for wanting to debate actual problems of the EU or the UK or when opposing the ideas of further integration.

The sad truth is whenever a Brexiteer honestly writes something similar they get massively downvoted in this sub. Some arguments cannot be objectively defended with data and statistics so whenever they mention ""principle over money"" or aspects of sovereignty (all laws should come from domestic parliament) it's a lost cause for them. I'll be interested to see how your post does after few days. This very post of mine will be in the red again without a doubt.

Arguments that cannot be objectively defended with data and statistics are also commonly referred to as irrational. The heart over head arguments and appeals to emotion are the substantive basis for Brexit. So it’s impossible to argue them here successfully, ergo they get downvoted. Why you ask, should they be downvoted, people are voting irrationally, downvoting something they just don’t like. And then you realize, you’ve actually answered your own question.

And here we go again. Ignore what I wrote and ask for data and statistics on questions of principle.

""All laws should come from national parliament, one law forced by the EU to be implemented into UK legal system is one too many"" does not need statistics. It is a matter of principle. You choose to dismiss it, I get that.

Have you heard of regulatory alignment? Most EU laws are to do with this to make sure there is a level playing field within the EU. When outside of the EU, we will still need to accept most of these and new regulations to trade with them, but without a say in them. The US are also wanting us to change regulations to get a trade deal with them.

No country whom extends business beyond its borders can be wholly free of external influence in laws and regulations.

Here is the catch: only exporters into EU will have to accept them. The rest of businesses (I read a figure of 80 %) who do not export into the EU will not need to observe and follow their regulation. They will be ok following UK domestic regulation which can be relaxed. So that, for example, smoked kippers can be sent around the UK without cooling pads. Regulations really does not need to be applied on a per-country basis. Per company is well enough.

U.K. reg on kippers. [Look it up.](https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/politics/done-like-a-kipper-boris-discovers-plastic-ice-pillow-is-actually-a-british-rule-not-eu/18/07/) 

John makes doodads. John does not export to the EU. Pete buys these doodads and uses them to make doohickeys. These then get exported to the EU. John has to make EU regulation doodads, or Pete won’t buy them.

Is that really so? Let's demonstrate it on an actual example.

Apple buys rare earths from miners mostly in China. Do miners in China follow EU regulations? No they do not. Are Apple products exported into the EU? Yes they are.

What have I missed?

There are so many component regulations, it would be harder to go through your life without seeing/hearing of any.

Fire retardant regs on furniture/toy stuffing etc etc

Yeah but that is all on Apple to meet regulations of their target markets. Destination countries' regulation do not apply to arbitrary depth of the whole supply chain. If Apple can buy raw material and components from companies who are not subject to EU regulation and then export their products into the EU why does your example with John and Pete require both to follow EU rules?"

Has this sub become more pro-Brexit or am I missing something? It seems like every thread that has to do with ""the cost of Brexit"" or similar (such as the Sadiq Khan one just now) seems to totally misunderstand what the economic case against it was and insists that because the EU economy isn't doing that well, the UK is somehow intrinsically better off outside of it, while also ignoring any evidence and presenting irrelevant data to substantiate that.

Today is the first day of our election coverage, covering the polling day. This will be stickied until 10pm tonight when the polls shut, and a new one will be put up as the results come in. Finally, on Friday night, my usual Friday night thread will be up allowing for discussion on the aftermath for the weekend. I usually have a 'No politics!' rule in my Friday Night Thread Fest thread but this will be relaxed for the General Election aftermath.

We hope you're all making the effort to vote whether it's SNP, UKIP, or a big massive cock and balls on the ballot paper to show your displeasure.

Please be civil, please feel free to share who you voted, but please keep all election/political self-post material to this thread only. 

##Any political/'I voted!' self posts will be removed. Keep election coverage to this thread.

which is Scotland.

So let's get this straight.

We've had news about an SNP MP who took the train while she knew that she had COVID.  I am in no way standing up for her and she deserved to be disciplined, but let's remember that the night before Queen Elizabeth II laid her husband to rest sitting alone, the Tories were having boozy parties.  It's a different magnitude.

We've had news about the purchase of a vehicle by a political party which resulted in the covering of the former First Minister's house in a way akin to that of the house of Fred West.  Firstly, it's actually none of anyone's business what a political party spends its money on: that's for its members to decide.  Secondly, what you may find immoral is not necessarily illegal.  And no one was convicted.  Do we live in a land where you get trial by mob?

We've had news about a member who used his iPad in Morocco and offered to pay the bill.

We've had news on Nicola Sturgeon deleting WhatsApp messages, while that is the CURRENT GOVERNMENT ADVICE.  I have a job with similar advice.

We've had news about Humza Yousaf's brother in law, and while I think the police need to follow up on that, it really has nothing to do with Yousaf.  I have to be honest, I'm not sure what my brother's cat is doing right now.

They really can't find anything.  They are scraping the bottom of the barrel to find things to complain about and I'm fed up with it.

If you have a proper political point to make, I'm all ears.  But this shit is just that.  Shit.

what compels people like you to prostrate yourself like this and become apologist zealots for politicians and their parties? so thoroughly undignified.   


get a life is what I would say to you, and that goes for everyone who engages with the soap opera of so called ""politics."" nothing of what you are talking about actually matters.

Except it does matter my friend.  It REALLY matters.  I'm not apologising for anyone and you will see from my post that I said that an SNP MP should have been disciplined because she was wrong.  Which did happen.

It does matter

how did anything you mentioned there affect you or anyone you know whatsoever? I don't even know what you are talking about, and neither should you.  


by contrast, how has the Scottish education system with all its record breaking failures affected you? quite markedly, it seems.

Oh that will be why I have a master's degree, earn loads of money and don't have a pile of student debt then?

Don't be daft.  I should know what I'm talking about and I do.  Maybe I don't just think about myself.

perhaps the greatest indictment of the education system of them all, then."

> This is a problem made under their watch'
Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves MP says that illegal immigration has been on the increase whilst Conservatives have been in government and calls the lack of deportations ""12 years of Tory failure""

https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1577314725389602828?t=6ALZzqA7EyavH1X_jfmvHg&s=19

The party is polling stupidly clear. There's no reason to pander to the right like this other than because it's what they believe.

I won’t defend this, I don’t agree with it.
I’ll try to explain it.

Labour does not want to fight the next election on Immigration. It’s one of the few areas right now where the conservatives can beat the tories, even if their record is abysmal.


Keeping rhetoric like this may be good defensively for winning the next election. Hopefully whilst in power, significant positive reforms are made. Increasing legal pathways will lower illegal immigration and give us a right wing sounding figure to use, with a left wing policy.

EDIT I meant labour. I’ve spoke about the Tories so much I’m going mad

EDIT 2: To be clear Reeves could be speaking from the heart. I’m just saying that she could be playing politics. The next labour government will be the proof of Labour’s policy.

>	conservatives can beat the tories

Freudian slip lol.

>	Keeping rhetoric like this may be good defensively for winning the next election. Hopefully whilst in power, significant positive reforms are made

Why are you discounting the idea that they are simply saying what they believe? Labours last go in government was marked by very racist rhetoric, policies and ministers.

Good spot. I’ve talked about the tories more than is healthy.


You’re right, it’s perfectly possible this is what she believes. It is not too out of step with the new labour policy. I’m suggesting that it may also just be playing politics. We’ll have to see in the next Labour government

When you’re polling as far as ahead as Labour currently are the only reason to come out swinging like this is if you actually believe it.

This isn’t even her brief!

Arguably, but this is a rather centralised leadership and she’s part of the dynamic duo at the top.

Also she was asked a question regarding immigration, she didn’t just come out of nowhere with it.

I just don’t understand why you would give her the benefit of the doubt?

I give everyone the benefit of the doubt

I think that’s foolish when you’re talking about politics."

>NEW: Conservative peer Lord Ranger to be suspended from the Lords for three weeks and banned from parliamentary bars for a year after drunkenly berating people in Strangers 

Full report here : https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5804/ldselect/ldcond/117/11703.htm#_idTextAnchor003. Lord Ranger joined a group which included two young women, made inappropriate comments to them, then harassed, swore at and berated them.

Lord Ranger was an unsuccessful Conservative parliamentary and London authority candidate who had a role under Boris Johnson as mayor and was elevated by Johnson in 2022.

The fine quality of members of our unelected second chamber on show. Lord (and Lords) knows we should never make any constitutional changes which might result in the loss of the expertise,  experience and integrity found in abundance in our Upper House.

I've said it before and I'll say it again abolish the parliamentary bars.

It turns out the SG have done reasonably detailed analysis on an independent Scotland joining the EU, but they only released it after an FOI.

Curious that none of this made it into any of their recent Independence papers...

In the worst case scenario, should Scotland have voted Yes in 2014, we'd be EU members now, but because we voted No, we're not.

I’m not sure you understand what “worst case scenario” means, since there was and still is no guarantee an independent Scotland would vote to rejoin the EU nor that we’d have our application accepted, certainly not that we’d have managed to meet the requirements already. Worst case would be that we’d be blocked by any single member and be stuck outside both the EU and the UK.

Not to mention he's ignoring the bit about having to conclude legal separation from the UK before the application can even be made.

Except that the EU said there's no reason the negotiations couldn't run parallel with the legal process of obtaining independence.

If you read the actual docs in the release, it's quite clear that's not the case that's being planned for. 

It even says at one point such an arrangement, and again it's not the central case, would probably require UK consent.

Not sure why this is being downvoted, this is absolutely the case. It's not *solely* because of soaring immigration but let's not pretend that immigration isn't a clear factor in the need for far greater housing.

Although there is a large irony to this problem: The biggest factor holding back additional construction is the lack of enough skilled trade to build at that rate, and not just builders and plumbers but *every role* from top to bottom. You can bring that talent in from overseas (and I'm ignoring for a second that this is often far more difficult than it's made out to be) but then you're adding to the problem before you can start resolving the problem...

Well, I finished it.

All 650 Seat predictions for 2024.

And it’s fair to say the results surprised me.

I erred on the side of caution in a lot of places. But here’s my final numbers:

Labour - 325

Tories - 231

Lib Dems - 38

SNP - 34

Sinn Fein - 7

DUP - 7

Plaid - 3

SDLP - 2

Alliance - 2

Speaker - 1

Takeaways:

- I expected Labour to have a small overall majority. They fall just short of one. Honestly the challenge Labour has is a big one, and securing an overall majority is on a knife edge.

- Tories about right I feel. Could fall lower, but in order to do that Labour need to be actively winning over voters, not just relying on apathetic Tories.

- Lib Dems do much better than I expected. Honestly, don’t like Swinson, but the numbers show her strategy very nearly worked in 2019. There are loads of seats where the Lib Dems are challenging.

- SNP hold on better than I expected. Scottish Labour pick up about 15 - 20 seats, but after that they need much higher swings to drag the SNP below 30 seats.

As an aside: we're not kidding when we say the subreddit is running rather warm at the moment.

Yesterday saw **84** posts and **1,448** comments removed, roughly evenly split between manual and automatic actions. That's approximately 1 removal per minute over the course of 24 hours.

Please do continue to report rule-breaking content, and bear with us. Cheers.

I've been browsing around the internet and I've found many views which are for and against immigration. To be honest both sides seem crazy to me.(I live in London).

To things I've noticed while looking at opinions are two main ones where : '' Immigration is diluting the population, culture and traditions of this country making the streets more polluted etc(add insert problem in city)'' or ''We should allow more immigration unrestrained with no border policies(not enough infostructure can support it/home prices will go up) or this is revenge for [colonialism.](https://colonialism.So)

 So honestly I don't like culture being thrown away but I think that's just the times so I want to hear an opion outside the extremes about this issue of immigration and illegal immigration

Another question I have is :Why does the uk allow illegal immigrants to come in and pay for the homes when their crisis in the uk economy

I would suggest you look at the history of immigration for the UK, numbers by each year.

And then look at the political parties and see their stance.

Of the parties anyone would mention.

The most extreme pro immigration party is the greens (if we discount the Tories), they are overly open borders & as such you can take them as happy at current levels or infinity depending on your preference.

The most extreme anti immigration party is reform looking for net zero immigration, that means about 500k gross under current levels.

Oddly only one gets labeled as extremists.

And in retaliation the french will just let them on the ferrys to Dover not a solution after all the borders in the Irish sea for goods how come they can get on a ferry to Belfast anyway just showing the UK government have not got a clue where these people are at any point in time utterly useless

That requires going through passport controls which is ran by the UK Border Force. So France would have to end the agreement on border cooperation.

On the french side

Yeah it’s operated by the British Border Force and the French equivalent operates on our side.

Well the french could end cooperation at the border as it one way traffic migrants wise this needs a Europe wide solution don't expect one until the next government

They could but it would be pretty stupid of them to openly engage in people smuggling and would just result in the termination of passenger ferry services between the two countries.

As is the case for the UK by suggesting bussing people to the Irish border.

No. The suggestion was to send them to facilities near the border as they will essentially complete the migration to Ireland themselves. Not to smuggle them across the border. Plus, there are no border checks between the UK and Ireland."

This will only rise over winter I expect. I just wonder when MPs will start campaigning on a Brejoin platform.

Not soon. No one is going to touch that with a barge poll until there is very strong evidence of feeling over a substained period.

How long a period out of interest?

[There have been polls for the last 2 years](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/should-the-united-kingdom-join-the-european-union-or-stay-out-of-the-european-union/) with swings between yes and no and over the last year (to September 16th 2021), of 33 polls that asked this, 6 had a stay out majority and none since 12th May (that was a 33/34 with 33 don't know). Only 3 this calendar year and two of them by Redfield & Wilton who are rated B/C by aggregator FiveThirtyEight, while rejoin has enjoyed 5-10+ point leads. 

I don't imagine we will rejoin any time soon but a new government moving closer to say EEA or EFTA would solve a lot of our issues of trade

I’m 100% in favour of rejoining, but I wonder how these numbers might move if rejoining meant rejoining without any of the perks and exceptions we used to have, I.e. we switch to the Euro, join Schengen, etc

I can't account for everyone's mental math skills, but the way I see the equation asked is: ""Do you want a fuller cup than you have now, even if it can't be as full as it would have been had you not spilled what was in your cup?""

After 13 years of Tory misrule we could probably get some EU regional development funds if we rejoin. But sadly, the current Labour leadership hasn't got the brains or the balls to put it in their manifesto.

I'm sorry, but refusing to hold a vote on an issue that is losing by ~5x what it won by eight years ago is a suspension of democracy that shouldn't be acceptable.

There is already 8 years of new voters that never had a say staring down a second decade of the path their adult life was altered without their say. Life is too short to keep these economic headwinds on the potential of those in their 20s and 30s. 

(On a peripheral note, I recall headlines of the need to increase the UK's birthrate. I'm going to say it right now, facing a future that's being limited limits the plans of having kids. If the UK wants kids, those potential parents are going to want more job opportunities, cheaper goods and the child care availability that is only going to happen with FoM.)

First off, I'm quite grateful to the UK for all the Ukraine support. They're really doing a lot, way more than I would have expected.

My background. I'm a dual British-Ukrainian citizen living in the UK. I have a family here, and I also have a son from the previous marriage in Ukraine. He's 14. He never planned to come and live in the UK, he was quite happy in Ukraine. That obviously changed and I'd like to somehow get hold of him.

His mum agreed to try and bring him to a neighbouring country (Moldova or Poland maybe), and I thought I would just go and fetch him to bring him to the UK with.

Reading so many news about supporting Ukrainian refugees I thought it would be a piece of cake from the legal point of view, but, alas, the only thing that the government relaxed so far is taking your immediate family member to the UK if you're a British citizen living in Ukraine:

https://www.gov.uk/guidance/support-for-family-members-of-british-nationals-in-ukraine-and-ukrainian-nationals-in-ukraine-and-the-uk

Which is the right step forward, of course. 

But since I don't live in Ukraine, I can only apply for the general family visa:

https://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa

Which is quite expensive (£1,500  + £2,350 NHS surcharge), and there's no super priority option. Meaning if he escapes to Moldova and I meet him there, we'll have to apply for visa and wait for months in a country we have no connection to for a decision that might be negative.

The money is a concern, but it could be borrowed; I'm mostly worried about all that long waiting for the decision.

In any case, could someone confirm my understanding is correct and applying for a family visa seems to be our only option? 

If that's correct, is there any way to try and influence the government to further relax the rules in a more meaningful way?

Please pardon my English. I'm a confident and fluent speaker of English, but it's not my native language.

Also, I know immigration is a controversial topic, but could you please try and avoid saying any mean things to me, cause the life is stressful enough even without being abused on reddit for bringing up controversial issues.

Bring him to the UK on a visitor visa if that gets him out of the Ukraine. You get 6 months on that. You will then have time to deal with the rest.

I believe the problem with visitor visa is that you have to ""prove"" that you will return at the end of your stay, difficult under the circumstances. And then the Home Office would be underhand enough to use that as evidence against any subsequent application to settle in the UK. This is why I would seek legal advice before attempting to complete any applications."

which is Scotland.

So let's get this straight.

We've had news about an SNP MP who took the train while she knew that she had COVID.  I am in no way standing up for her and she deserved to be disciplined, but let's remember that the night before Queen Elizabeth II laid her husband to rest sitting alone, the Tories were having boozy parties.  It's a different magnitude.

We've had news about the purchase of a vehicle by a political party which resulted in the covering of the former First Minister's house in a way akin to that of the house of Fred West.  Firstly, it's actually none of anyone's business what a political party spends its money on: that's for its members to decide.  Secondly, what you may find immoral is not necessarily illegal.  And no one was convicted.  Do we live in a land where you get trial by mob?

We've had news about a member who used his iPad in Morocco and offered to pay the bill.

We've had news on Nicola Sturgeon deleting WhatsApp messages, while that is the CURRENT GOVERNMENT ADVICE.  I have a job with similar advice.

We've had news about Humza Yousaf's brother in law, and while I think the police need to follow up on that, it really has nothing to do with Yousaf.  I have to be honest, I'm not sure what my brother's cat is doing right now.

They really can't find anything.  They are scraping the bottom of the barrel to find things to complain about and I'm fed up with it.

If you have a proper political point to make, I'm all ears.  But this shit is just that.  Shit.

Buying a huge camper van with misappropriated funds is objectively hilarious tho.

Sometimes it's just funny to laugh at idiots doing stupid shit, that's pretty much life at the moment. Life being the internet.

No such thing as objective hilarity.

Utterly bizarre to see Truss still making headlines.  Currently top of the guardian's live blog with her views on their homepage. 

Why are we getting her views on things?  Who wants to hear them?  Certainly most tories are embarrassed by her and the rest of the population surely don't give a shit about what she has to say.

She's at best thick, and at worst dangerous.  Probably a mix of both.

She has nothing interesting / useful to say.

She’s releasing a book, so it’s promo. Journalists are now finally being given access to interview her.

I am also partial to this article of his:

He really should hang his head in shame and withdraw from public life.

This is fantastic - in the sense that it's a complete fantasy:

>It’s 24 June, 2025, and Britain is marking its annual Independence Day celebration. \[...\] The years that followed the 2016 referendum didn’t just reinvigorate our economy, our democracy and our liberty.

Can he top that? Of course he can:

>The United Kingdom is now the region’s foremost knowledge-based economy. We lead the world in biotech, law, education, the audio-visual sector, financial services and software. 

Speaking of software:

>Opting out of the EU’s data protection rules has turned Hoxton into the software capital of the world.

OK! Over to the financial side:

>Financial services are booming – not only in London, but in Birmingham, Leeds and Edinburgh too. \[...\] No other European city could hope to compete: their high rates of personal and corporate taxation, restrictive employment practices and lack of support services left London unchallenged.

But the best part is the final but one paragraph:

>Unsurprisingly, several other European countries have opted to copy Britain’s deal with the EU, based as it is upon a common market rather than a common government. Some of these countries were drawn from EFTA (Norway, Switzerland and Iceland are all bringing their arrangements into line with ours). Some came from further afield (Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine). Some followed us out of the EU (Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands).  
**The United Kingdom now leads a 22-state bloc** that forms a free trade area with the EU, but remains outside its political structures.

## SUMMARY

Welcome back to another mid-week megathread! With less than a month to go, the election period is in full swing, and parties are hosting rallies and making media appearances left, right, and centre. We've almost reached the point of party manifestos being released, but that isn't expected until next week at the earliest.

Yesterday was another day of electioneering, with **Labour** announcing plans to offer [free vocational retraining to adults](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-50378666) through a scheme worth £3bn, **Nigel Farage** of the Brexit Party [calling on the Conservatives to stand down candidates in Labour seats](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50387254), and the **Lib Dems** [pledging £5bn to improve flood defences](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50380565) across the UK.

The **Conservatives** again [attacked](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50383018) Labour's spending plans, claiming that the plans would result in an additional £2,400 in tax per taxpayer per year. The figures used by the Tories are ""based on assumptions about money Labour intends to spend"" and also ""how much revenue the party intends to raise"". However, the accuracy of this figure has been [called into question](https://fullfact.org/news/cost-of-corbyn-figure-flawed/).

## DEVELOPMENTS

*Context added for non-UK visitors. All times GMT (UK) unless otherwise stated. If anything is missing here, ping /u/jaydenkieran or u/carrot-carrot.*


**TODAY:**

- **Labour** have promised to [spend more on the NHS](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50397847) than the Tories, increasing the NHS budget to £155bn by 2023-24. This is £6bn higher than the 5-year plan laid out by the current Conservative government last year.

- **David Gauke**, the former justice secretary (and one of the MPs expelled from the Tories after voting to force the government into requesting a Brexit extension), has said that [a Conservative majority would be a ""bad outcome for the country""](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50398115). ""Leaving the implementation period on WTO terms would be devastating to many sectors of our economy. It's a thoroughly irresponsible policy."". Gauke will be standing as an independent candidate in the election.

- The **Liberal Democrats** have pledged to invest £500m per year on youth services in England to try and prevent teenagers from being drawn into violence by adopting a ""public health approach"" to knife crime. ""We are in a knife crime epidemic, but successive governments have taken the wrong approach to dealing with it,"" says Jo Swinson.

- **Boris Johnson** [visited](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-50398877) parts of the country that have been affected by recent flooding. In Stainforth, South Yorkshire, Johnson was heckled by members of the public for the Government's response to the flooding, and one person [told him](https://twitter.com/joepike/status/1194592831479963649), ""It’s took you over five days. You should have been there Saturday morning having a meeting... and I’m sorry your announcements yesterday were a pittance.""

- In Glasgow, Labour leader **Jeremy Corbyn** [is heckled](https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1194595607073185793) by a man who says, ""Do you think the man that's going to be Prime Minister of this country should be a terrorist sympathiser, Mr Corbyn?"" The man [was identified](https://twitter.com/RaynerSkyNews/status/1194645872019152896) as Rev Richard Cameron, a Church of Scotland minister, who has previously made homophobic and islamophobic comments on social media. A statement from the Church of Scotland said that they will investigate all complaints.

- In a speech, Labour's Shadow Chancellor **John McDonnell** [said that](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-labour-nhs-four-day-week-mcdonnell-ashworth-corbyn-a9201266.html) Labour's ""four-day week"" pledge would also apply to NHS staff. The Shadow Health Secretary **Jonathan Ashworth** previously said in a number of interviews that it *would not* apply to NHS staff.

- **Royal Mail** [have won](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50409317) a High Court injunction to block strikes by postal workers over the Christmas period, which also could have disrupted postal voting for the upcoming election.

- Brexit Party leader **Nigel Farage** [confirms](https://twitter.com/lewis_goodall/status/1194627469409603585) he will not stand down candidates in Tory target seats. The Brexit Party had recently stood down all candidates in 317 seats that were won by the Conservatives in the 2017 election.

- The **Bureau of Investigative Journalism** [announce](https://twitter.com/TBIJ/status/1194622823450468352) they have launched an ""urgent legal challenge"" aimed at forcing the Government to publish the report on Russian interference into elections/referendums which had been created by the UK Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee.

- The **Scottish National Party** [have launched](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-50410790) legal action against ITV, challenging their upcoming head-to-head debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. Party leader **Nicola Sturgeon** said, ""To exclude the SNP would be a fundamental breach of broadcasters' obligations to fully and properly represent and reflect the views of the whole UK.""

An interesting comment on the recent Kantar poll:

https://twitter.com/LeftieStats/status/1194635049980743688?s=19

>According to Kantar, just 10% of 18-24 year olds say that they are definitely going to vote, compared to 75% of over-65s.

>This is a major reason for the difference between the weighted data (10pt Tory lead) and unweighted data (1pt Labour lead).

So depressing."

Unimportant, IMHO. The EU ""took note"" that Argentina disputes the status quo, which means what exactly?

The EU isn't going to support or accept any territorial change unless with democratic consent of the people living there (which would not be forthcoming). There is no chance that any diplomatic process is going to convince the EU to meddle in this, particularly as most of its members are also in a defensive military alliance with the UK. They're just going to listen politely and ignore it. It's not in the EU's interest to undermine a neighbouring country or provoke another conflict.

If the Argentine spins this as a symbolic victory, then it presumably does so for domestic audience. There is no reason why the UK government would consider it a defeat or feel the need to react, except for similar domestic political reasons. It has no conceivable diplomatic effect.

>It has no conceivable diplomatic effect.

You have to catch this stuff early, and defend your claim, or it becomes conventional wisdom real fucking quick.

There is only one basis for any territorial claim, and it is vested in the democratic will of the people living there. Nothing I have seen suggests any desire for change on that front.

There is simply no realistic scenario in which the EU member states will support any Argentinian claim to the islands.

If I conduct a poll on my street, and the majority vote for it, can we leave the UK too?

In theory: yes. In practice: no. A lot of people seem to do it as a joke."

Hello everyone. I have a question for all the immigration geeks out there. I long to see Scotland as it has been part of my family culture my entire life and something my father strongly identifies with. My question is; am I eligible for a British passport either directly through my Scottish grandparents or is my father already a duel citizen?

Dad was born in Australia in 1968 to 2 Scottish immigrants who never renounced their citizenship and married a year after his birth. He is not the travelling type and is allergic to bureaucracy so I have no clue how to further investigate whether or not he may be a duel citizen!

I would appreciate any shot in the dark at this point as the British embassy in Melbourne is for lack of a better word...Bawbag?

BONUS QUESTION: does Brexit change matters of passports and citizenship to Scotland?

Cheers

Your grandparents were not Scottish citizens because there is no such thing (for now). What you want to go and look-up is if you can claim British citizenship by ancestry. I think you can, but do check; you can deffo get an ""Ancestry visa"" if you have proof of everything.

Also, does Australia allow dual-nationality?

Brexit changes nothing WRT this for you.

So I made this its own posts, because it's been on my mind, and need to get it off my chest. Fully prepared for all the shit. I don't care. This needs to be said, and im sure others are saying it too, so sorry if I'm repeating.  It's an open letter, so ""you"" is anyone I've seen revelling or cheering on this policy in recent days. Because you need to be told, even if it does nothing.

&#x200B;

**So**

The basic fact is this ""issue""' of desperate people, in genuine fear for their lives (75%+ of claims are approved, so they're legitimate, whatever your fevered imaginatios say) arriving here by incredibly dangerous routes because safe ones aren't made possible for them, is not an issue of major significance to the UK's national security or economy. Our real issues: housing, economic stagnation, low wages are things that are experienced by, not caused by immigrants and other refugees as equally as they are everyone else apart from those well off enough to be insulated from them.

It is quite simply an issue that gets the worst element of the electorate very agitated and excited, and the more barbaric and cruel the ""solution"" offered, the more enthused they become. And so we've ended up here. Which is a very dangerous place to be, because I honestly think people revelling in and celebrating this policy aren't people who I can live in a society with, respect their differences of opinion and ""agree to disagree"". It's a line, and it's one thing to do your ""them coming over here"" speech to the pub, but it's another to be cheering on a policy which is utterly beyond all humanity, completely insane and besides the point so expensive as to make no economic sense whatsoever.

It means you don't care about anything other than seeing people you don't know but think are unworthy of treatment as human beings shown the most cruel treatment possible. At no benefit to anyone at all (this policy won't create a single job, won't raise wages or lower prices, won't build more houses or shorten waiting lists, improves public services or anything you seem to think the lack of it is causing). I think at heart you all know this, you know it won't stop anything, even the boats coming across the channel. I guarantee you it won't have more than a minor, temporary effect. If someone is willing to risk literally everything to do that, do you think this will be some kind of deterrent? It just shows so many of you have no idea what it is to genuinely experience fear and desperation of the level these people are in. No one would risk so much for so little prospective ""reward"". No, ""they"" don't get five star hotels and free houses and full salaries in benefits the moment they're picked up by the border force. I don't know how to keep telling you this, it just doesn't happen.

I beg you, find an asylum seeker and talk to them, ask an immigration lawyer, a community worker, literally anyone who works in the system. Life for these people is at best a precarious, insecure, for an indefinite time while your claim is assessed. You cannot work, build a life, and you find yourself surrounded by an environment where people who vote for this govt treat you with unbridled hostility and the bureaucracy processing you treats you as suspect until you can prove the danger you've fled is real, meaning you need to relive it over and over, telling it to official after official trying to poke holes in it. And say you're finally accepted as genuine, after all the interrogations, the tribunal system, the months or years of uncertainty, fear, treated as though you're illegal. Well you might get leave to remain, some official status, some right to live like everyone else. Then what? You get given a free house, and a job and your own GP and thousands in benefits and everything in your own language right?

No. of course you don't, You go into the same system as everyone. The same system that's overstretched, underfunded, dealing with too many in need and not enough to give.  And it's like this not because there's huge numbers of people like you causing the overstretch. It's because for decades the country has been run on the belief that people in need of comprehensive help, destitution, housing, support, help with complex needs of children or adult dependents, just are not worth allocating resources to. They don't matter. Not enough to do something about. And this is where these people, who've come from places and situations you cannot, remotely imagine the horror of, end up.  Yes, its much better than where they were. And yes, when they do get to a case officer who assesses them, just like everyone else, their needs and circumstances are accounted for in provision.  Just as someone fleeing a violent partner would be, or someone who'd lost everything and was homeless through no fault of their own. Its how the system works. It's imperfect, its chaotic sometimes, it doesn't always get it right. But the reason it's so badly stretched and creaking right now is because it has been allowed to get this way, again, because we have stopped thinking that those who need it or use it are worthy or valuable or deserving.

This attitude has spread over decades and its poisoned our society. There's lots of reasons for it. I don't really care why it's now the norm. I'm fed up with how it's ignorance means it's meant people think something which is obviously a problem caused by a pretty obvious set of people and policies is actually to be blamed on a tiny group of the most marginalised, powerless, terrified and precarious people that exist. If you want to be stupid and keep blaming problems on the wrong causes then fine, but when you start picking on the least responsible and demanding policies which brutalise them because of this stupid misallocation of blame, you're going beyond basic decency.  I've heard a lot of you all pretend and say ""we need to look after our own first"". But I bet you'd treat a non-refugee trying to find council accommodation because they were in absolute poverty, or fleeing domestic violence with the same contempt. I don't buy that fake concern for a second.  Because if you really did care in that way, you'd have done something to make sure we have adequate systems and resources ""for our own"". And nothing indicates to me that people like you have done or ever will do that.

Where you stand on this policy is a statement of who you are, and where we're going as a society from now on. If you're revelling in it, cheering on the suffering it's causing, because you really think it's a problem and this is a solution or just because you enjoy causing or seeing the kind of pain it causes those you dislike, then you're not worthy of respect or toleration. I don't care about your vote, or whether you represent ""the people"" or ""win elections"". That stuff matters up to the point where the policies are within the realm of humanity. This is outside that realm, and so whether you voted for it, whether the courts sanction it, whatever attempts there are to enforce it happen, they are wrong, and any attempts to stop it, to prevent us going down this road, whatever people decide is necessary to retain humanity in this situation, is legitimate.

I'm not calling for anyone to do anything, people should do whatever they feel right. I'm making no attempt at incitement to anyone or anything.

I've just seen enough of the ""send them all back"" brigade to feel the need to write this, because not enough people tell you what you are, not nearly enough of the time.  So this is just to tell you, this is beyond the pale, and you shouldn't expect, after this, for anyone to treat you with civility or respect any longer. You've forefited that. Shame on every one of you.

France is safe country. Crossing the channel is *extremely* dangerous. Arguments about them fleeing from terrible circumstances is a good argument for them seeking asylum in *a* safe country. But allowing those who risk their lives to stay in the UK is only rewarding them for doing so, stoking the pull factors for those who might contemplate doing the same.

I am all for having more safe routes of passage was mechanism for genuine asylum seekers to apply for asylum but I am also very happy to see this dangerous route closed down.

Also:

> Where you stand on this policy is a statement of who you are, and where we're going as a society from now on.

You should reflect on this statement. You are basically rejoicing in the fact you are politically polarised - that's not particularly cool

I mean...I think part of the point of this post is calling stuff like this out. 

You have casually just described a system where the UK never have to take any asylum seekers or refugees unless they can magically find a way to get directly to this country, and France and the EU has to take everyone. 

What OP is saying is - we don't believe you. I certainly don't believe you seriously care about these people and their safety. Its just a rhetorical excuse and justification for the cruelty of denying people help. 

 Its such an extreme position that has been smoothed over and excused. Basically saying that we should never have to take asylum seekers. Even if they are seeking asylum from countries we have personally blown up like Iraq or Afghanistan. Theres no legal way to get here. 

Its all very cruel in my opinion.

I really hate that there’s no way to discuss a complicated issue without the divisive personal attacks.

Insisting that OP doesn’t care about these people immediately torpedos the debate (agree with me or you are a monster).

I have a lot of empathy for asylum seekers and believe we should take our fair share. However the channel crossing route is incredibly dangerous and we have to stop the huge numbers of boats attempting it on the daily. 
What the solution is, I don’t know, but it’s certainly not rewarding them for taking the risk or shipping them to Rwanda.

“Rewarding then for taking the risk”. 

It’s not a “reward” to let them stay in this country. It’s just basic decency. Some of them want to be here because they have family or friends here. Some want to be here because they can speak the language and it’s already terrifying being uprooted from your home and having your whole life go up in flames without having the additional stress of not understanding what is going on because you can’t speak the language. Some of them want to come to the U.K. because they feel unsafe in the country they ended up in. 

There are no legal routes from Europe to the U.K.

If you want to stop people crossing illegally, you have to make legal routes. 

I was listening to the founder of the Say it Loud charity - a gay Ugandan man who came to the U.K. as a student and was tortured when he went back to Uganda because of his sexuality. He had six months on his U.K. visa so he just flew back to the U.K. and stayed as an illegal immigrant here for five years because the U.K. didn’t recognise asylum on the basis of sexuality in those days. 

People trying to come to the U.K. are not necessarily people unfamiliar with the country. Lots of people from countries like Syria used to be affluent enough to travel. Some might have been here for university. Some might still have links to the community and are pinning their hopes on that. Some might know people working in asylum charities here. Is it enough to risk your life? 

Maybe not for you, or for me. But living in a war zone can do strange things to your perception of risk. Let’s not forget these people are severely traumatised in many cases. 

They need help. Not moralising."

If you are going to Leave then why not go the whole hog.,"Why the Irish border will have to be enforced by the UK

So I've seen a lot of posts talking about the Irish border and how ""EU can chose to enforce it, we won't"" or that it can be solved in isolation between Ireland and the UK. Let me preface the post by emphasising that May embedded leaving ECU and EEA in A50 declaration, so those are off the table.

Both of those claims are completely wrong. See, the issue of border enforcement is a matter of international law, not the EU. It's actually WTO who forces the customs border enforcement, through its most favoured nation rule (MFN), which states:  
>Under the WTO agreements, countries cannot normally discriminate between their trading partners. Grant someone a special favour (such as a lower customs duty rate for one of their products) and you have to do the same for all other WTO members.

How to interpret this with border controls? Simply put, if you don't enforce border with a country, you've effectively set import tariffs to zero with that country, and by extension every other country. Now how does the ECU (and any other customs union) function without borders? By every country having the same trade deals and thus the customs are simplified by being made at the point of entry. The required discrimination of goods is still in effect. A consequence being that a customs union must negotiate and agree deals together.  

Some people are saying that a bilateral ROI-UK agreement could fix this. It technically could, if Ireland were to leave the ECU and then form another one with the UK. The other solution is the EU keeping NI in EEA and ECU, which was offered by the EU negotiators as ""the all-island solution"", but was voted down by the DUP, as it would move the customs border to the sea.  



tl:dr; UK must enforce the border by WTO rules; no border possible only by NI staying in ECU or Ireland leaving EU and entering a CU with UK

Or UK could also leave the WTO. If you are going to Leave then why not go the whole hog."

Our current time is a time of division in the Tory party. Johson faces opposition from those on the wet and Brexiteer sides of the party and there is rumoured to be a confidence vote at some point in the near future. 

With all this going on, I would like to ask this subreddit what you think is the best next move for the conservative party? Is it to keep Johnson? Replace him and if so who with?  

I think this is the most important question facing us as conservatives at the moment and I am keen to know your thoughts on how we continue from the present. 

I for one think we need an actual conservative in Downing street like Frost, Mogg, or Baker. Because in times of high inflation like the 70s and 80s, the way to get past that is fiscal conservatism which is a lesson we have learned from Margaret Thatcher. Such policies are simply not present in our current leader, whose chancellor declared this party to be one of ""high spending"". Also necessary is social conservatism namely, substantial reform in education to remove radical gender and race theories from primary school classrooms and bring about a general reinstatement of British values, namely Christianity, common law, and free speech; the triple foundation of this great country.   


But I shall leave it to you, what should we do?

I do really like Mogg personally, but I don't think he'd go down well with the general public. Ever since his 'Turkeys won't be able to stop christmas' speech about MP's staving off Brexit, I've been a fan of Geoffrey Cox.

I'm not sure what else could be done.","You still have friends on the continent

 After the UEFA football championship it’s become clear that the hate towards England has progressed a bit too far I’d say. And I say this as a Flemish Belgian. It’s gone beyond banter, not even France seems to get that much hate.

I say England because well some continental might say “I dislike the British”. If you’d ask that person “Does that mean you also dislike the Scottish and the Welsh?” the answer will almost always be “No.”. So by process of elimination that leaves England (sadly). So I hope nobody takes offense that I will only speak of the English and England where other people might speak of the British and Britain.

I feel it’s gotten to the point that people are revisioning history to just to hate on the English. This cannot stand. My own country Belgium literally could not have existed without England/Britain. England/Britain was pivotal of keeping out foreign powers out Flanders/Belgium in the 14th century, the 16th century, the 17th century, the 18th century, the 19th century and the 20th century.

So when people say English/British involvement in 1815, 1830, 1914 and 1944 doesn’t matter or worse that it had a negative effect, they are effectively saying Belgium as a nation shouldn’t exist. I’m quite content to not be a part of France or Prussia if I’m being honest. Neither am I of the opinion that the discrimination against non-French speakers in Flanders after the conquest of 1795 was a good thing (despite what some French Revolution/Napoleon fans say).

(Also the Netherlands probably wouldn’t have existed without England either. This has to do with a relatively free Flanders being an important stepping stone for the formation a the Dutch state for quite complex reasons.)

It might seem hard to believe these days but not every continental European dislike the English. Though Brexit and Boris Johnson (a very interesting figure that one) have undoubtedly damaged England’s reputation and you have lost some friends, you still do have friends!

As to why Brexit (and not to forget, the many years leading up to it) has damaged your reputation so much. Simple to explain really, humans are emotional beings and the media has indirectly framed Brexit like a rejection of other Europeans. For many Europeans Brexit has been perceived as British people saying other Europeans are not good enough for you.

Which is quite ridiculous of course, most Europeans are not political beasts so they tend to simplify. Also getting lumped together with immigrants from outside Europe was a bitter pill to swallow for many continentals who are also anti-immigration.

Also your media doesn’t help, those all caps headlines they do are quite obnoxious. ENGLISH MEDIA DEEMED TERRIBLE BY EUROPE. You probably know very well what I’m talking about. In Belgium we also have our tabloids but yours are on a whole other level. I wouldn’t be able to tell you about French and German tabloids because I can’t read those (without a lot of effort). Which is another thing, almost everybody knows English and thus almost everyone can read your own media which is being negative about its own country (England/Britain).

Then there’s also the countries who are naturally distrustful of England (cough … France … cough … Germany) and they happen to be pretty big countries. So they outnumber the smaller countries that might be positive towards England.

There’s also some Americans who feel like it’s payback time and who often take a snipe at England. So you are getting slammed from all sides really.

Despite all these factors that still does not mean England is hated as much as it seems. Us Belgians have seen more of French arrogance during the World Cup and the recent UEFA cup than any English arrogance. The French-speaking Belgians have always been well acquainted with French arrogance but the football cups have (re-)exposed it to Flemish Belgians as well. 

We are also well acquainted with Dutch arrogance. England probably ranks way below the Dutch and French on the arrogance scale. I’m sorry but French people don’t get to use the arrogant card against England.

For me personally I do have some concerns that the UK leaving the EU means it will grow even even closer to the United States and that English identity will be eroded. I was also very concerned about the no-deal Brexit because that would have been absolutely devasting for Flemish trade. But in the end leaving the EU was your decision and we continentals have to respect that.

I hope the relations between England and Flanders/Belgium continue to prosper as they have done so for many centuries.

Thanks for the kind comments. 

There does seem to be a lot of rampant xenophobia/anti English sentiment at the moment, and whilst I understand it in regards to how some fans have behaved at the Euros. It's got to the stage whereby every single English person has been bandied together amongst the idiots.

I find myself in a bit of a predicament given the current state of the country, cost of living and rental market. 

I'm a single father (33) living in Reading, originally from Ireland but have been here almost 14 years now. I have a decent wage of 50K plus performance bonus up to 7.5K but it's quite hard to achieve the whole bonus. 

Anyway, I'm steadily repaying debts accumulated in my stupidity during my 20s. As a single father, I have my daughter 50/50 split so don't have to pay maintenance, though I'm also not officially the primary caregiver, so I can't claim child benefits/tax credits, which is the only benefit taht I'm actually entitled to, which also means I don't qualify for social housing. 

My outgoings are over 2/3 of my take home pay, not including food, clothing, entertainment and my share for swimming and ballet.

Once everything is paid, I have less than 300/month and my life just feels completely empty and meaningless outside of my time with my daughter. I have no friends or support network, as my family are based in Luton and Ireland, friends in Bristol and one or two in London. I can't afford to get trains without sacrificing quality of life. I can't make attempts at socialising becasue I can't afford anything outside of food for my home. I can't find anywhere that's cheaper than my current 2 bed flat that isn't a mouldy hovel.

I remember thinking 10 years ago, if I was earning 50K I'd be living a good life, comfortable. What the actual F is going on?!

Continental Europe allows easier transport of food from areas that have a longer growing season than the UK.

Also maybe because the EU is an economical alliance which also has a EU market. This means we can find European food to be more diverse in markets.

Does anybody believe that IF Labour win the GE they will role back many of the changes the Tories have implemented over the years? 

Do you think Labour will role back many of purposed laws which attack free speech if they go through?

> Do you think Labour will role back many of purposed laws which attack free speech if they go through?

I doubt it, neither party truly support free speech

That's why I have been voting Green.

I know they won't win but at least I can sleep at night knowing I didn't participate in putting neither of these parties in power.

I can't imagine the Greens care much either. If they weren't against Nuclear I'd have a bigger inclination to vote for them though

This obviously cannot continue. We cannot have successive governments saying that they accept immigration has to come down sharply, while deliberately choosing to let it continue to increase as a matter of policy decision. Not after everything that has already happened. They have a choice -- they must either find a way to keep the economy going without depending on mass immigration, or they have to openly admit that immigration has to stay high. If the incoming Labour government says it will get it under control and then fails to do so then it will be punished severely at the subsequent general election. If it says it must stay high, the same thing will happen.

Have our politicians learned nothing from Brexit? For two decades they tried to ignore, downplay and deny that EU immigration was a problem, and eventually, due to democratic pressure being exerted by UKIP, the tories were forced to call an in/out referendum that most remainers thought they would win, thus finally putting the issue to bed and shutting up the ""small-minded xenophobes and racists"". Leave won, and then the tories won a landslide in order to ensure that brexit got done, which actually meant ""immigration got under control"". They then did the exact opposite, and in no small part because of this they are facing an extinction-level event at the coming election.

If the mainstream parties continue to lie to the public about this then the result, in the end, will be Reform UK *in government.*

Politicians have no right to rule in this way. They *serve the electorate*. If they fail to do so, they will be replaced.

The EU made a special exception for NI precisely because of the GFA.,"The SNP's star economist eviscerates the case for independence - 'You can’t really say that Brexit is the worst thing ever and then commit the biggest Brexit of all time'



**Article text**

He’s only gone and done it again. Mark Blyth, born in Dundee but now professor of international economics at the prestigious Brown University in the United States – the man who was wooed by the Scottish government to join its economic advisory council in 2021 in the obvious hope he would lend credibility (and maybe a touch of stardust) to its case for secession – has eviscerated the economic arguments for splitting from the UK.

As a quick recap, not long before Blyth took up his role formally advising the Scottish government, video emerged of him criticising the economic case for a Scottish exit from the UK on the basis it would be ‘the biggest Brexit in history’.

‘It’s [the UK] been together for over 300 years, so if pulling apart 30 years of economic integration with Europe is going to hurt, 300 is going to hurt a lot,’ he said.

What was meant to be a PR triumph for the SNP completely backfired. Blyth no longer advises the Scottish government. But perhaps because he has previously signalled his backing for secession despite being so honest and open about the downsides, the professor remains something of a darling of the nationalist movement.

Fast forward to this weekend and a video interview with Blyth from his US home was the star attraction at the ‘Scotonomics Festival of Economics’, a conference organised by separatists aiming to boost the economic case for secession. It was incredible. With his record for saying it like it is, you might have expected Blyth to drop the odd truth bomb here and there. Instead, he turned up with a 10-megaton truth nuke.

Let’s start with his repeating his warning that a Scottish exit from the UK will be like Brexit on steroids. ‘You can’t really say that Brexit is the worst thing ever and then commit the biggest Brexit of all time. Which is literally what this is,’ said Blyth.

He went on to say Scots have to think sensibly about what being independent really means:

*‘At the end of the day, as a small, open economy, which you then would be, you need to balance your imports and your exports over the long term or everyone thinks your currency is shite, and at that point they dump it, prefer payments in British pounds, and then you get a run on your foreign exchange, and you get a mini Argentina on your hands. So just because you’re independent, you can print bits of money, doesn’t mean anything if you don’t have things to back it up.’*

The SNP’s currency plan is for an independent Scotland to start off unofficially using sterling before moving to adopt a new Scottish currency as quickly as is feasible. Some nationalist supporters, including the organisers of the event, view the creation of a Scottish currency as the key to successfully cutting away. This is because they subscribe to modern monetary theory (MMT), which posits that countries in control of their own currency essentially do not have to worry about budget constraints so long as they keep inflation under control.

The MMTers also favour a newly independent Scotland refusing to accept a share of UK government debt. This is also something the SNP has hinted at using as a threat to provide the Scotland side with leverage in separation negotiations.

It is safe to say Blyth is not a fan of MMT or this approach to national debt. ‘MMT is closed economy Keynesianism. That’s all it is, and you don’t live in closed economies,’ he said, adding that if MMT applies anywhere it can only apply in the US, with its uniquely dominant economy that effectively gives it a form of insulation. ‘You’ll just get poor as shit,’ was his final analysis. 

He also added that a newly independent Scotland, effectively starting life by defaulting on its debt while launching a new currency, will have zero credibility in financial markets.

Then there was the argument often put by First Minister Humza Yousaf that cutting away from the UK will recreate Scotland as the rich Nordic-like nation it naturally should be. ‘Scotland, particularly in nationalist circles, loves to say that Scotland is a small open economy like the Nordic economies. That’s a bit like saying I’m a supermodel because I also have legs,’ said Blyth. Ouch, as they say.

A few other Blyth zingers were:

On currency again: ‘The entirety of currency is confidence. Confidence is not given by nationalist fiat.’

On the argument that becoming independent will improve energy security: ‘Your energy infrastructure is owned by asset managers… so how you going to improve that when you don’t even own it and you’ve no capacity to buy it. I mean I don’t do fantasy economics. I’m too old for this.’

On debt again: ‘If you think you’re starting off with a default, you’re dead already.’

Blyth, the author of anti-austerity book Angrynomics, was no doubt asked to be interviewed for the conference to provide the proceedings with a bit of star quality. He gave us much more than that. His honesty on the economic costs of independence is to be applauded. If only his audience of committed nationalists could be so open to reality.

Credit to the conference organisers for accepting dissenting voices. And that was a very dissenting voice. Ouch.

I’m sure someone will be along soon to point out that it’s about sovereignty and feelings, rather than money.

Aye, but people whose focus is sovereignty and feelings keep trying to assett that the financials add up. When they control the discussion, and independent scotland will be an economic superpower. When facts come into play, it's not about economics.


Ye cannae have yer cake and eat it



(Yet another brexit parallel)

Yes. And Brexit really was about sovereignty, and the economic case never did add up -- not in the short to medium term future anyway. The difference is that the UK is economically big enough to survive that process for the longer term, and Scotland isn't.

It's an interesting one, infrastructure and management is getting much cheaper especially for small nations and that trend is set to continue. They're well positioned for wind generation so likely to see growth in that area which could scale with data centres which suit the cold wet climate or SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) from sequestered or bioavailable carbon, their latitude places them as a good air-cargo hub between America and Europe (the shorter route due to a spherical earth). They're already a popular tourist destination and the global publicity of scxit would likely be a big draw for that yankee dollar and if they get in with the EU that'll be a load of euro tourists, and of course Brits will all flock there to see how it's going and assuming SNP follow through on their already partial decriminalisation of cannabis (stopped prosecution for small amounts) there will be lots of Brits going up to spend their hard earned pounds, probably converted to euros.

Their economic prospects aren't dire in the long term assuming they keep modernising and adapting, as is their plan. Reintroduction of the R&D tax credit for example could draw a lot of the types of businesses I described above, i don't think it'd make them a powerhouse but they could be a comfortable small country.

If they were to join the EU then they would have to build a customs border between Gretna and Berwick and then attempt to negotiate a trade deal with the rump UK (via the EU). All the positives you have listed won't come close to cancelling out that massive negative. They would still be at the mercy of Westminster, just in a different way.

Yeah, in a slightly ironic way Brexit has made Scottish independence near impossible imo. 


Scotland basically has a choice between a hard border with England and Wales, or continuing one with the EU. 


Could they manage to get a ""best of both worlds"" NI deal? I doubt it. 

A hard border is a difficult sell but at least doesn't involve messing with an international peace deal (i.e. GFA)

That is what would make any open-border deal impossible. The EU made a special exception for NI precisely because of the GFA."

Back in 2007, Romania and Bulgaria were added to the EU as a package, meaning both at the same time.

Therefore, if you vote against any of them, both can’t join Schengen. 

A month ago Romania asked for the package thingy to be removed, but Bulgaria refused, therefore we are stuck with each other and we are at the mercy of Austria and the Netherlands who both refused us on political reasons unrelated to the Schengen requirements.

Brexit supporters are getting very angry.  They were led to believe that Brexit literally meant 'no deal'.  Just vote out, then leave and use WTO rules for trade.  

However, they didn't know that the Government would then spend years negotiating their way out.  That you can't just up sticks and leave without throwing a considerable amount of businesses under the bus.  Many more used it as a vote against mass immigration, not realising that mass immigration will continue regardless of Britain's in or out position.  Brexiters must be shaking their heads wondering 'what the hell did we vote for'?

I think it is without question that if a second referendum were to take place, remain would win resoundingly.  They won't even have to change anyone's mind.  If a second referendum were to take place, millions of Brexit voters would simply not vote at all.  Because they were sold a dodgy bag of goods.  The pro Brexit bunch said they'd have all this extra money, that no businesses would suffer, that we would get new trade deals. 

What happened?  The conservatives ruined any hope of trade deals by first snubbing Trump, who despite what you think of him, represents the largest (by far) trading nation in the world.  Boris Johnson who then went to all the massive emerging markets in Asia and took the piss out of them, insulting every country he visited.  They all hardened their stance on EU trade immediately after this total prick destroyed any hope of meaningful trade deals.  The Conservatives then went harder on their 'privatise everything' stance and drew up plans to sell off even more of the NHS after Brexit.  Not only that but plans to privatise swathes of Prisons, schools etc.  

Brexit was a media manipulation exercise on behalf of the British financial institutions who felt threatened because the EU wanted to relocate the finance of the EU to Luxembourg.  That is the only reason this pro Brexit thing went ahead.

I voted for Brexit.  I was tricked, manipulated by all the voices promising us so much.  Now I learn that Brexit will for a fact send Britain into recession.  There is no way on earth I'd vote for Brexit tomorrow.  I'd vote remain.  Oh and I'd vote Labour, even if they replaced Jeremy Corbyn with Diane Abbott I'd still vote Labour.

> Some people are just utterly fed up of talking about our relationship with Europe

Yes. These are predominantly people who voted Leave and can't bare to face the huge economic and social damage their vote has done to this country. Rather than admit they were wrong, they try to shutdown any and all dialogue on the subject.

It is not just Leave voters. 

I voted Remain, but have no wish to re-open that particular argument after it's all that has been discussed for the past seven years. Hence my initial comment - I was talking about myself. 

There are plenty of Remain voters that share my view; that while we may have preferred to stay a member, we also recognise that there is other political conversations that have been put off for years that *desperately* need to happen. 

And those conversations are not being blocked by Leavers; they're being blocked by the Rejoiners who refuse to talk about *anything* else, and who somehow link Brexit back to every problem currently existing in the UK. Would things be better if we were in the EU? Of course; but the fight to do that will consume all the political time for so long that nothing else gets done, and there's other things that are more important to look at. 

We fought the battle, and we lost. We need to fight the next battle, not try to redo the last one until we get the result we wanted.

Right, let's get one thing straight. Those that voted Leave did so through an inability to engage in logical debate, or acceptance that they don't have the capability to engage in complex issues of foreign policy. Their ignorance and lack of mental accuity was weaponised against them to the huge detriment of this country and themselves. [And don't even start with that""legitimate concerns over immigration"" bullshit.]

Now, refusing to learn that lesson condemns us to a future where ignorance and xenophobia is allowed to drive future policy making and political leadership. So, until it is driven home and accepted what a damaging decision brexit was, we can't hope to make better decisions for the future. Folks who voted remain who cave in to letting ignorant leave voters dictate what is acceptable and is not acceptable to discuss are a huge part of the problem. Yes, I am talking about you.

>Those that voted Leave did so through an inability to engage in logical debate, or acceptance that they don't have the capability to engage in complex issues of foreign policy.

No they didn't. 

This arrogant approach that assumes anyone who disagreed with you *must* be an ignorant moron who just doesn't understand foreign policy as well as you do is why we lost the vote in the first place. If we can't even understand why people might legitimately consider voting Leave, how were we ever going to win them over? 

Look, I voted Remain because I'm a huge proponent of free trade; but I've had enough conversations with Scottish nationalists on here to realise that the economic impact is not the only factor that people make their decisions on. 

And just because those other issues are less important to me personally, doesn't make other people wrong for thinking that they're important considerations. Especially when I can easily envision situations where I *wouldn't* prioritise the economy (I wouldn't trade living in a liberal democracy for an authoritarian tyranny, even if that could be proved to definitely result in massive economic growth, for example).

> This arrogant approach that assumes anyone who disagreed with you *must* be an ignorant moron who just doesn't understand foreign policy as well as you do is why we lost the vote in the first place.

It's not that they disagree with me that makes them ignorant morons (though sure, you could have levelled that accusation before the vote).

What makes them ignorant is the reality we have experienced since the vote. The economic harms and social damage that has resulted from brexit, and that was continuously pointed out would result before the vote, is what demonstrates they are ignorant. They voted for brexit, claiming those warnings were project fear. They were ignorant of the facts and unable to understand the complexities of what they were voting for. Contact with reality has proven this, the ignorance of voting for leave is no longer debatable.

Justify using actual data (not projections) relative to France and Germany which show a large disparity in economic performance."

This isn't new at all.","Brexit has turned into Radio Yerevan

""Radio Yerevan"" is a term for a kind of joke which was popular in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc in general. They took the form of a fictional answer given by Radio Yerevan to a question posed by a listener. It was typical to have a ""yes, but"" or a ""in principle yes, but"" format, with the latter part utterly contradicting the first one. An example would be ""Can a low-ranking party member criticize a high-ranking party member?"", with the answer ""In principle yes, but very sad for low-ranking party member"".

The reality of Brexit, when compared to the promises made by Brexiters, follows that format closely. Examples would be:

""Can the UK now have trade deals of its own?"" ""Yes, but there is no guarantee that the new trade deals will be better than the ones the UK had as a member of the EU"".

""Is the UK now in control of immigration?"" ""Yes, but that also means that there are tens of thousands of nurses, lorry drivers and hospitality staff missing.""

""Did Brexit get done?"" ""Yes, but negotiations about the relationship are ongoing and will continue to go on for as long as there is an economic relationship.""

""Can the UK now make its own rules?"" ""Yes, but if the UK wants to keep the market access it has under the TCA, it can not diverge too much.""

""Can British Citizens still live and work in the EU?"" ""Yes, but only if this in compliance with the rules set by individual EU member states"".

I wonder at which point the contrast between the sunlit uplands that were promised and the rather bleak reality will have political consequences. I occasionally delve into the cess pit that is the comment section of the Express or the Mail, and it is evident that the tone has shifted. There is still a faction that would want to see the UK abandon all treaties, but they are no longer a majority.

The issue is that the government, if it cares at all about farmers, has two options that make any logical sense.


The first is subsidise farmers and in return they follow regulations.


The second is you don't subsidise farmers, but you cut regulations and let them get on with it.


What the government is actually doing is a double pincer of fucking farmers by banning all useful chemicals, taxing inputs to death and making them follow ridiculous reporting regimes while cutting subsidy. Which basically means in the long run, farms will fold. This coupled with net zero policies basically means all farms will end up as solar plants in a decade or two

I want to move to Wales, or at least near enough to visit extensively. I’m not worried about the legalities of it, I’m a nurse and so visas wouldn’t be terribly hard to come by in the UK. But I wonder how the Welsh view foreigners? I speak the Welsh that Duolingo can give me, and I want to go there because of a fascination with Llwelyn the great spawned by the Welsh Princes trilogy. I just know that there are places here in the US that put up with tourism to get bye but hate transplants and I wonder if Wales wouldn’t be the same?

I can't speak for all of Wales but i would welcome you with open arms. I have a very positive view of anyone who wants to join us in creating a fair, sustainable country 🙏✊🌟

I just didn’t know if there was a mindset of Welsh history being erased by an influx of foreigners on Welsh soil, of that makes sense? I know if I stuck to the south and the capitol it’d be one thing but I’d love to be in gwynedd

We only have this attitude towards colonially minded monoglot ignorants that are typically English retirees or English families moving here for the cheap houses relative to the south of England. They move here, and then claim the language is dead, Wales is just England, why do our kids have to learn it in school etc.

Good. There are critical staff shortages in every industry right now and we desperately need migrants to replace the ones turfed out by Brexit.

And keep houses prices up

Where do you think one of the critically short staffed areas is? House building.

If only we have a ready supply of young workers each year… we could call them school leavers and skill them up in industry….

And you train each young person to be a doctor, a nurse, a bricklayer, a plumber, a fruit picker and a carer because there are more jobs than people to do them.

By the way having more training places available or paying higher salaries for menial jobs doesn't increase the number of young people available to train or do those jobs.

I really don't get why Labour have taken the stance they have. The EU are throwing a life line to the young people of the UK in what is, in reality, a gesture of good will. Why wouldn't they accept it, all they've actually agreed to so far is to negotiate a deal, why not try?

Because the pattern of inward UK migration from 2002-2016 was mainly young and healthy graduates, whereas British outward migration was mainly 40-70 year olds (I’m in the exception in that I migrated to Germany at 18 for studies and to France at 22 for work).

So the Labour thinking is that accepting this creates pressures on British youth unemployment without corresponding real opportunities for British kids. 

And I’m still annoyed about New Labour stopping mandatory foreign languages to 16 years old in 2003.

So what age can people drop foreign language classes in the Uk? Until 16 seems like the bare minimum. Unless I read that wrong

13 or 14. There’s no mandatory GCSE in modern languages. So basically 3 years of French, German or Spanish. 

I went to a comp in a small town in the UK, kids today won’t have have the same opportunities I had in the 90s because they’ll self-select out of languages at too young an age to realise the opportunities that come with it.

What?! Wow I am shocked by that. I really thought ye lads did a language for your GCSEs similar to the junior certificate in Ireland. We do a foreign language and Irish as subjects. I think you can drop the European continent language after 16 but you at least will keep with Irish. I did a science degree but needed Irish or a European language in my final exams to get into my course

The Rt F*cking Honorable Charles Clarke’s responsible for that fuck-up…

Pass rates and grades went up over night, as half of kids dropped languages in 2004.  

14 of us took German to A level in 1996. Today that class alone would be 0.5% of the entire British population taking German. 

Absolutely nuts, most of the benefit of learning languages is cultural - meeting other people and chatting to them on their terms in their language. Helps with all kinds of discussions/negotiations later, shared stories etc.

That’s very disappointing, mostly for the cultural exchange you mentioned. I’m terrible at languages but it’s a fantastic skill and opens doors. No offence but the British system is seen as easy compared to our schooling in Ireland. I can kinda see why people say that now to be very honest"

Scotland,comment,Tories,kk3usu2,jasonpswan,,"If we taxed wealth as opposed to average earners we'd be able to fund a lot more than this.

People in the 28-43k range are standard working people, being asked to pay more than everyone else for the same shite services.","Tory tax claims about Scotland demolished by Westminster fact check



Yeah, so what this actually means is if you live in Scotland and earn £28K or less you'll pay £22 less tax in Scotland than in England. If you earn more then you pay more tax in Scotland, but it's not £20 it goes a lot higher. It certainly doesn't balance out.

The National does actually say this if you read the whole article. And it's pretty much a 50/50 split between people who pay a tiny, tiny amount less tax and people who pay signficiantly more tax. So while it's technically true it's really quite misleading.

100% correct, I earn over that and pay more than my colleagues south of the border. Between taxes, NI and student loans I get shafted before any money hits my account.

Taxes as a whole need re-evaluated, not just in terms of how much we pay, but in terms of what we pay for and the value we get from that.

Just to ask, what student loans? Education would be free for a resident of Scotland

Education is free, but I had to take out a student loan to be able to live. I don't mind repaying it, albeit it pisses me off that there are many people who'll never have to repay it due to their lower earning potential, which is often linked to them doing degrees which they then don't utilise in their career.

So to summarise, you are still better off than living in England since you'd be paying back loans for education as well. Either way you look at it, Scotland taxation is a net benefit

It's not a net benefit to anyone getting hit with a higher tax rate. We need to tax wealth and the people at the top, not people earning a bawhair over the median salary.

The free education which allows you to get the job able to pay over the median rate isn't a benefit caused by the higher tax rate?

If we taxed wealth as opposed to average earners we'd be able to fund a lot more than this. People in the 28-43k range are standard working people, being asked to pay more than everyone else for the same shite services."

This summary of US negotiating objectives for EU trade makes for an interesting read - not in terms of those negotiations, which are dead on arrival on this basis, but for the country who's next - the UK... 1/ https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/01.11.2019_Summary_of_U.S.-EU_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf


Number one negotiating objective - the US trade balance in goods. That sound you hear is 99% of US economists and supporters of free trade weeping at the economic illiteracy of it... 2/

> **Trade in Goods - Improve the U.S. trade balance and reduce the trade deficit with the EU.**

The US has a small goods trade surplus with the UK so we may be ok. But they're not even trying to pretend this is balanced any more - US expects duty-free on textiles but doesn't expect to give it... 3/

> **Secure duty-free access for U.S. textile and apparel products and seek to improve competitive opportunities for exports of U.S. textile and apparel products while taking into account U.S. import sensitivities.**

On agriculture this is about as clear a statement in support of hormone-treated beef and everyone's favourite chlorinated chicken that you're going to find. Wonder if Liam Fox has been briefed on this? 4?

> **Eliminate practices that unfairly decrease U.S. market access opportunities or distort agricultural markets to the determent of the United States, including**
>
> * Non-tariff barriers that discriminate against U.S. agricultural goods; and

This one will be fun, the US want reciprocal de minimis level for imports to be free of duties and domestic taxes. The US de minimis level is $800. I'm sure the Treasury will be delighted with this one. 5/

> **Provide for streamlined and expedited customs treatment for express delivery shipments,
cluding for shipments above any de minimis threshold. Provide for simplified customs
ocedures for low value goods and a more reciprocal de minimis shipment value.**

As I said the US are not even pretending they want to make this fair. Rules of Origin must be biased so more products are made in the US. 6/

> **Rules of Origin:**
>
> * Develop rules of origin that ensure that the benefits of the Agreement go to products genuinely
de in the United States and the EU.
>
> * Ensure that the rules of origin incentivize production in the territory of the Parties, specifically in
e United States

This is pretty much requesting the EU dismantle their system for voluntary standards and conformity assessment. Not going to happen of course. But what about when they come knocking on the UK's door? 7/

> **Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT):**
> 
> * Require application of decisions and recommendations adopted by the WTO TBT Committee that apply to standards, conformity assessment, transparency, and other areas.
> 
> * Include strong provisions on transparency and public consultation that require the publication of drafts of standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, allow stakeholders in other countries to provide comments on those drafts, and require authorities to address significant issues raised by stakeholders and explain how the final measure achieves the stated objectives.
> 
> * Ensure national treatment of conformity assessment bodies without conditions or limitations and encourage the use of international conformity assessment systems, including mutual recognition arrangements.
> 
>* Obtain commitments that the EU will not foreclose export opportunities to the United States with respect to third-country export markets, including by requiring third countries to withdraw or limit the use of any relevant standard, guide, or recommendation developed in accordance with the TBT Committee Decision.
> 
> * Establish an active TBT Chapter Committee that will discuss bilateral and third-party specific trade concerns, coordination of regional and multilateral activities, regulatory cooperation, and implementing Good Regulatory Practices.

In services, the EU should remove all restrictions but the US can keep theirs... 8/

> **Trade in Services**
>
>* Secure commitments from the EU (including its Member States) to provide fair and open conditions for services trade, including through:
>
>  * Rules that apply to all services sectors, including rules that prohibit:
>
>    * Discrimination against foreign services suppliers;
>
>    * Restrictions on the number of services suppliers in the market; and
>
>    * Requirements that cross-border services suppliers establish a local presence.
>
>  * Specialized sectoral disciplines, including rules to help level the playing field for U.S. delivery services suppliers in the EU; and

>
> * Where any exceptions from core disciplines are needed, the negotiation, on a negative list basis, of the narrowest possible exceptions with the least possible impact on U.S. firms.
>
> - Retain flexibility for U.S. non-conforming measures, including U.S. non-conforming measures for maritime services.

Procurement. Open up the EU market. Preserve all US restrictions including state level procurement, specific programmes, and broad exceptions 9/

> Exclude sub-federal coverage (state and local governments) from the commitments being negotiated. Keep in place domestic preferential purchasing programs such as:
>
> * Preference programs for small businesses, women and minority owned businesses (which includes Native Americans), service-disabled veterans, and distressed areas;
>
> * “Buy America” requirements on Federal assistance to state and local projects, transportation services, food assistance, and farm support; and
>
> * Key Department of Defense procurement.
>
> Maintain broad exceptions for government procurement regarding:
>
> * National security;
>
> * Measures necessary to protect public morals, order, or safety;
>
> * Protecting human, animal, or plant life or health; and

Thanks @KimDriver11 for pointing out this section on Israel... 10/

>**With respect to commercial partnerships:**
>
>* Discourage actions that directly or indirectly prejudice or otherwise discourage commercial activity solely between the United States and Israel;
>
>* Discourage politically motivated actions to boycott, divest from, and sanction Israel;
>
>* Seek the elimination of politically motivated nontariff barriers on Israeli goods, services, or other commerce imposed on Israel; and
>
>* Seek the elimination of state-sponsored unsanctioned foreign boycotts of Israel, or compliance with the Arab League Boycott of Israel.

Conclusion: US Trade was never generous, but they knew trade was a negotiation for mutual gain. No more, this is simply a 'me, me, me' list, to be ignored by the EU. But what will the UK do when faced with a similar document? /end


Should be more clear really - on the basis of these negotiating objectives there's no way any self-respecting country including the UK could possibly start trade negotiations with the US. Another problem for the UK Government.


Incidentally USTR still has the original TTIP objectives live on their website in case you want to compare and contrast. The TTIP objectives are expressed as reciprocal unlike the new EU objectives... https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2014/March/US-Objectives-US-Benefits-In-the-TTIP-a-Detailed-View

To be honest looking at this in more detail we'd be mad to accept it and I doubt we will. I reckon there's gonna be a lot of trade agreements that exclude America moving forward. If as looks likely brexit is gonna collapse then we can join the EU in telling trump to go fuck himself.

Yep, that is 10000000% correct. Cameron will go down as one of the worst PMs in history.

I'd have said worst but he seems to have inspired a competition :(

Not really fair on May. For all her flaws, give her credit where it's due: she truly believes she's doing what the country needs.

This isn't about her ego, because the country hates her. This isn't about her party, because at this point any loyalty she had to them has been extinguished.

She genuinely believes that her solution is a palatable softer Brexit which maintains the integrity of our democracy while minimising the damage our choice might cause.

I think she's wrong, but she's far from the worst. She's simply being hit with the fallout of a very poor decision by her predecessor.

## SUMMARY

**New thread for the afternoon because Reddit breaks with posts that have a lot of comments, sorry**

As predicted by last night's exit poll, the **Conservative Party** have **[won a large majority](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50765773)** in this year's General Election, after taking a large amount of seats from Labour. The Tories' win is Labour's greatest defeat since 1935 with a *swing* of 47 seats and an 87 seat majority.

Speaking at his seat declaration, **Jeremy Corbyn** [announced](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50766114) that he will not lead the party into the next election, but he will stay on as leader during a ""process of reflection"". It has not yet been announced when there will be a leadership election for the party.

The Liberal Democrats leader **Jo Swinson** lost her seat, meaning that under party rules she would not be able to continue leading the party. She [has announced](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50771123) she is stepping down as leader. Sir Ed Davey and Baroness Sal Brinton will be acting leaders for the party.

The **SNP** did very well, taking most of the seats in Scotland. While in Northern Ireland, the **DUP** has lost several seats, including their (ex-)Westminster leader Nigel Dodds' seat.

### RESULT

The thing is with Sunak, when you don't hear him for a while (like over the Christmas break), you start to think, maybe if he gets some luck and a bad Labour campaign, maybe he could do better than expected at the next election. 

Then when you hear him speak again, you remember what an uncharismatic and unconvincing man he is. 

Every time I have doubts over a Labour win, I just think of Sunak on the TV every day during the campaign losing credibility every time he appears.

I wonder if he will attend any of the TV 'debates' during the election campaign.

I hope they do the ones with questions from members of the public so we see a chippy Sunak telling struggling people that they are wrong actually and he has actually done loads for them.... actually."

ID cards work in Europe fine, and are sensible in a country where a lot of people have zero photo ID. 

I don’t understand the problem except the usual foil hatted arguments, and the usual libertarian suspects

>except the usual foil hatted arguments

""Anyone who disagrees with me is crazy""

Get bent lmao, what kind of shit-faith argument is this?

It’s mad we don’t have a centralised ID system- if you don’t have a driving licence, or passport, stuff can be unreasonably difficult. That’s the argument for. 

The arguments against are either libertarian small government, or civil liberties. The latter are a genuine concern, but that’s what legislation is for. Other countries manage this, and in my opinion the problems are solvable, and the benefits are much more plentiful. 

Why are you against them?

>It’s mad we don’t have a centralised ID system- if you don’t have a driving licence, or passport, stuff can be unreasonably difficult. That’s the argument for.

De facto no, we don't. But we have several that fill the same function fine using two things that most people get anyways. And if you didn't there are plenty of schemes to get a card with your ID on it that're endorsed by the police et al.

>The arguments against are either libertarian small government

Screw you lmao. Or if you want we can go down this bad faith road, I'm a shithead so I don't mind.

>or civil liberties. The latter are a genuine concern

Weird to say that after saying the opposite:

>I don’t understand the problem except the usual foil hatted arguments, and the usual libertarian suspects

Yeah looks like you're totally down with the civil liberties argument. Do they fall under libertarianism or ""foil hatted arguments""?

>but that’s what legislation is for. Other countries manage this

Other countries aren't the UK. Under a system with PR or more political accountability *maybe* I'd be more okay with it. Here all it takes is the tories getting voted in.

>and in my opinion the problems are solvable

No they're not? How do you prevent any future authoritarians misusing this system?

>Why are you against them?

Because I'm even against the current system of identification, it's fucking racist and classist. Having a more centralised *more* required version that would absolutely be tied to being allowed to vote (and thus having a legal method to effectively disenfranchise people) is absolutely out of the question for me.

I don’t see how it’s bad faith to point out that one side against ID cards are libertarian small government proponents, such as David Davies. 

The other main side against are those concerned with civil liberties. 

That isn’t a contradiction on my part, that’s setting out the two main camps against. 

There are scores of people without any photo ID- recent immigrants, old people, homeless people, poor people. I see ID cards as enfranchising them, and making life easier for everyone. 

The UK isn’t any different from any other country when it comes to needing its citizens to occasionally prove who they are. I also don’t follow that PR would make governments less authoritarian, and we aren’t an authoritarian country. If at some point we become one, we’ll all have far bigger problems than everyone having photo ID.

>I don’t see how it’s bad faith to point out that one side against ID cards are libertarian small government proponents, such as David Davies.

It is when you lump them in with ""foil hatted arguments"". Same way you're now trying to make it seem like being against them is a Tory idea by highlighting one tory who is against it. Guilt by association.

>The other main side against are those concerned with civil liberties.  
  
That isn’t a contradiction on my part, that’s setting out the two main camps against.

Such a walk back from ""foil hatted arguments"" though isn't it?

>There are scores of people without any photo ID- recent immigrants, old people, homeless people, poor people. I see ID cards as enfranchising them, and making life easier for everyone.

How the fuck can you make this argument? Take a hypothetical homeless person under a country that requires ID by law, sure if they get that ID they could vote (just like RN they could get ID, just not a specific for purpose ID card). But what happens when they can't afford it -due to y'know, being homeless- and some police officer asks them for ID?

>The UK isn’t any different from any other country when it comes to needing its citizens to occasionally prove who they are.

And yet somehow, the current system is working for that.

> I also don’t follow that PR would make governments less authoritarian

Lmao. You really can't see how PR -a system that requires more co-operation between parties- wouldn't lead to less authoritarianism than FPTP - a system that hands one party near complete control of the country? Fine, that's on you.

>and we aren’t an authoritarian country

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic\_backsliding\_by\_country#United\_Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding_by_country#United_Kingdom)

Also worth noting we're on our fourth unelected tory PM.

I don't know which bit of two main arguments against- one from people opposed to big government, I. E David Davies,  and one from people worried about civil liberties you're confused by? I'm not lumping them together, I'm clearly setting then out as two sperate entities.

The current system doesn't work for everyone, including those groups I mention.

You also seem confused by the parliamentary system- we vote for a constituency MP. The party with the most of them forms a government. We don't elect a PM. There's an argument to had about mandates, but that isn't de facto a sign of an authoritarian state.

>I don't know which bit of two main arguments against- one from people opposed to big government, I. E David Davies,  and one from people worried about civil liberties you're confused by? I'm not lumping them together, I'm clearly setting then out as two sperate entities.

Again, what a walk-back from ""foil hatted arguments"". Problem is when in the same breath as that statement you include ""foil hatted arguments"", you're effectively lumping them in together. You can argue that but it's just how language works.

>You also seem confused by the parliamentary system- we vote for a constituency MP. The party with the most of them forms a government. We don't elect a PM. There's an argument to had about mandates, but that isn't de facto a sign of an authoritarian state.

""we can't be authoritarian, the system is working as intended"". I'm not ""confused"" about it, I just don't equate legalism with being anti-authoritarian. That is to say; just because the system is working as intended doesn't mean it's not authoritarian.

>but that isn't de facto a sign of an authoritarian state.

Four unelected prime ministers in a decade isn't a sign of an authoritarian state. Say it out loud, see how it sounds.

I don’t know if you’ve ever had commas and the word ‘and’ explained to you? 

The civil liberty argument is pretty foil hat given the amount of personal data we allow companies and governments to have, and the other argument is libertarian. 

As I say, I don’t understand your confusion. 

And four PMs is at best careless, and at worst completely mental, but it isn’t authoritarian. If one had taken over with the military and implemented a police state, you’d have a point.

>I don’t know if you’ve ever had commas and the word ‘and’ explained to you?

Oh yeah tell me, getting at my grammar is great for your argument. Tell you what, I'll leave a bunch of these here and you can just put them wherever you like: ..........................................,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/03/independent-scotland-would-let-asylum-seekers-work-says-snp-immigration-depopulation

This article is from last Friday but I only saw it today. Whilst these are theoretically laudable and humane aims, I’d argue they’re the aims of an established and economic powerhouse of a country, rather than the unknown reality that would be an independent Scotland. Does anyone else look around and wonder where the money to fund this would actually come from when NHS Scotland is clearly on it’s knees (if you don’t think it is you clearly aren’t on any waiting lists), so many services have been cut, and household poverty is at an all time high? Why can’t an independent Scotland focus on making a country where young Scots will want to live, work and have families in? If governments made existing easier; the birth rate would sort itself out. 

Rather than the SNP encouraging rampant immigration when we already have underfunded and overstretched services and a dearth of homes for those of us who already live here, why not focus on making Scotland a sustainable green country where the focus is on quality of life and landscape rather than economic GDP? 

I guess I’m trying to articulate that I’m not sure the SNP’s utopian, naive, and idealistic vision for Scotland is one that I share, the lunatics seem to be in charge of Both the asylums in London and Edinburgh, and it leaves me in a massive quandary as to who to vote for.

(ETA: The right to work is something I agree Asylum seekers should be able to do, and I’m aware the asylum system in the UK needs a major revamp to be fairer and more efficient.)

(EATA: It’d also be nice if this idea could be discussed without people immediately being sorted into the clichéd diametrically opposed stances of ‘racist’ or ‘bleeding heart liberal’.)

I think the SNP is having the wrong conversation at the wrong time. It's not for Shirley Ann Sommerville - or the SNP - to decide what immigration policy will be in an independent Scotland, that will be the decision of the elected government of an independent Scotland which may be the SNP but which equally may not be the SNP. The point the SNP should be making is that Immigration Policy - like everything else in an independent Scotland - will be fully the decision of Scottish politicians, made with the best interests and agreement of the Scottish public to suit the needs of Scotland and Scotland alone. That is the point they should be driving home in EVERY policy area.

In a representative democracy, the representative shares their policies, and they carry it out.

So she very much is entitled to share her her views on government."

One of the central pillars of the Brexiter movement has long been to secure an FTA with the United States after the UK leaves.

On paper, it does make some sense as the U.S. is still the world’s economic superpower, with the potential for British firms to preferential access to its market, and for a consumer boon in the form of cheaper prices on goods, and Brexiters have often stressed that they will off-set the costs of Brexit through new FTAs they claim wouldn’t be possible inside the EU. It would also be a hugely symbolic victory for the UK to do what the EU failed to achieve with TTIP.

However, the primer of what the U.S. will demand for an FTA, namely that the UK will have to align more with American as opposed to European standards and regulations, particularly on food, have created potential political difficulties for an UK-US trade deal to take shape and could lead to significant public backlash in the polls should the Tories press too hard to sign such an trade agreement.

For starters, aligning more closely with the U.S. will make negotiating an FTA with the EU even more difficult as they have insisted that the “deep and comprehensive trade deal” that Brexiters stress to support will require level playing field provisions on taxation, state aid, labour laws and the environment. The EU and the U.S. for some time have been competitors in terms of regulatory alignment, and the former have little incentive to let the UK move more to the American sphere. Not to mention British exporters in sectors such as agriculture will find it harder to export their products to the EU.

If the UK does align more closely to the U.S., it’s unlikely the EU will grant them that “Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement” and will instead likely be a basic, bog-standard FTA on tariffs and goods, nothing more, that’s just barely better than WTO terms.

Furthermore, Trump’s actions the past few months, from his comments about having the NHS “on the table” in trade negotiations, to the recent saga of Sir Darroch and the leaked cables, is making the prospect of aligning more closely with the U.S. post-Brexit increasingly more toxic politically. One person I know stated that Trump and Boris’ support of his administration will end up fueling the Remain/Rejoin movement in the future as it will allow them to portray Brexit as having reduced the UK to being a vassal state of the U.S, completely discrediting Euroskepticism as a political force. A line that becomes especially more poignant given the Trump administration’s saber-rattling against Iran and their attempts to pressure the UK into supporting their position.

It was after all, Blair’s support for Bush during the Iraq War that led to his downfall, and the beginning of the end for New Labour. Whose to say the same can’t happen  Boris, the Conservative Party, and Euroskepticism in general.

However, some say that if the UK leaves with No Deal or fails to secure a “deep and comprehensive free trade agreement” and can only get a bog-standard FTA with the EU, the public may very well have no choice but to reluctantly accept a UK-U.S. trade deal and align Britain to the American regulatory sphere in order to offset the costs of decoupling from the single market. Thus mitigating the potential for any voter backlash.

This is of course, complicated by Pelosi’s statements that there will be no UK-U.S. FTA approved by Congress without the GFA being protected by the backstop, and the Democrats presently control the House and have no incentive to approve an FTA that would erode the U.S.’ soft power, alienate relations with Ireland and the EU, and potentially reignite political violence in Northern Ireland, just so Trump has something shiny to flaunt to his base during the coming American presidential election. To say nothing of angering Irish-American voters as well.

However, there has been talk of Boris being open towards an referendum in NI over whether to accept the backstop. As well as the prospect of Boris calling a GE during his honeymoon period to take advantage of the Remainer split between Labour and the Lib Dems and win an majority with an BXP electoral pact. Then he can shift to an NI-only backstop, establish divergence as the basis of the UK-EU future relationship, and clear the way to sign an UK-US trade deal.

And if that happens, the prospect of the UK ever rejoining the EU could become quite slim as it will be economically and politically very difficult to shift back to the European regulatory sphere when the UK is now deeply aligned with the U.S. and cannot afford to break it, politically and economically. Even if they tried, the EU may very well bar the UK from rejoining, citing De Gaulle’s rationale that Britain’s political, economic and social model is too divergent and incompatible with Europe.

So question for this evening, will there be an UK-U.S. FTA after Brexit? Explain why or why not.

Bonus question: If there is an UK-U.S. trade deal, how will it affect UK politics going forward on both the domestic level as well as foreign policy?

From the news stories we’re getting it seems like Tory MPs and even Sunak see the writing on the wall now. Probably a process that happened since around Xmas. I’m sure there was still talk of 92 then. No sympathy for them at all, they’ve actively made the country worse and deserve what they are gonna get.

What does Labour need to do in their first term to be a success though? Would be interested in pre-manifesto thoughts

What does Labour have to do? IMO:

- Reduce net migration
- Carry inflation reduction to <2% and keep it there 
- Improve NHS approval + reduce waiting lists 
- Increase house building numbers
- XX,000 new police officers
- Continue to support Ukraine (hopefully to the point Russia backs down)

They’re the broad strokes I reckon, steady and measurable improvement that they can take back to the electorate.

Realistically all apart from the first one is achievable none of the major parties will admit it but Immigration is keeping this country afloat.

Migration (both legal and illegal) should be lower.

We should build more homes.

The government has the power to influence both of these things. It has utterly failed to do so.

One of these is far easier to achieve than the other.

Building houses is not as difficult as you think. This country used to build 400k houses a year in the 30s and 60s. As a society we have chosen not to build enough houses since the 80s.

What’s harder, building an entire house from scratch or saying the word “no” to an immigration applicant?

I’m going to need to have a long hard think about this one.

There's no reason they can't have more sensible immigration controls AND build more houses - why fixate on immigration only, is there an underlying motive there?

Fixing immigration is a far quicker and effective way of solving housing shortages. It also costs society far less, financially and culturally. 

It’s tiring seeing the same ‘just build more houses’ argument. It’s puerile and deliberately skirts the obvious because it’s not politically palatable.

They made the U.K. look incompetent as they burn down every bridge with the EU and other allies,"Anyone else sick of the constant Labour-bashing?

There have been a fair few comments blaming Labour for everything here recently and I just don't get it. 

I'd be on the centre-left and pro-Remain but I do respect democracy. People voted leave and the UK left the EU. They voted for Johnson and now they have him. 

What I don't get is that this is all somehow Labour's fault. Labour did not devastate whole communities across this country with needless austerity, Labour did not slash taxes for the wealthiest and impose the costs on those least able to bear them and Labour did not call a needless referendum on the EU simply to keep itself together. 

In 2019, I held my nose and voted for the Corbyn loyalist on my ballot. It's now infuriating that plenty of those to the left of me would rather stay home and give the Tories a home run. 

I see nonsense about how Emily Thornberry tweeting something about a van and a St. George's Cross is somehow a great reason to vote the Tories in again. Just because people say that they're not allowed to say certain things doesn't make it true and I'm fed up of these lazy excuses that people give for voting Tory and then whinging endlessly about it. I know one person who voted for them in 2015 because she didn't think Labour would win. I've heard people say they vote Tory because Labour don't do anything. I've relatives who just vote blue without thinking about it. 

People can vote for whoever and whatever they want but pretending like they're ciphers or otherwise sheep who'll just do as they're told is more than a bit insulting. I come from a working class background and the idea that I've to vote Tory because of some vague apocryphal nonsense about champagne socialists and working class people being seen as mouth breathing racists is just a lazy excuse not to engage in serious discussion. 

Whatever you think about Starmer, he isn't responsible for Brexit (if you're pro-remain) or the disastrous handling of the pandemic. Let's bear that in mind.

I was just curious about the reason for dropping the word 'Fresh'.,"What ever happened to 'Fresh Cream' cakes?

It was my favourite treat as a kid (over 20 years ago) and was sold in all the supermarkets and local bakers. The products usually came on little cases with a blue cow logo saying 'Fresh Cream' or 'Real Dairy Cream'. 

It was a good way to differentiate from the similar but cheaper alternatives which used butter cream style creams.

Like cream slices:

or cream ice fingers
https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/iced_fingers_34133/

You can clearly still buy these types of cakes but they never use the phrase 'Fresh Cream' anymore. Was it the result of an EU regulation back in the day?

Lol what a weird post. I don't see why the word fresh needs to be stated. Just because they use cream by itself doesn't mean it is buttercream style.

Anyway you're wrong and to prove it, Morrisons have a large selection, which I saw with my own eyes yesterday.

Fresh Cream Chocolate Sponge

Fresh Cream Victoria Sponge

Fresh Cream and Lemon Muffins

Fresh Cream and Jam Muffins

Fresh Cream Raspberry Turnovers

Fresh Cream Éclairs

And more

No conspiracy cooked up by Big Cream.

That's interesting. The cakes you list are produced by the inhouse bakery though and come in plain packaging with a label from a printer and the wording controlled by the bakery. I've not noticed in any other supermarket.

What I'm particularly referring to are products which come in full colour printed boxes like

eclairs
https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-chocolate-eclairs/426024-724955-724956

These products always used to have the phrase 'Fresh Cream', but now always just say 'Cream'. I have not seen the word 'Fresh' used on any of this style of packaging in any supermarket for years. There must be a reason for that? Some EU directive perhaps

I've also seen the term 'British Cream' used a lot in place of 'Fresh Cream'
https://www.coop.co.uk/products/co-op-british-cream-strawberry-trifle-600g

I mean sure ok. I don't know why it's a big deal though? Why does it matter if it says fresh or not?

The Unanimity rule exists because no country wants to be in a position where they are forced to accept major laws against their will. It allows EU members to remain as mostly sovereign states as each country can veto any major laws it doesn’t want to implement.

While it would make things bureaucratically easier, scrapping the unanimity rule will massively fuel the eurosceptics who will be able to legitimately claim that the EU is forcing countries to accept laws they do not want, and that EU countries are no longer sovereign states.

As we get closer and closer to the next GE, and it looks crystal clear that the Tories are on the way out, is anyone else just absolutely scunnered with the options on the table?

You've got an SNP in absolute free-fall who are no closer than they were in 2014 to achieving their goal of independence whilst also still not being able to answer the difficult questions like how exactly would independence make the average Scot better off?

You've got the Tories, their 14 years of austerity which has made us all poorer and their daft Brexit experiment, culminating in a UK that is in terminal decline.

Then you've got a Labour Party that seem to be showing a complete lack of ambition for the country. It seems like every single week Keir Starmer is rolling back pledges... to the point where I don't even know what Labour stands for anymore.

So it seems our options are either aggressive decline under the Tories, or begrudgingly accepting mild, managed decline under Labour. It's gotten to the point where I don't even know if I'll bother voting this year. Labour's entire identity is based around 'not being my opponent' which just highlights the complete lack of ambition I've already mentioned. It's negative politics. It might do you well in the short-term, but in the long term people are going to want to see tangible changes to things like their standard of living. Currently, I am not seeing anything from the Labour Party that suggests much will change. At best, things might end up being 5% less shit than they are right now.

Yes, Labour are obviously preferable to the Tories. If the opinion polls were a lot narrower I'd probably hold my nose and vote Labour because the alternative is so much worse. However, they've been commanding 15-20 point leads for nearly two years now, and given that a Labour majority is pretty much a shoe-in, I'd rather not stick my name to mediocrity.

Anyone else feeling the same?

EDIT: Fucks wrong with the folk saying ""Vote Reform UK""? I'd much rather stick my finger up my arse and lick it than vote for a bunch of Faragists.

After a decade of EU membership, the Balkan nation has joined the Euro and Schengen zones. As the EU Single Market celebrates its 30th anniversary this year, this signifies a dramatic shift in how Croatian residents and enterprises participate with and use its benefits.

Can someone smarter than me explain how the end of the checks between NI and Britain can fit with 1) the Withdrawal Agreement 2) the Windsor Framework, and not piss off the EU?

In theory, the document appears to suggest that Westminster now has a new onus itself to ensure there is no potential conflict in standards between GB and NI when passing and scrutinising trade legislation, which would minimise divergence between the UK and the EU.

Well no conflict in standards = UK adopts EU standards by the backdoor... Just without single market access in return.

Remember when no trace of racism could be tolerated in the Labour party?

Look the left can go on screaming about how *having an immigration system* is just racism even though every country on earth including the countries where most of the immigrants to this country come from has one, but in the real world, society wants and needs to be able to manage the flow of people into its labour market to act in the best interests of the citizen population, so will ignore the left if it keeps playing up like this.

Hi, I am from Quebec and recently the debate about the survival of our language in north america has been coming again and again.

Among the 50 states of USA, the 10 provinces and three territories of Canada we are the only province with the official french language (except New brunswick which has two language).

Now while Canada has 2 official language, the truth is that most french speaking people becomes billingual and the english speaking part are much less interested in learning french. Our language is threatened and it's been discussed politically how to improve the situation.

Now of course our situation does have a few aspects that help us,

\- French is spoken around the world and therefore many immigrants like the one from haiti, Morroco, Senegal, etc. Already speak french and therefore is easier help us in preserving french.

\- We also have french dubbing for both video games, tv series and movies. When they are not dubbed in French canadian, we at least have access to the European french dub.

I am not there to mock you by the way to tell you why your situation might be worse, just explaining what is our situation in general. And I wondered :

**1. Do you have dubbing that is made in the welsh language for series, movies, video games?**

**2. Is there a lot of movies or content that are made for a welsh audience and made with mostly welsh dialogues?**

**3. What is happening with the independance movment of Wales? Last time I checked it was 48% who were in favor of leaving the UK**

**4. What is happening with your young ones, are they proud of speaking and learning welsh, the language of the lands of wales or they do consider that english is the ""cool"" language?**

Our youth is becoming more americanized due to the domination of their movie, series and game industry. We still make movies by Québécois for Québécois but they are watched by a niche audience.

&#x200B;

To be honest with you, Last year I watched the *The Crown*, my favorite episodes was the one where prince Charles tries to learn welsh to make a speech. It made me curious about the lands of wales and his indepence movement.

I yearns for the day that Quebec could be an independant republic and you guys are a source of inspiration for us.

So I wondered about you and your language.

So the Tories have been in power for thirteen years, during which they have had four prime ministerial resignations (due to scandal or policy failure), and yet LOTO *still* doesn't have a net positive approval rating.  He can't lose but he won't last more than one term.

It's *very* rare for politicians to have positive approval ratings. -11 is actually pretty good.

Why the bloody hell wouldn’t it cause outrage?,"Why is the idea of National Service generating so much outrage online?

I’m not sure how the nationwide consensus looks like, but it’s weird to see so many people online getting mad about this.

Firstly, this isn’t 1914/World War I conscription. Nobody will be forced to undertake military training if they don’t want to. Nobody will be forced to put boots on the ground if they don’t want to. 

Secondly, many European countries have implemented or are implementing similar schemes. And for good reason - we have a Russia that is trying to wipe Ukrainians out of existence and verbally threatens NATO and EU countries all the time. 

Thirdly, if you believe in a particular set of values, I believe that you must be prepared to defend them. If we refuse to do that, then what do we have left? Emigration? To where?

The only argument against this that I see as valid is that the Tories are untrustworthy hypocrites for trying to introduce this. But I also see a lot of people attacking the spirit of the plan, and that in particular doesn’t make any sense to me.

It’s literally slavery. Why the bloody hell wouldn’t it cause outrage?"
