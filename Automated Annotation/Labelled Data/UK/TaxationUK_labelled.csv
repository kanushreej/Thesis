**Monday 12 March**

**Financial Guidance and Claims Bill - report stage and 3rd reading**
Creates a single body to help members of the public manage their finances, consolidating services that are currently provided by the Money Advice Service, the Pensions Advisory Service and the Department for Work and Pensions. Also gives the Financial Conduct Authority the power to regulate claims companies (like the ones that help people win compensation for personal injury), and transfers the responsibility for investigating complaints against these companies to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Started in the Lords, so if it passes these stages, it just needs the Lords to approve any amendments before it can become law.

**Tuesday 13 March**

**Spring financial statement**
This isn't a bill, but we've included it here because this is when Chancellor Philip Hammond delivers the government's latest economic forecasts. The Treasury doesn't want the event to be seen as a ""mini Budget"" (which happens in the autumn), so there'll be no red box, official document, spending increases or tax changes.

**Wednesday 14 March**

No votes scheduled.

**Thursday 15 March**

No votes scheduled.

**Friday 16 March**

**Unpaid Trial Work Periods (Prohibition) Bill - 2nd reading**
Bans unpaid trial shifts for workers unless they're given feedback on their performance and told how long the trial period will last, what qualities they need to demonstrate, how many jobs are available and how they'll find out if they're successful or not.

**BBC Licence Fee (Civil Penalty) Bill - 2nd reading**
Decriminalises the non-payment of the BBC licence fee.

**International Development Assistance (Definition) Bill - 2nd reading**
Changes the definition of international development assistance. Details beyond that are scant because a draft hasn't been published.

**Benefits and Public Services (Restriction) Bill - 2nd reading**
Restricts non-UK citizens' access to benefits and other public services.

**Electronic Cigarettes (Regulation) Bill - 2nd reading**
Regulates the use and sale of e-cigarettes. Also exempts them from any UK laws made as a result of the EU's Tobacco Products Directive, such as size limits on e-cigarette tanks and refill containers, requirements that they be child proof, and obligatory health warnings on packages.

**Criminal Fraud (Private Prosecutions) Bill - 2nd reading**
Relates to private prosecutions (when a private individual or organisation takes someone to court on a criminal charge) in cases of suspected criminal fraud. Details beyond that are scant because a draft hasn't been published.

**Affordable Home Ownership Bill - 2nd reading**
Requires the inclusion of rent to buy homes in the definition of affordable housing, ensures a minimum proportion of new affordable housing is available on affordable rent to buy terms, and abolishes stamp duty for rent to buy homes.

**Hospital Car Parking Charges (Abolition) Bill - 2nd reading**
Abolishes car parking charges at NHS hospitals for patients, staff and visitors.

**Universal Credit (Application, Advice and Assistance) Bill - 2nd reading**
A wide-ranging bill reforming the universal credit system (benefits for those who are on low incomes or out of work). Among other things, it requires the government to pay claimants within a month of a valid application being been made (subject to some exceptions), outlines minimum payment options that must be explained clearly to claimants, and allows terminally ill claimants to continue receiving payments without having to work.

**Courts (Abuse of Process) Bill - 2nd reading**
Allows family and civil courts to throw out applications where they deem that a perpetrator of domestic abuse, stalking or harassment is using the claim to try to contact their victims.

**Pedicabs (London) Bill - 2nd reading**
Allows Transport for London to regulate pedicabs (bikes with a trailer attached for carrying passengers). Includes a wide range of possible regulations, including licensing, fares, safety, working conditions and speed restrictions.

**Domestic Properties (Minimum Energy Performance) Bill - 2nd reading**
Requires the government to ensure that all domestic properties have a minimum Energy Performance Certificate rating of C (with exceptions). The deadline is 2030 for homes occupied by people in fuel poverty and 2035 for all other properties.

**Vagrancy (Repeal) Bill - 2nd reading**
Scraps the Vagrancy Act, a law from 1824 that makes it illegal to sleep rough or beg.

**Clean Air Bill - 2nd reading**
Requires the government to set and enforce air quality targets, and reduce air pollution using clean air zones (among other methods). Also introduces new laws about vehicle emission testing and restricts the sale of vehicles with certain engine types.

**Registration of Marriage (No. 2) Bill - 2nd reading**
Introduces an electronic system for marriage registrations and allows details of the spouses' mothers to be included. Note: the bill itself doesn't make these changes. Instead, it allows the government to do it by introducing new regulations.

**Voter Registration (No. 2) Bill - 2nd reading**
Bans people from being registered to vote in parliamentary elections at more than one address.

**Kew Gardens (Leases) (No.2) Bill - 2nd reading**
Extends the length of time Kew Gardens is allowed to lease land for to 150 years, from 31 years currently. This could include residential or commercial use. The aim is to help Kew increase its self-generated income.

**Rivers Authorities and Land Drainage Bill - 2nd reading**
Among other things, allows the government to establish local rivers authorities, which would deal with flood risk management. The bill is aimed at turning the Somerset Rivers Authority (which was formed in response to the floods of 2013 and 2014) into a statutory body.

LabourUK,post,tax rate,nq3a71,MMSTINGRAY,John Rees: The Class Struggle Under New Labour (July 1997),"I'd expect more of this from Blair as he continues to court Blarities

>Let’s take one small example of this process. In late May Tony Blair attacked the salary rises of the directors of the lottery operator Camelot. They were hauled before Chris Smith, the national heritage minister, to explain their conduct. At one level a properly cynical response to this development is quite right: it is cheap progressive publicity for Labour and, in any case, Blair is close to Richard Branson who wants to take over the lottery and run it as a non profit making operation (although the ‘consumer friendly’ publicity will generate lots of profitable business for the Virgin empire). Certainly it is right to say that no anti-capitalist intent is visible here. Anyone who claimed that there were such intentions would be painting Blair in colours far more favourable than he deserves.

>But that is far from being the only important argument about this issue. It is at least equally important to note that if a Labour prime minister attacks the salaries of the directors of one nationally prominent corporation it cannot help but give encouragement to every shop steward and union activist to make the same point about the managers and directors of their company. What seems like the promotion of illusions can turn into the inspiration for resistance. As the old adage has it, life looks very different depending on whether you view it from the cottage or the castle.

>Of course, it is only the fact that working class consciousness had already moved to the left before the election, and that this move was bolstered by the election result, that allows this interpretation of events. If there were no such consciousness among workers then Blair’s manoeuvres would never have effects contrary to his intentions. But as such a consciousness does exist much of a socialist strategy depends on recognising the contradictory impulses of Labour’s statements and exploiting them to the advantage of rank and file workers. Concretely, in this case, it would be a mistake if every resolution over pay and conditions in every union in the country did not make use of Blair’s attack on the directors of Camelot to sanction action against directors in other firms who have enjoyed similar rises over recent years.

>This kind of approach is all the more important because Blair quite deliberately follows an approach which combines either small reforms, the appearance of reform or the rhetoric of reform with policy which is wholly reactionary. Thus Blair talks of a ‘People’s Europe’ in which ‘there is less obsession with ourselves and our institutions, more focus on the things that matter to people’ but, in reality, he refuses to support the social chapter in the new European treaty unless if encourages ‘flexible labour markets’ (ie low pay and job insecurity). Yet these are the very things that most trade unionists think the social chapter will alleviate. Similarly, Blair’s priority of ‘education, education, education’ is already being used by teachers and parents campaigning against Labour’s plans to close schools, ‘fast track’ the sacking of teachers, and send in ‘hit squads’ headed by the very man, Chris Woodhead, who became hated as the head of Ofsted under the Tories. Or again, the government’s decision to lift the ban on unions at GCHQ can give confidence to every activist trying to organise a non-unionised workplace, despite the fact that Labour is committed to keeping the Tory anti-union laws which make the task so difficult.

>These contradictions are going to repeat themselves across the entire front of government policy. Blair and his advisers are keen to emulate Bill Clinton’s ‘tough love’ approach, described by The Guardian’s Larry Elliot as an ‘anomalous mixture of liberalism and authoritarianism. The Prime Minister will be Tony, just as Bill Gates of Microsoft is Bill, but the jeans and open necked shirt approach has to co-exist with ruthlessness ...’ [4] Peter Mandelson seeks to exploit this contradiction to Labour’s advantage, almost matching each reactionary policy with an announcement of some cosmetic or superficial measure which appeals to the progressive sentiments nurtured by Labour’s victory. The vestiges of political control may be removed from the Bank of England but, don’t worry, Labour will run an ‘ethical foreign policy’. Single parents will be targeted for ‘welfare to work’ interviews but at the same time Clare Short plans to ‘end world poverty’ by freeing overseas aid from being tied to business deals. Refusal to tax the rich is coupled with the windfall tax on the profits of the utilities.

>This public relations operation is already seen for what it is by a very substantial proportion of Labour activists. For some, doubts about Blair have not been alleviated by the scale of the election victory. And as time passes it will be the hard core of pro-capitalist policy which emerges as by far the dominant, and obviously dominant, part of the New Labour equation. The full force of circumstances pushing Labour in this direction will become clear when we examine the economic prospects facing Labour (see below). Here it is only necessary to note that Blair is ideologically committed to allowing the ‘full rigour of the market’ to do its work.

>It was this commitment to the market which stood behind Blair and Brown’s decision to make the Bank of England independent, as Larry Elliot explains:

>This change … underpins Labour’s technocratic approach to running the country. Once you have dispensed with the idea that conflict is natural – even healthy – and that there are [any] real class or sectional interests, the answer to every problem is to call in the experts. It makes perfect sense to hand over the interest rates to the Bank of England and to call in the head of BP as minister for export promotion. They are, after all, likely to make a better fist of things than elected politicians. [5]

>Since this was written Martin Taylor, chief executive of Barclays Bank, has been appointed to head a Whitehall team on tax and benefits, and Lord Hollick, chairman of United News and Media, has been called in to advise on industrial policy. Indeed Blair has been forced to admit that he has made more political appointments in Whitehall than the Tories did. He also looks set to have more unelected ministers in the Lords than the Tories, making a mockery of the election pledge to reform the upper house. In this world ‘independent’, ‘expert’ and ‘neutral’ are simply euphemisms for free market economics.

>Blair and Brown and the massed ranks of their advisers will stick to this element of their project long after the elements of superficial radicalism have been swept away. It is an article of faith among the Blairites that ‘corporatism’ was to blame for keeping Labour out of power for 18 years and, more broadly, that ‘planning’ was the root of all evil in the Stalinist states. They are consequently much more ideologically committed to market solutions than the previous generation of Labour right wingers.

>This pro-market stance puts them on a trajectory diametrically opposed to both the interests and the consciousness of the vast majority of people who voted Labour. Yet it would be a mistake to assume that, even when this contradiction becomes sharper than it is today, such a conflict will result in the Blairites giving way or changing course. One only has to recall the ruling classes’ free market policy, in particular the defence of the gold standard, followed by Labour’s Ramsay MacDonald and Philip Snowden in Britain in the inter-war years, to see that no amount of evidence of failure, or working class discontent, or even the wrecking of their own party, is necessarily enough to make Labour’s leaders shed their belief in the market.

>Moreover, these pro-market attitudes are much more than an economic orthodoxy. Every aspect of Blair’s social policy is riddled with the same assumptions. If there is unemployment it can’t be the fault of the market, it must be a result of welfare (described by new minister Frank Field as ‘the enemy within’). If there is ‘choice’ in the supermarket, why not ‘parental choice’ in education? And if ‘choice’ isn’t working it must be the fault of lazy teachers and failing schools. If young people are breaking the law the answer can’t be a job or a decent wage, it must be ‘fast track sentencing’.

>Even a commentator as sympathetic to the Blarite project as The Observer editor Will Hutton finds Labour’s orthodoxy unsettling:

>The Conservative vote may have fallen to the lowest since 1832, but the lesson drawn by some at the top of the Labour Party is not – in social policy at least – that neo-conservative approaches to welfare and work should be qualified. Paradoxically, they should be intensified.

>For these Labour zealots, Hutton argues:

>… systems of social insurance become obstacles to work because those who use them become scroungers and welfare cheats...welfare must become conditional upon effort, and offer no more than a safety net between jobs; if inequality results, it must – like death and taxes – be seen as an unavoidable fact of life about which the community can do nothing. [6]

>In both social policy and economic strategy the contradictions between the needs and desires of working people and the direction upon which the new government is set can only grow sharper. But even today, in its current unstable form, these contradictions open up opportunities for socialists, if they know how to take them. This requires that where Blair is at his most reactionary – in his Downing Street meeting with Thatcher, in sending the hit squads into schools, in freezing public sector pay – the left should unequivocally condemn the government and explain how its policies are linked to its acceptance of the very same capitalist priorities that the Tories were thrown out of office for defending. But this criticism will be all the more effective if we take some of Labour’s pronouncements as the basis for arguing against the government. Is spending £13 billion on the Trident missile system and another £3 billion on a new class of nuclear submarine, for instance, an ‘ethical foreign policy’? Is it an ‘ethical’ domestic policy when we are told there is no more money for hospitals and schools? If it is wrong for Camelot directors to increase their own six figure salaries by 30 percent, is it not also wrong to put an academic who ‘earns’ a six figure salary in charge of the commission which will decide the level of the minimum wage? Even before the election, an editorial in The Independent pinpointed exactly the kind of paradox Blairism creates:

>... New Labour’s bid to have capitalism and all its works without its ‘cultural contradictions’...strives to produce rules for social life when economic life is less rule-bounded than ever. The question is whether government can impose these rules ...

>Mr Blair would like parents to spend more time with their children. Quite right. Does that mean that he is in favour of maximum 48 hour weeks, or new laws to force employers to recognise the domestic circumstances of their staff? [7]

>Such arguments can gain a substantial audience now. The probable economic prospects mean that the size of that audience is likely to increase the longer the Labour government lasts.

A central question will be about your housing because prices vary dramatically across the UK. Your best option is probably to buy one and I imagine that would mean selling the one you have. So the value of your current home is important. Or whatever you rent it out for if you decided to keep it and rent here. 

It's easy to go online and look at houses for sale in the UK to get an idea. 

Another Redditor said that many people in the UK retire to the south coast. This is true but property there is expensive - Brighton is nearly up to London prices. 

Living rurally in the UK normally requires running a car. But I'd say you can do that on your budget.

There are various areas in Scotland that could work for you. More remote areas are lovely but living there can work out more expensive. Scotland has a lot of relatively affordable houses - away from the main cities. And buying a house in Scotland is very straightforward. In England it's complicated and messy. 

The cost of houses in Aberdeenshire went down by quite a lot because of the slowdown in the oil and gas sector. But it can be a great area to live in.

ukpolitics,post,tax rate,ffh5g2,callingacab,We're learning the wrong lessons from New Labour,"Many commentators here and elsewhere are adamant that Labour can only win the next election by returning to a more moderate program, or to what some describe as the “political centre”. This planar way of viewing politics is neither constructive nor accurate in any way - it severely lacks any nuance. Need I remind you how some of the Lib Dems' best electoral performances were during the New Labour years? Logic dictates that a centrist Labour Party should have cannibalised them.

Some clever people are frothing at the bit to bring up Labour's Militant years with Foot as a parallel to how a ""leftist cult"" condemned Labour to losing all those years ago. However, let's not forget the fact that his successor, aka the moderate Kinnock, also lost 2 successive elections, one of which was to John Major (the Theresa May of a past time). 

So what did Blair do that Kinnock didn't?

New Labour was an exercise in branding, first and foremost. It really was an overhaul of the party's image - at the turn of the millennium they were able to reinvent themselves as modern, metropolitan, cool etc - thus capturing the mood of a generation. Not only that, but they knew how to play the game - Campbell and Mandelson were ruthless when it came to spin in the media and were able to rival the Tories' network. Their policies were straightforward and focused to key policy areas with simple soundbites that resonated with the general public. We also can't forget how Blair sold his soul to the devil - by courting the baron Rupert Murdoch, who demanded from Blair that Britain would never rejoin the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in exchange for his support. But that's getting away from the point.

These tactics are not exclusive to the moderate wing of the party, though I do believe that those closer to the left may be inclined to look down on spin and salesmen tactics as the kind of slick politicking that they rail against. But I believe that this is where the party must compromise - not necessarily on matters of policy (though there is room for discussion) but on presentation. Jeremy Corbyn was a bleeding heart who couldn't understand how others didn't see the world the same way as him (full disclosure: I am the same). He thought tales of austerity and homelessness would be enough to win the hearts of swing voters, as he had done with the Labour membership. In an ideal world this would be the case, but this was not enough when we were already fighting an uphill battle. 

Some are convinced that pushing the Overton Window can only happen by starting in the centre and pushing leftwards from government. Blair it seems made no effort to accomplish this. And therein lies one of the main issues with New Labour - rather than trying to redefine the political landscape, it simply fought elections on Thatcher's terms. We all know how she described New Labour as her ""greatest achievement"". Blair had an opportunity to create a new political consensus based on community, social justice, putting people before profits etc. Instead, he consolidated the grip of Thatcherism on our system – individualism and corporate greed.  By endorsing Blair all the way into 10 Downing Street, the right-wing press played an absolute blinder - by legitimising a neoliberal Labour Party as the only true ""viable"" opposition, they would ensure that Labour could never appoint someone who would actually fight their hegemonic business interest in the world of media. 

The moderates in the party seem to fundamentally misunderstand how Blair actually came to power, as evidenced by their constant undermining of Corbyn's leadership [every single day](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/21/peter-mandelson-i-try-to-undermine-jeremy-corbyn-every-day). Rather than rallying behind a popular leader they decided to backstab him (or front stab if you're Jess Phillips) by resigning from his unity cabinets, challenging him in leadership elections etc. Through hubris, they fulfilled their own prophecy of Corbyn's unelectability. And they were unable to provide an alternative vision for Labour, presumably since many of them had no guiding principles or beliefs - they only sought to relive the glorious noughties whilst simultaneously criticising Corbyn for being stuck in the past himself, albeit in the 1980s. Those years saw some of Labour's worst performances - especially in 1983. The moderates back then wholly abandoned Foot's Labour to form the SDP, who joined up with the Liberals and doubled their vote share. Who knows what might have happened if the moderates stayed as a united front on the left? It seems like this is a common occurrence amongst the centrists in the Labour Party - they are unable to cope with not being in charge and ending up wrecking the party's chances. Yet the Left never abandoned the Labour Party en masse, not even after New Labour and Iraq. What I found abhorrent this past week was those critics on the right of the party saying that Momentum and the left had “failed those who needed a Labour government” implying that we had blood on our hands as a result of our “ideological purity testing”. Yet the moderates were all too ready to throw those same people under the bus with their austerity manifestoes in 2010 and 2015. And how can they blame the loss on the Left when it was those same moderates who were pushing for the second referendum that lost us key seats? 

I hope this gives you all an insight into why those of us on the left are hesitant at the calls for moderation.

tories,comment,income tax,ftaoeij,Blakajac,," **Climate Change.**

> Do you feel the conservative party is doing enough to prepare or mitigate and lead? What policy would you advocate?

No, but some of the work being done is good. 

The energy markets have been nudged in the right direction and we are less rellianton fossil fuels for electricity than before, gas will be harder to replace though. This will likely require investment in better energy storage infrastructure, and there doesn't seem to be the willpower or incentive for this currently, one policy area that I would work on.

The flip side is that we are still not doing very well with transport and in the home energy use, driving cars and burning gas to heat leaky homes. To combat this I think we need to pull a classic Tory move and nick a few opponent policies on housing improvement and public transport (particularly rural bus support), both of these would also help those on lower incomes quality of life and opportunity. The combustion engine ban is a good step, but we need to get electric charging infrastructure  rolled out more quickly, particularly for homes and workplaces.

>An economy that grows 3% every year doubles in size in 25 years, do you think we can continue to expect to grow the economy in light of climate change? If so, how?

The UK has quite a service based industry, and digital/tech industries are growing. It will be hard to get everyone to pivot from fast fashion and throwaway consumerism but societal changes are happening. The energy market changes I mentioned should help the digital sector grow without parallel emissions. I don't think we can be 100% sustainable with growth as we need to vastly improve the reuse/reclaim/recycle structure of the economy, but we could be worse placed too.

**Wealth Inequality and Billionaires / Multinational Corporations.**

>How do you feel about the existence of billionaires and their contribution to the economy / the public purse, and from a moral point of view?

I'm not too fussed about inequality, the more important metric for me is eliminating poverty. High earners/spenders contribute lots in taxes (and some of them through philanthropy), and many fortunes will have been earned through hard work and risk. One thing that does concern me though is the power of ridiculously large/powerful companies, although the CMA does a fairly good job with traditional businesses e.g. ASDA/Sainsbury's, the tech companies are a different kettle of fish.

>What if anything, would you like to see the conservative party do regarding the ultrawealthy & multinational corporate tax avoidance?

Not sure on specific policy but it is a continuous cat and mouse situation to close the loopholes which will never end. Tax avoidance is fair game, tax evasion is not, international collaboration will be important to combat some elements.

**Automation.**

>How would you like to see society adjust to an economy that can support significantly fewer jobs?

Another difficult one, automation will also create new jobs in certain industries, so upskilling will be important, this is probably a weak point at the moment of the labour force, I think the Lib Dems had a policy of a skills budget or something. What we will need to do depends upon the rate and nature of changes, many jobs will still require the human element. If there is growth prospects/opportunity, businesses will identify what they need and that will guide the market.

I have considered the merits of UBI/negative tax, I think this could be a good way to A) reduce the inordinate bureaucracy of the welfare system and B) support a transitioning economy, but I don't think it would ever be a total substitute for work, and probably actually is more to do with welfare reform than automation, but that depends on the speed of change again.",2020-06-07T19:33:40+00:00,t3_gybrjg,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

england,comment,tax,c8f0ram,Raeli,,"There is, from my understanding, a lot of, what can only be described as Propaganda about how horrible our Health systems are over here, and how they're all commies and must die! Or something...

But seriously, what little I have seen of Americans commenting on it, it seems to be that their media takes any chance to point out when there is an issue with the NHS. It's not a perfect system by any means, and there's always some way you can take some data of some sort and construed it to be that the system is horrible.

It's an extremely self centered world in America. Everything is always about the individual rather than society at large. Their mental health system is dog shit, why? Because no one wants to pay for anyone else, they don't seem to realise though that having a system paid for by taxes isn't going to be a whole lot different than just paying health insurance for a large chunk of people, but for a lot, it will be a whole lot better.

The difference is, in England, you pay your taxes, and if anything at all happens, you have medical coverage. In America, there's a whole laundry list of things that the Insurance companies will do to get out of paying, even things that aren't related - like, you break your leg in a car crash, but you failed to mention that you got a sprained wrist when you were 5, so your insurance is invalid, and you have to fork out thousands of dollars anyway.

Not only this, but on top of insurance, you have the crazy absurd prices of medication, which, from my understanding isn't covered by insurance either (I could be mistaken).

We have such little control over google and our daily workplace/employers - and what the EU demands in exchange for its benefits and membership of the club seem paltry by comparison! "" - Fair enough.  We'll just have to disagree here.  If the goal is for greater integration (which has been stated as being the goal quite clearly before the migrant crisis) then legal supremacy creep is how they will achieve it.  Essentially I view the supremacy argument as a gateway to greater integration, and if I dislike the EU now, then greater integration is the last thing id want.  Hence this becomes forefront.

While I may not like the existing government (I dont) and there is a good discussion to be had as to whether it needs reform.  There is no way that I would pick another government structure which I also think needs reform, and add it on top of the existing behemoth we already have.  The chance of any actual reform taking place reduces the further away you step from the system.  So I do not see the additional system of the EU as a solution.

Edit: I do think you're right about immigration simply being filled by alternate means.  Hopefully in the mean time they'll sort out the mess to vocational qualifications in the country so we can reduce reliance on foreign labour (im not holding my breath though)

His cabinet are the same.

His back tracking on rent controls and reinstating DfID has been the nail in the coffin.

As it stands I'll be voting Lib Dem. I'm in a safe Labour seat so it'll be more of a protest vote than one likely to bring change, but I can't bring myself to vote Labour again.

Lib Dem policies include:
- Rejoining the single market.
- Electoral reform (PR).
- Raising taxes on energy companies and passing it onto consumers.
- Energy support for small businesses.
- Tax water companies to pay for sewage clean up.
- Repealing Tory anti-protest laws.
