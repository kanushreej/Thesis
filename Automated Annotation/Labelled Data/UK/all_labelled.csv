If Sunak and the Tories had a Brexit sized wedge issue they could exploit then I firmly believe they would be able to kick the can down the road, not vet any paper candidates and just deal with it later - its what Johnson would have done (and pretty much did, afterall).

But this time there is no wedge issue big enough. The war on woke broadly only captures votes from existing headbangers. The Rwanda flights and small boats, especially the latter, had potential to shore up the blue wall but it feels like the sort of issue that means a lot more in very local areas (e.g., the south coast). No energy crisis to speak of, no COVID to speak of (in the sense of an exploitable crisis). Defense would have been ripe for exploitation if Sunak had chosen it instead of the war on woke, but it now just appears as an afterthought, not to mention that there isn't much daylight between their and Labour's policies on defense spending anyway.

My point: Paper candidates with no vetting and little campaigning can (and have) done exceptionally well recently when a huge wedge issue is driving the electorate. But Sunak's campaign is (currently) 'Labour have no plan', which I don't think is in any way enough to drive any more than the 'always vote blue' mob to flock to these candidates.

If you look at Western Romania you'll see it was a huge multicaultural place with Romanians, Germans, Serbs, Hungarians, and Jews all cohabitating in pretty equal proportions. It is true that nowadays we get immigrants from countries from which most people 100 years ago couldn't even locate to which continent they belonged to, and who are culturally very different from us. However, I'm not making an argument about immigration here. I am not even pro-immigration or  pro-refugees, or whatever. I categorically think we shouldn't be letting everyone in en-masse no matter how incompatible they are with the local culture. What I am is pro-Democracy, and that means admitting that citizens of a country have certain inalienable rights. 

My notion of citizenship isn't vague at all. There are very clear rules to becoming a citizen of a country. Not everyone can can just become one. Most people apply for a visa to get the right to live there temporarily based on some point system. There's criteria you have to meet to become a citizen; tests, time lived.in the country, interviews, ect. They hold a a whole ceremony around it if you manage to acheive the requirements. Finally, you even get a document that explicitly states your a citizen of X country. There is literally nothing vague about that. Then you join the democratic society of the country which means you have the right to vote and essentially engage in the rulership of that country, usually indirectly through representatives, or sometimes more directly through referendums/swiss democracy/ect. That's just how it works in a democracy. Everyone has an equal share of control of the state (ultimately). Nobody can just come in and arbitrarily decide that everyone with a Hemoglobin concentration over 15 has to give up their rights tomorrow and go work in the mines against their will. This isn't the 1500s. 

It's certainly less vague than pre-WW1 and the rise of nationalism where citizenship wasn't even a real concept. Before that people just moved somewhere and lived their lives more or less integrating into the local culture, or if groups of people moved together, they'd often form enclaves of their own culture which either caused problems or their culture would eventually go on to melt together with dominant local one. There weren't any passports, and there wasn't any democracy. You were mostly ruled by some King, whose right to rule was allegedly given to him directly by God himself, who also had the right to expel you whenever the hell he wanted. That's the kind of crazy shit that existed outside of the modern nations state. 

Now, if you're trying to point out that the ease of obtaining citizenship is too lax, well maybe you'd be right, I don't necessarily disagree, but if you think citizens in a country should be grouped and segrated, I think that's wrong and incompatible with the very core of how our modern countries work.",2019-11-15T15:38:46+00:00,t1_f7kqmax,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

They don’t (in my opinion) “fail” to fly to the corresponding building over the other side of the Thames. In order for the projected attempt to fail, there must have been at least a minute scintilla of potential success.

It doesn’t matter if the person standing on the edge of the roof (ready to flap their tiny wings using a pulley system of lengths of thread), tells you that they “know” it’s going to be all right (in fact, it’s “going to be fantastic”). It’s of no importance that he is surrounded by dodgy-looking characters, all egging him on. And there’s no difference caused by the insults and accusations thrown at the other people up on that roof who are desperately trying to stop this catastrophe. There is not, never was, nor ever could be the slightest *atom* of a chance that it’s going to go any other way.

Yes, Islamic democracies exist, but I wouldn’t want to live in one, nor is it a life I’d wish for my children. More to the point, whilst some immigration has had a brilliant impact on the country and continent, other immigration hasn’t, it’s brought lots of social problems that we could have done without, which I grew up with in London, and which I’ve seen develop first hand in a shockingly short space of time in Sweden and Germany. Islam is only a small part of the problem. It’s got much more to do with ethnicity and culture, and the interplay of immigrant societies with host societies. With different immigrant groups having vastly different impacts which are all too often lumped together.

I’m so exhausted of having seen the same sequence of arguments play out: it isn’t happening, you’re mad, followed by it might be happening, but you haven’t understood the impact, to it is happening, but it’s a good thing, followed by it is happening, it’s shit, but you/we deserve it. The Left has been wrong on these issue repeatedly over the last 80 years, more or less.

I care very precisely and very specifically about the lives of my children. A future in which they or their children are a persecuted minority because of their culture, ethnicity or race should be unthinkable, but it isn’t. And I’m sorry, but the weak suggestion that I don’t need to worry because it’s as likely as Star Trek, that democracies exist, and that Obama didn’t back gay marriage doesn’t cut it*, coming from the same people who told us immigration would not meaningfully change the face of the country or continent.

ukpolitics,comment,UKIP,ixi41jr,Xezshibole,,"This is an opportune time to take it and not suffer effects of walling off England, all due to one key reason.

UK, and definitely England, cannot and will not properly check Single Market goods well into the foreseeable future. It's waving in SM goods as if it were still in SM, largely because checks cause delays, lowering trade flow. It's the flow of goods, most prominently food. In short, properly implementing the checks would trigger an immediate food shortage, hence the government preferring this even as opening UK market to near seamless EU flow while not getting it reciprocated is deeply disadvantageous to UK businesses.

Scotland in contrast has pledged to rejoin the full EU. Though that may or may not be quick, rejoining the Single Market and Customs Union is definitely quicker and a prerequisite to the EU anyways.

When Scotland rejoins SM and sets up a hard border between the two, England is forced to wave in Scottish goods as it is doing with other Single Market members or discriminate against a SM member. And we all saw how the EU reacted to that during the Trump trade wars. Meaning Scotland keeps most if not all its market share in England as SM and Northern Ireland have.

Meanwhile Scotland walls off English exports into Scotland, substituting it with SM/NI/Scottish goods just as Northern Ireland has done.

In exchange for all of this, Scotland regains *seamless* access to a 460 million sized market.

For the record Northern Ireland is the best performing region in the UK right now, with a nonfunctioning government to boot. They manage this precisely because the SM is so important to the economy, they maintain most of their pre-Brexit market share in England as SM has done, and there's so much former UK market share in SM, NI, and now Scotland to expand into.

Edit: Seems like someone below is so thin skinned they blocked me before I could reply. No matter.

>if England wanted to increase checks 10000x on goods entering on the EU Scottish border (vs. say the French) to punish Scottish exporters it would be perfectly within its rights to do so

And it would perfectly be within the rights of all other SM members to sanction England for discriminating against one of their own. And as we can see from the current and future *voluntary* unequal border arrangements, SM needs the UK a *lot* less than the other way around.",2022-11-23T16:45:12+00:00,t1_ixhfj1w,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It’s not a “reward” to let them stay in this country. It’s just basic decency. Some of them want to be here because they have family or friends here. Some want to be here because they can speak the language and it’s already terrifying being uprooted from your home and having your whole life go up in flames without having the additional stress of not understanding what is going on because you can’t speak the language. Some of them want to come to the U.K. because they feel unsafe in the country they ended up in. 

There are no legal routes from Europe to the U.K.

If you want to stop people crossing illegally, you have to make legal routes. 

I was listening to the founder of the Say it Loud charity - a gay Ugandan man who came to the U.K. as a student and was tortured when he went back to Uganda because of his sexuality. He had six months on his U.K. visa so he just flew back to the U.K. and stayed as an illegal immigrant here for five years because the U.K. didn’t recognise asylum on the basis of sexuality in those days. 

People trying to come to the U.K. are not necessarily people unfamiliar with the country. Lots of people from countries like Syria used to be affluent enough to travel. Some might have been here for university. Some might still have links to the community and are pinning their hopes on that. Some might know people working in asylum charities here. Is it enough to risk your life? 

Maybe not for you, or for me. But living in a war zone can do strange things to your perception of risk. Let’s not forget these people are severely traumatised in many cases.

Unfortunately now we have left, not only are the brexiteers pointing out all the shit still happening, but bremainers are shouting about all the bad shit they are doing to us. Which is pushing those on the fence further away.


Like the whole disabled parking thing. About 10/40 countries decided that the UK disabled badge might not give people the same privileges.

Brmainers are like ""look, if we were in, this wouldn't be a problem""

Brexiteers are like ""it is only a problem because those countries made it a problem. Weren't you telling me the great thing about the eu is harmonised rules and no one country can do what they want? Isn't that exactly what is happening here 10 countries doing what they want. So what's the point of it again""

Why has it ruined the country? Because about a third want out, a third want in and a third don't care. If you could slice that up per region, we would probably be having a civil war.

So, the government, which everyone now hates for giving massive tax breaks to the rich, being rich or ignoring their own rules and having a piss up while other people were dying alone, is trying to govern a country where 2 thirds of it hate the other 2 thirds for disagreeing with them.

Overall if they hadn't screwed up the covid response so bad, we could be winning right now. The rest of the EU should be almost bankrupted by the freak weather and taking refugees from ukraine in mid east. Both of those things have affected us a lot less than many other countries.


Putin taking Ukraine was a master stroke. Climate change has destroyed harvests, so he's taken a whole country that is reasonably unaffected and has a LOT of farmland.

unitedkingdom,post,warming,3s561d,SweatyBadgers,Top economist says the cost of living would fall by 8% on day one if we left the EU,"> A professor of Applied Economics at Cardiff Business School has blown the lid open on the debate surrounding Britain’s membership of the European Union (EU) by revealing in testimony to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs select committee that the cost of living for those in the United Kingdom would drop by eight per cent “on day one” if Britain leaves the EU.

> The session on the costs and benefits of the UK’s membership of the European Union took place on November 3rd, during which several participants were asked to submit evidence on the subject. Prof. Patrick Minford of Cardiff Business School opened up a new front for anti-EU campaigners by revealing that Britain would actually be more well off as a nation if we left the EU.

> His economic modelling will come as a major blow to pro-EU campaigners who constantly warn that Britain’s economic security is threatened by a Brexit.

> Prof. Minford, who spoke at length about global free trade, said: “What people are saying is that if we leave the EU it is disastrous, because we’ll lose leverage, blah blah blah. But the truth is we’ll move, if we’ve got any sense, to a liberalised economy, fundamentally under free trade.

> “It isn’t in our interest not to have free trade,” he added, before skewering the pro-EU arguments.

> “It pays us to be a global player under free trade. It pays us to sell our goods to other people in the world market and to take their goods at world prices. That will lower our cost of living.

> **“We have actually done a simulation of leaving the EU and the first thing that comes out is an eight per cent drop in the cost of living on day one. Because of the move from EU prices to world prices. Now that is really worth having.”**

> Prof. Minford, who is a world renowned economist, was even educated at the pro-EU London School of Economics, as well as Balliol College at Oxford University.

> His comments have been warmly received from anti-EU campaigners.

> Andy Wigmore of the Leave.EU campaign told Breitbart London: “This is just another illustration of how big business the their lobbyists just don’t get. It blows the myth that we will be worse off out the EU, and it’s about time they started being honest about it.”

>The problem isn't too many humans it's a small percentage and the economic system they built that chases profits at the expense of all else.

I agree that rampant consumerism is also the problem. With half as many people, and nearly clean electricity, they would just mine more bitcoins until the Earth was reduced to ash. To be clear I should have mentioned that all of the green, sustainable and responsible policies should still be pursued. It is not enough to have less people. A change of attitude is needed. My point was that if these policies were adopted, I dont think the current population would be sustainable. Hence why overpopulation makes it uneconomical to pursue these green policies.

ukpolitics,post,warming,r238nf,tyroncs,David Goodhart in 'The Road to Somewhere' on refugees,"Numbers could get far higher. There is the apparent paradox that as
poorer countries get richer they develop a larger middle class, many of
whom are desperate to leave and often have the means to do so. The gulf in
income and stability between rich and poor places will remain for many
decades or even centuries. Professor Dani Rodrik points out that poor
people in rich countries (meaning the bottom 10 per cent) are three times
richer than rich people in poor countries (meaning the top 10 per cent).3
Moreover, as Ivan Krastev observes: ‘The spread of the internet has
made it possible for young Africans and Afghans to see with one click of a
mouse how Europeans live. People no longer compare their lives with those
of their neighbours but with the planet’s most prosperous inhabitants. They
dream not of the future but of other places’.4

There are also unknowable factors relating to future conflicts or the
effects of global warming on poor countries. Africa’s population is
currently a little over 1 billion and it is expected to stabilise at anywhere
between 3 billion and 4.5 billion—if it stabilises at the higher number, or
even higher, it may produce unstoppable pressures to move.
Thanks to its geographical position Britain was partly insulated from the
European refugee crisis of 2015/2016 (though asylum claims rose to over
40,000 in the year to September 2016 making it the sixth highest recipient
in the EU). But British governments have been arguing, rightly, that seeking
to protect someone who may be in danger or in a war zone does not
necessarily require offering them a place to live in Britain or a similar rich
county. Instead Britain has put money, more than £1 billion in the last two
years, into improving refugee camps in the Middle East and elsewhere,
from where small numbers of the most vulnerable can be selected and
brought to Britain.

Rich, liberal, Christian countries like Britain feel a moral obligation to
suffering humanity—both politicians and the general public. But there are
many ways in which those obligations can be fulfilled—through foreign aid
to poor and fragile states, through helping countries to trade their way out
of poverty, through military intervention to restore order, and through
providing either temporary or permanent refuge to people in trouble.
Too much emphasis has been placed on this last method for helping the
desperate: we have the resources and technology to help at a distance. We
can fulfill our moral obligations without disrupting our own societies and
tempting the most able and dynamic people from the poor societies that
desperately need them. And every dollar spent helping someone in a poor
country goes a lot further than it does in London.

For decades the grounds for claiming refuge or asylum have been
steadily widened. The 1951 Geneva Convention, established during the
Cold War as a signal to Soviet dissidents that they would not be returned to
their countries, has been subject to constant legal evolution and it has been
supplemented by the EU’s 2004 Humanitarian Protection directive, and
underpinned by the European Convention on Human Rights. According to
former Labour home secretary, Charles Clarke, there are now ‘hundreds of
millions’ who could legitimately claim permanent protection in Europe.
Such open criteria for seeking asylum could only be feasible in an era when
people were too poor or ignorant or too locked up in prison states like Iraq
or Libya to take advantage of this theoretical generosity.

In 2015 Europe’s bluff was called and about 1.3 million people walked
through Europe’s half-open back door (with some encouragement from
Angela Merkel). In doing so they exposed the promise to give shelter to
refugees not as a foundation stone of European civilisation, as the refugee
lobby claims, but as an embarrassing example of European hypocrisy and
wishful thinking.

We need different rules to reflect our somewhat more mobile times and
to keep numbers to a level that is broadly acceptable to European publics—
that means keeping the offer of permanent refuge to individuals facing state
persecution (as described in the 1951 Convention)—people such as African
opposition leaders, many Ahmadiyya Muslims in Pakistan or NATO
interpreters in Afghanistan—but not extending it to everyone who lives in
an authoritarian state or whose country is experiencing some kind of
conflict.

Britain, and countries like it, should also continue to offer at least time
limited refuge to those caught up in particularly all-consuming natural
disasters or conflicts like Syria. Though even in the Syrian case we should
select the most needy—not allow the most mobile and affluent to select us,
as we do now—and for the rest turn camps into decent, temporary small
towns with schools, clinics and jobs, where people can remain as close as
possible to their homes and prepare to rebuild once peace returns",2021-11-25T18:38:06+00:00,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Correct, **IF** which is going to be difficult as the UK as a whole has never looked so competitive and safe against the backdrop of other developed european nations.

>Trust me people know who Scotland is and find us to be far more likeable than the uk.

Yep because the world works on who is nice to each other, loads of people hate the US but they have to deal with it because of its size and influence, the same argument can be made on a much smaller level for the UK.

LabourUK,comment,climate change,h76spfn,Minischoles,,"> The last Labour government to do that, is spoken of on here as though it was some shameful past, to the absolute bafflement of the electorate at large.

The last Labour government also introduced the absolutely shameful ATOS assessments for benefits, began the demonisation of those on benefits, pumped the housing market bubble so that it's now impossible for the young to actually afford a house and brought in deregulation that allowed the banks to screw over an entire generation of 'the poorest and most disadvantaged' with stagnant wages.

Lets not even get started on the rabid authoritarianism of New Labour and the shameful actions in pursuit of the 'War on Terror', or things like indefinite detention, ASBOs, etc

Refusing to acknowledge the bad of something is some laughable centrist nonsense - nobody on the left denies that New Labour did good, but they also acknowledge they did a shit load of bad stuff as well - this idea that refusing to see New Labour as some bastion of perfection is what loses elections is just centrist whinging.



> The aim of a Labour government is bring in legislation that impacts the poorest, most disadvantaged, most discriminated against, thereby benefiting society as a whole.

And the current Labour don't offer that - we have a shadow chancellor that wants to be tougher on those on benefits than the Tories, we've got people like Jess Phillips and Rosie Duffield who are STILL unpunished for their rampant transphobia. 

We've got people like Trevor Phillips being re-admitted into the party, and party sources briefing journalists with horrifically islamophobic lines.

We've got rampant GRT racism being displayed with no punishment other than 'don't do it again'.

We've got a party that won't even back the Nurses Union in raising their wages to match inflation and make up for over a decade of pay cuts - that wouldn't back the Teachers Union when they wanted basic safety precautions brought in to stop them catching COVID at school.

Why with all of this, would I vote for a Labour government? At the moment all it would mean is the rosette on the winning party is a different colour.

This idea that it's about ideological purity is nonsense - it's about Labour, being a party for Labour, being a party for people and that means for everyone.

Because this isn't a serious forum, and I'm conveying my belief that the state supporting religions should be worthy of contempt because of the ridiculousness of their beliefs and their conviction that their way of life should ultimately dictate mine.

>According to your lifestyle? The state should represent and support more than just secularism in order to be representative. Furthermore, there are benefits to religious faith that just cannot be found in secularism - there is no secular subsitute for some of these things

I fundamentally disagree. The only way that the state can ever hope to be representative in this matter is to distance itself completely from it. Using public funds on Islamic causes comes *explicitly* at the cost of money that could be spent on secular causes, or CofE causes etc, etc. Hence why I later went on to say that your faith should be your own private concern, not that of the state and that this philosophy should go both ways.

Secularism is the only option here which doesn't seek support for any single group that wishes to impose prejudicial rules on others. There is absolutely no reason why you as an individual or individual group cannot facilitate these functions exclusive to your religion via your private worship and support for your own faith without having to burden the general population with financial responsibility for the upkeep of your favoured social group (which I do not mean in a derogatory fashion).

>But most importantly: This isn't a serious way to view or critique theology. I'd argue it's an ignorant one. The greatest of scholars have been debating this since the dawn of civilisation, and continue to. What makes you so confident? You've scoffed at the 14th century - can I read your takedown of its most important thinkers? Historical people weren't, er, stupid - we may be stupid in our ignorance of them, however.

The reason why I'm so confident is the same reason why I said we've advanced beyond the need to placate these people... The difference between the 14th century and today is that we have ready access to the scientific method and reasoned evidence which both disproves pretty much all religions' foundational beliefs and negates the need for any societal function that organised religion served. The scholars of the 14th century were undoubtedly vastly intelligent, certainly far, far moreso than I could ever wish to be... but they weren't dealing with the full facts, and resultantly, in the absence of scientific knowledge which we have ready access to, they were forced to try their best to rationalise reality to the best of their ability, using faulty logic.",2023-10-28T22:51:44+00:00,t1_k6vpxwm,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

If I have a budget of x, I can choose to build one nuclear plant producing y amount of electricity, renewable capacity producing 4y for the same money. Clearly, the latter is the faster way to decarbonize. And that's not even taking into account that realistically, nuclear plants are over schedule and over budget.

If that were the case, Germany's 2030 pathway wouldn't be so pitiful. Germany clearly has the funds to spend on such a ""cheap"" and ""fast"" transition.

>Be glad Germany took one for the team and kickstarted the renewable market. Prices of renewables have been dropping tremendously in that time period.

Hahaha, of course, we should all be thankful for Germany, who spews all sorts of pollutants and carcinogens (not to mention radioactive ashes) with their crappy lignite plants.

If renewables are so cheap ""thanks to you"" (of course, countries like China, which are the main producers of renewable in the world, don't deserve any credit), then achieve something better than a pathetic 230gCO2/kWh by 2030. *Then* we'll be thankful.

>The coal sector in Germany has been occupying a powerful position for a long time. Nuclear power in Germany wasn't willing or able to push them away in 5 decades, so really, why blame renewables for not fixing the failure of nuclear power in a single decade?

**Monday 12 March**

**Financial Guidance and Claims Bill - report stage and 3rd reading**
Creates a single body to help members of the public manage their finances, consolidating services that are currently provided by the Money Advice Service, the Pensions Advisory Service and the Department for Work and Pensions. Also gives the Financial Conduct Authority the power to regulate claims companies (like the ones that help people win compensation for personal injury), and transfers the responsibility for investigating complaints against these companies to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Started in the Lords, so if it passes these stages, it just needs the Lords to approve any amendments before it can become law.

**Tuesday 13 March**

**Spring financial statement**
This isn't a bill, but we've included it here because this is when Chancellor Philip Hammond delivers the government's latest economic forecasts. The Treasury doesn't want the event to be seen as a ""mini Budget"" (which happens in the autumn), so there'll be no red box, official document, spending increases or tax changes.

**Wednesday 14 March**

No votes scheduled.

**Thursday 15 March**

No votes scheduled.

**Friday 16 March**

Bans unpaid trial shifts for workers unless they're given feedback on their performance and told how long the trial period will last, what qualities they need to demonstrate, how many jobs are available and how they'll find out if they're successful or not.

**BBC Licence Fee (Civil Penalty) Bill - 2nd reading**
Decriminalises the non-payment of the BBC licence fee.

**International Development Assistance (Definition) Bill - 2nd reading**

**Electronic Cigarettes (Regulation) Bill - 2nd reading**
Regulates the use and sale of e-cigarettes. Also exempts them from any UK laws made as a result of the EU's Tobacco Products Directive, such as size limits on e-cigarette tanks and refill containers, requirements that they be child proof, and obligatory health warnings on packages.

**Criminal Fraud (Private Prosecutions) Bill - 2nd reading**
Relates to private prosecutions (when a private individual or organisation takes someone to court on a criminal charge) in cases of suspected criminal fraud. Details beyond that are scant because a draft hasn't been published.

**Affordable Home Ownership Bill - 2nd reading**
Requires the inclusion of rent to buy homes in the definition of affordable housing, ensures a minimum proportion of new affordable housing is available on affordable rent to buy terms, and abolishes stamp duty for rent to buy homes.

**Hospital Car Parking Charges (Abolition) Bill - 2nd reading**
Abolishes car parking charges at NHS hospitals for patients, staff and visitors.

**Universal Credit (Application, Advice and Assistance) Bill - 2nd reading**
A wide-ranging bill reforming the universal credit system (benefits for those who are on low incomes or out of work). Among other things, it requires the government to pay claimants within a month of a valid application being been made (subject to some exceptions), outlines minimum payment options that must be explained clearly to claimants, and allows terminally ill claimants to continue receiving payments without having to work.

**Courts (Abuse of Process) Bill - 2nd reading**

Allows Transport for London to regulate pedicabs (bikes with a trailer attached for carrying passengers). Includes a wide range of possible regulations, including licensing, fares, safety, working conditions and speed restrictions.

**Domestic Properties (Minimum Energy Performance) Bill - 2nd reading**
Requires the government to ensure that all domestic properties have a minimum Energy Performance Certificate rating of C (with exceptions). The deadline is 2030 for homes occupied by people in fuel poverty and 2035 for all other properties.

**Vagrancy (Repeal) Bill - 2nd reading**
Scraps the Vagrancy Act, a law from 1824 that makes it illegal to sleep rough or beg.

**Voter Registration (No. 2) Bill - 2nd reading**
Bans people from being registered to vote in parliamentary elections at more than one address.

**Kew Gardens (Leases) (No.2) Bill - 2nd reading**

- £80-110k of student loan debt, due to the longer and more expensive course. The repayments on these could be £250 ish a month once qualified.

LabourUK,post,tax rate,nq3a71,MMSTINGRAY,John Rees: The Class Struggle Under New Labour (July 1997),"I'd expect more of this from Blair as he continues to court Blarities

>Let’s take one small example of this process. In late May Tony Blair attacked the salary rises of the directors of the lottery operator Camelot. They were hauled before Chris Smith, the national heritage minister, to explain their conduct. At one level a properly cynical response to this development is quite right: it is cheap progressive publicity for Labour and, in any case, Blair is close to Richard Branson who wants to take over the lottery and run it as a non profit making operation (although the ‘consumer friendly’ publicity will generate lots of profitable business for the Virgin empire). Certainly it is right to say that no anti-capitalist intent is visible here. Anyone who claimed that there were such intentions would be painting Blair in colours far more favourable than he deserves.

>But that is far from being the only important argument about this issue. It is at least equally important to note that if a Labour prime minister attacks the salaries of the directors of one nationally prominent corporation it cannot help but give encouragement to every shop steward and union activist to make the same point about the managers and directors of their company. What seems like the promotion of illusions can turn into the inspiration for resistance. As the old adage has it, life looks very different depending on whether you view it from the cottage or the castle.

>Of course, it is only the fact that working class consciousness had already moved to the left before the election, and that this move was bolstered by the election result, that allows this interpretation of events. If there were no such consciousness among workers then Blair’s manoeuvres would never have effects contrary to his intentions. But as such a consciousness does exist much of a socialist strategy depends on recognising the contradictory impulses of Labour’s statements and exploiting them to the advantage of rank and file workers. Concretely, in this case, it would be a mistake if every resolution over pay and conditions in every union in the country did not make use of Blair’s attack on the directors of Camelot to sanction action against directors in other firms who have enjoyed similar rises over recent years.

>This kind of approach is all the more important because Blair quite deliberately follows an approach which combines either small reforms, the appearance of reform or the rhetoric of reform with policy which is wholly reactionary. Thus Blair talks of a ‘People’s Europe’ in which ‘there is less obsession with ourselves and our institutions, more focus on the things that matter to people’ but, in reality, he refuses to support the social chapter in the new European treaty unless if encourages ‘flexible labour markets’ (ie low pay and job insecurity). Yet these are the very things that most trade unionists think the social chapter will alleviate. Similarly, Blair’s priority of ‘education, education, education’ is already being used by teachers and parents campaigning against Labour’s plans to close schools, ‘fast track’ the sacking of teachers, and send in ‘hit squads’ headed by the very man, Chris Woodhead, who became hated as the head of Ofsted under the Tories. Or again, the government’s decision to lift the ban on unions at GCHQ can give confidence to every activist trying to organise a non-unionised workplace, despite the fact that Labour is committed to keeping the Tory anti-union laws which make the task so difficult.

>These contradictions are going to repeat themselves across the entire front of government policy. Blair and his advisers are keen to emulate Bill Clinton’s ‘tough love’ approach, described by The Guardian’s Larry Elliot as an ‘anomalous mixture of liberalism and authoritarianism. The Prime Minister will be Tony, just as Bill Gates of Microsoft is Bill, but the jeans and open necked shirt approach has to co-exist with ruthlessness ...’ [4] Peter Mandelson seeks to exploit this contradiction to Labour’s advantage, almost matching each reactionary policy with an announcement of some cosmetic or superficial measure which appeals to the progressive sentiments nurtured by Labour’s victory. The vestiges of political control may be removed from the Bank of England but, don’t worry, Labour will run an ‘ethical foreign policy’. Single parents will be targeted for ‘welfare to work’ interviews but at the same time Clare Short plans to ‘end world poverty’ by freeing overseas aid from being tied to business deals. Refusal to tax the rich is coupled with the windfall tax on the profits of the utilities.

>This public relations operation is already seen for what it is by a very substantial proportion of Labour activists. For some, doubts about Blair have not been alleviated by the scale of the election victory. And as time passes it will be the hard core of pro-capitalist policy which emerges as by far the dominant, and obviously dominant, part of the New Labour equation. The full force of circumstances pushing Labour in this direction will become clear when we examine the economic prospects facing Labour (see below). Here it is only necessary to note that Blair is ideologically committed to allowing the ‘full rigour of the market’ to do its work.

>It was this commitment to the market which stood behind Blair and Brown’s decision to make the Bank of England independent, as Larry Elliot explains:

>This change … underpins Labour’s technocratic approach to running the country. Once you have dispensed with the idea that conflict is natural – even healthy – and that there are [any] real class or sectional interests, the answer to every problem is to call in the experts. It makes perfect sense to hand over the interest rates to the Bank of England and to call in the head of BP as minister for export promotion. They are, after all, likely to make a better fist of things than elected politicians. [5]

>Since this was written Martin Taylor, chief executive of Barclays Bank, has been appointed to head a Whitehall team on tax and benefits, and Lord Hollick, chairman of United News and Media, has been called in to advise on industrial policy. Indeed Blair has been forced to admit that he has made more political appointments in Whitehall than the Tories did. He also looks set to have more unelected ministers in the Lords than the Tories, making a mockery of the election pledge to reform the upper house. In this world ‘independent’, ‘expert’ and ‘neutral’ are simply euphemisms for free market economics.

>Blair and Brown and the massed ranks of their advisers will stick to this element of their project long after the elements of superficial radicalism have been swept away. It is an article of faith among the Blairites that ‘corporatism’ was to blame for keeping Labour out of power for 18 years and, more broadly, that ‘planning’ was the root of all evil in the Stalinist states. They are consequently much more ideologically committed to market solutions than the previous generation of Labour right wingers.

>This pro-market stance puts them on a trajectory diametrically opposed to both the interests and the consciousness of the vast majority of people who voted Labour. Yet it would be a mistake to assume that, even when this contradiction becomes sharper than it is today, such a conflict will result in the Blairites giving way or changing course. One only has to recall the ruling classes’ free market policy, in particular the defence of the gold standard, followed by Labour’s Ramsay MacDonald and Philip Snowden in Britain in the inter-war years, to see that no amount of evidence of failure, or working class discontent, or even the wrecking of their own party, is necessarily enough to make Labour’s leaders shed their belief in the market.

>Moreover, these pro-market attitudes are much more than an economic orthodoxy. Every aspect of Blair’s social policy is riddled with the same assumptions. If there is unemployment it can’t be the fault of the market, it must be a result of welfare (described by new minister Frank Field as ‘the enemy within’). If there is ‘choice’ in the supermarket, why not ‘parental choice’ in education? And if ‘choice’ isn’t working it must be the fault of lazy teachers and failing schools. If young people are breaking the law the answer can’t be a job or a decent wage, it must be ‘fast track sentencing’.

>Even a commentator as sympathetic to the Blarite project as The Observer editor Will Hutton finds Labour’s orthodoxy unsettling:

>The Conservative vote may have fallen to the lowest since 1832, but the lesson drawn by some at the top of the Labour Party is not – in social policy at least – that neo-conservative approaches to welfare and work should be qualified. Paradoxically, they should be intensified.

>For these Labour zealots, Hutton argues:

>… systems of social insurance become obstacles to work because those who use them become scroungers and welfare cheats...welfare must become conditional upon effort, and offer no more than a safety net between jobs; if inequality results, it must – like death and taxes – be seen as an unavoidable fact of life about which the community can do nothing. [6]

>In both social policy and economic strategy the contradictions between the needs and desires of working people and the direction upon which the new government is set can only grow sharper. But even today, in its current unstable form, these contradictions open up opportunities for socialists, if they know how to take them. This requires that where Blair is at his most reactionary – in his Downing Street meeting with Thatcher, in sending the hit squads into schools, in freezing public sector pay – the left should unequivocally condemn the government and explain how its policies are linked to its acceptance of the very same capitalist priorities that the Tories were thrown out of office for defending. But this criticism will be all the more effective if we take some of Labour’s pronouncements as the basis for arguing against the government. Is spending £13 billion on the Trident missile system and another £3 billion on a new class of nuclear submarine, for instance, an ‘ethical foreign policy’? Is it an ‘ethical’ domestic policy when we are told there is no more money for hospitals and schools? If it is wrong for Camelot directors to increase their own six figure salaries by 30 percent, is it not also wrong to put an academic who ‘earns’ a six figure salary in charge of the commission which will decide the level of the minimum wage? Even before the election, an editorial in The Independent pinpointed exactly the kind of paradox Blairism creates:

>... New Labour’s bid to have capitalism and all its works without its ‘cultural contradictions’...strives to produce rules for social life when economic life is less rule-bounded than ever. The question is whether government can impose these rules ...

>Mr Blair would like parents to spend more time with their children. Quite right. Does that mean that he is in favour of maximum 48 hour weeks, or new laws to force employers to recognise the domestic circumstances of their staff? [7]

>Such arguments can gain a substantial audience now. The probable economic prospects mean that the size of that audience is likely to increase the longer the Labour government lasts.

On your point, say if i cannot buy a house or land, i then cannot buy somewhere to store my cars?  Im just highlighting a point. 

To add to your point. Im not rich. I just work very hard. 

>Wow!! What a horrible scenario! I wonder if perhaps there's an entire generation being priced out of city centres by people like you

I dont live in the city centre. Im talking miles. You know, folk like to be able to plan their lives, make decisions based off of it, etc. I might have had two kids and because its walking distance to school opted to work extra hour on the morning as i dont need to do the school run. Suddenly your government scheme has me swapping home with a family who also didn't want to move, my kids need to be driven the extra five miles now. I have to cut ny hours at work, my boss isn't happy, less money in, etc... Just highlighting a flaw in your ridiculous housing ""fix"". 


>What a massive sack of shit you are.

Grow up. 

>You don't want policy that prevents people falling into addiction by giving people better opportunities

I'd love to help folk, but not my hindering hard working and honest member of society. Tax more? Sure.  But force folk to move homes, relocate their kids, live in areas or houses they don't want to live in? Thats ridiculous.

A central question will be about your housing because prices vary dramatically across the UK. Your best option is probably to buy one and I imagine that would mean selling the one you have. So the value of your current home is important. Or whatever you rent it out for if you decided to keep it and rent here. 

It's easy to go online and look at houses for sale in the UK to get an idea. 

Another Redditor said that many people in the UK retire to the south coast. This is true but property there is expensive - Brighton is nearly up to London prices. 

Living rurally in the UK normally requires running a car. But I'd say you can do that on your budget.

There are various areas in Scotland that could work for you. More remote areas are lovely but living there can work out more expensive. Scotland has a lot of relatively affordable houses - away from the main cities. And buying a house in Scotland is very straightforward. In England it's complicated and messy. 

The cost of houses in Aberdeenshire went down by quite a lot because of the slowdown in the oil and gas sector. But it can be a great area to live in.

ukpolitics,post,tax rate,ffh5g2,callingacab,We're learning the wrong lessons from New Labour,"Many commentators here and elsewhere are adamant that Labour can only win the next election by returning to a more moderate program, or to what some describe as the “political centre”. This planar way of viewing politics is neither constructive nor accurate in any way - it severely lacks any nuance. Need I remind you how some of the Lib Dems' best electoral performances were during the New Labour years? Logic dictates that a centrist Labour Party should have cannibalised them.

Some clever people are frothing at the bit to bring up Labour's Militant years with Foot as a parallel to how a ""leftist cult"" condemned Labour to losing all those years ago. However, let's not forget the fact that his successor, aka the moderate Kinnock, also lost 2 successive elections, one of which was to John Major (the Theresa May of a past time). 

So what did Blair do that Kinnock didn't?

New Labour was an exercise in branding, first and foremost. It really was an overhaul of the party's image - at the turn of the millennium they were able to reinvent themselves as modern, metropolitan, cool etc - thus capturing the mood of a generation. Not only that, but they knew how to play the game - Campbell and Mandelson were ruthless when it came to spin in the media and were able to rival the Tories' network. Their policies were straightforward and focused to key policy areas with simple soundbites that resonated with the general public. We also can't forget how Blair sold his soul to the devil - by courting the baron Rupert Murdoch, who demanded from Blair that Britain would never rejoin the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in exchange for his support. But that's getting away from the point.

These tactics are not exclusive to the moderate wing of the party, though I do believe that those closer to the left may be inclined to look down on spin and salesmen tactics as the kind of slick politicking that they rail against. But I believe that this is where the party must compromise - not necessarily on matters of policy (though there is room for discussion) but on presentation. Jeremy Corbyn was a bleeding heart who couldn't understand how others didn't see the world the same way as him (full disclosure: I am the same). He thought tales of austerity and homelessness would be enough to win the hearts of swing voters, as he had done with the Labour membership. In an ideal world this would be the case, but this was not enough when we were already fighting an uphill battle. 

Some are convinced that pushing the Overton Window can only happen by starting in the centre and pushing leftwards from government. Blair it seems made no effort to accomplish this. And therein lies one of the main issues with New Labour - rather than trying to redefine the political landscape, it simply fought elections on Thatcher's terms. We all know how she described New Labour as her ""greatest achievement"". Blair had an opportunity to create a new political consensus based on community, social justice, putting people before profits etc. Instead, he consolidated the grip of Thatcherism on our system – individualism and corporate greed.  By endorsing Blair all the way into 10 Downing Street, the right-wing press played an absolute blinder - by legitimising a neoliberal Labour Party as the only true ""viable"" opposition, they would ensure that Labour could never appoint someone who would actually fight their hegemonic business interest in the world of media. 

The moderates in the party seem to fundamentally misunderstand how Blair actually came to power, as evidenced by their constant undermining of Corbyn's leadership [every single day](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/21/peter-mandelson-i-try-to-undermine-jeremy-corbyn-every-day). Rather than rallying behind a popular leader they decided to backstab him (or front stab if you're Jess Phillips) by resigning from his unity cabinets, challenging him in leadership elections etc. Through hubris, they fulfilled their own prophecy of Corbyn's unelectability. And they were unable to provide an alternative vision for Labour, presumably since many of them had no guiding principles or beliefs - they only sought to relive the glorious noughties whilst simultaneously criticising Corbyn for being stuck in the past himself, albeit in the 1980s. Those years saw some of Labour's worst performances - especially in 1983. The moderates back then wholly abandoned Foot's Labour to form the SDP, who joined up with the Liberals and doubled their vote share. Who knows what might have happened if the moderates stayed as a united front on the left? It seems like this is a common occurrence amongst the centrists in the Labour Party - they are unable to cope with not being in charge and ending up wrecking the party's chances. Yet the Left never abandoned the Labour Party en masse, not even after New Labour and Iraq. What I found abhorrent this past week was those critics on the right of the party saying that Momentum and the left had “failed those who needed a Labour government” implying that we had blood on our hands as a result of our “ideological purity testing”. Yet the moderates were all too ready to throw those same people under the bus with their austerity manifestoes in 2010 and 2015. And how can they blame the loss on the Left when it was those same moderates who were pushing for the second referendum that lost us key seats? 

I hope this gives you all an insight into why those of us on the left are hesitant at the calls for moderation. We’re not idealistic, navel-gazing students who all forgot about Blair winning elections. Our left-wing policies are popular, reasonable and credible; we just need to be able to sell them to the public. After all, it is their tax money we are spending. 

TLDR: People can't be defined on a left-right axis - People don't necessarily know what they want from politics - New Labour were salesmen who knew how to sell policies you didn't know you wanted - Current Labour are in a bubble where the policies sell themselves - Moderate politics are not inherently easier to sell to the public (Kinnock, Brown and Miilband lost 4 elections total, whereas Corbyn and Foot have only lost 3 between them)",2020-03-08T18:59:58+00:00,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

tories,comment,income tax,ftaoeij,Blakajac,," **Climate Change.**

> Do you feel the conservative party is doing enough to prepare or mitigate and lead? What policy would you advocate?

No, but some of the work being done is good. 

The energy markets have been nudged in the right direction and we are less rellianton fossil fuels for electricity than before, gas will be harder to replace though. This will likely require investment in better energy storage infrastructure, and there doesn't seem to be the willpower or incentive for this currently, one policy area that I would work on.

The flip side is that we are still not doing very well with transport and in the home energy use, driving cars and burning gas to heat leaky homes. To combat this I think we need to pull a classic Tory move and nick a few opponent policies on housing improvement and public transport (particularly rural bus support), both of these would also help those on lower incomes quality of life and opportunity. The combustion engine ban is a good step, but we need to get electric charging infrastructure  rolled out more quickly, particularly for homes and workplaces.

>An economy that grows 3% every year doubles in size in 25 years, do you think we can continue to expect to grow the economy in light of climate change? If so, how?

The UK has quite a service based industry, and digital/tech industries are growing. It will be hard to get everyone to pivot from fast fashion and throwaway consumerism but societal changes are happening. The energy market changes I mentioned should help the digital sector grow without parallel emissions. I don't think we can be 100% sustainable with growth as we need to vastly improve the reuse/reclaim/recycle structure of the economy, but we could be worse placed too.

**Wealth Inequality and Billionaires / Multinational Corporations.**

>How do you feel about the existence of billionaires and their contribution to the economy / the public purse, and from a moral point of view?

I'm not too fussed about inequality, the more important metric for me is eliminating poverty. High earners/spenders contribute lots in taxes (and some of them through philanthropy), and many fortunes will have been earned through hard work and risk. One thing that does concern me though is the power of ridiculously large/powerful companies, although the CMA does a fairly good job with traditional businesses e.g. ASDA/Sainsbury's, the tech companies are a different kettle of fish.

>What if anything, would you like to see the conservative party do regarding the ultrawealthy & multinational corporate tax avoidance?

Not sure on specific policy but it is a continuous cat and mouse situation to close the loopholes which will never end. Tax avoidance is fair game, tax evasion is not, international collaboration will be important to combat some elements.

**Automation.**

>How would you like to see society adjust to an economy that can support significantly fewer jobs?

Another difficult one, automation will also create new jobs in certain industries, so upskilling will be important, this is probably a weak point at the moment of the labour force, I think the Lib Dems had a policy of a skills budget or something. What we will need to do depends upon the rate and nature of changes, many jobs will still require the human element. If there is growth prospects/opportunity, businesses will identify what they need and that will guide the market.

I have considered the merits of UBI/negative tax, I think this could be a good way to A) reduce the inordinate bureaucracy of the welfare system and B) support a transitioning economy, but I don't think it would ever be a total substitute for work, and probably actually is more to do with welfare reform than automation, but that depends on the speed of change again.",2020-06-07T19:33:40+00:00,t3_gybrjg,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

But seriously, what little I have seen of Americans commenting on it, it seems to be that their media takes any chance to point out when there is an issue with the NHS. It's not a perfect system by any means, and there's always some way you can take some data of some sort and construed it to be that the system is horrible.

It's an extremely self centered world in America. Everything is always about the individual rather than society at large. Their mental health system is dog shit, why? Because no one wants to pay for anyone else, they don't seem to realise though that having a system paid for by taxes isn't going to be a whole lot different than just paying health insurance for a large chunk of people, but for a lot, it will be a whole lot better.

The difference is, in England, you pay your taxes, and if anything at all happens, you have medical coverage. In America, there's a whole laundry list of things that the Insurance companies will do to get out of paying, even things that aren't related - like, you break your leg in a car crash, but you failed to mention that you got a sprained wrist when you were 5, so your insurance is invalid, and you have to fork out thousands of dollars anyway.

Not only this, but on top of insurance, you have the crazy absurd prices of medication, which, from my understanding isn't covered by insurance either (I could be mistaken).

"" - Fair enough.  We'll just have to disagree here.  If the goal is for greater integration (which has been stated as being the goal quite clearly before the migrant crisis) then legal supremacy creep is how they will achieve it.  Essentially I view the supremacy argument as a gateway to greater integration, and if I dislike the EU now, then greater integration is the last thing id want.  Hence this becomes forefront.

While I may not like the existing government (I dont) and there is a good discussion to be had as to whether it needs reform.  There is no way that I would pick another government structure which I also think needs reform, and add it on top of the existing behemoth we already have.  The chance of any actual reform taking place reduces the further away you step from the system.  So I do not see the additional system of the EU as a solution.

Edit: I do think you're right about immigration simply being filled by alternate means.  Hopefully in the mean time they'll sort out the mess to vocational qualifications in the country so we can reduce reliance on foreign labour (im not holding my breath though)

If you don't have that much experience then highlight transferable skills and emphasise your willingness and enthusiasm to learn and participate in further training. Also make sure you include the specific trust's values wherever you can and look into information about your specific trust.

If you don't hear back from an application after a week, email the specific hiring manager and ask about the progress of your application and how you look forward to discussing why you'd be fit for the role should the opportunity arise. It could also be helpful to reach out to the hiring manager to ask any specific questions about the job beforehand.

For interview preparation, I strongly recommend the YouTube video I linked below as it helps to know what kind of questions to expect for a band 2 role. I've also attached one of the answers to one of my posts and its not the same job but the response was very helpful and they attached some band 3 interview questions.

But also don't be discouraged as there are a lot of people applying for the same role so keep applying. 

I hope this helps and good luck!

It’s a revolving door of patients, doctors will speak to someone for 5 minutes before releasing them. As a Police officer I cannot wait for the force to finish rolling out The Right Person plan because I simply cannot be bothered picking up the slack from the Mental Health services any more. They’ve absolutely ripped the piss for the last 2 years and if it hadn’t been for the Police constantly returning the people having breakdowns they’d have been exposed a long while ago. I’ve lost count of the amount of jobs I’ve been to where a CPN over the phone hasn’t been bothered and just said yeah safe to be left in their own care despite me telling them that this cunt just tried to  throw themselves out a window.

My favourite was a lady who spent half an hour telling me how she wanted to kill her infant child and how she planned to do it. Spoke to a CPN for all of 2 minutes who decided that because she said she was meeting a friend tomorrow she was forward planning and low risk and they wouldn’t see her and she could make her own appointment with a GP. Who the fuck does that and lets her keep the child..

I’ve lost count of the amount of Missing persons from Mental Health wards who I’ve had to find because the fucking door codes are written on the wall.

Scotland,post,Healthcare,fkesd0,coronacleanthrowaway,Dirty secret of schools; us cleaners aren't allowed to use disinfectant.,"Well, at the school I'm cleaning somewhere in the Glasgow area anyway.  Health and safety bullshit, a kid might lick a desk and get a tummy ache or rub their eye against a towel dispenser, so instead they've to get coronavirus because all they'll allow us to clean the place with is detergent.  

I asked my manager last week about getting us some actual germ-killing disinfectant stuff and he said he'd have to talk to the health and safety people about it, and that the school would have to approve it because of costs, and that we can only use chemicals that have been approved, and that was the last I heard from him about it.

So we're not allowed to follow the [NHS advice](https://hpspubsrepo.blob.core.windows.net/hps-website/nss/2973/documents/1_COVID-19-Guidance-for-non-healthcare-settings.pdf) of cleaning schools with detergent **and** disinfectant.  From talking to the other cleaners, it's the same at other places too, employers trying to follow [COSHH regulations](https://www.hse.gov.uk/coshh/) by only giving cleaners soapy piss-water to clean with, with not a bottle of bleach in sight because it's too dangerous these days.  Although at least one cleaner said at her other job, the manager gave in and got her some bottles of disinfectant to use, because you know, there's a pandemic on.

Now we've been told that there has to be a confirmed case of covid-19 in the school before they'll issue us with 'specialist cleaning supplies', but they're only testing people who're hospitalised with it, so there's not going to be a confirmed case at the school.

ukpolitics,post,Healthcare,18b8pd4,Miserable-Valuable41,On James Cleverly and Immigration,"It always boils my blood when ignorant people say that expats enjoy public funds or anything related.
James Cleverly has now said that only 25% of dependants who came with migrant workers such as care workers are estimated to be in work and that the rest are drawing on public funds rather than helping to grow the economy. These dependants are children and partners who are clearly not in work but also not aided in any way by the government! 
Can I  ask what public funds they are drawing on?
Sometimes I think that these 'people' know the facts and truths but go ahead and spew lies anyway, as long as it fuels the narrative people love to hear.

Firstly, let me start by saying migrant workers are not entitled to pubic funds. Not housing, not childcare and any other public fund you can think of. It literally says that on the passports. 

Secondly, migrant workers pay 'twice' to use the NHS, whether they visit the hospital or not. First, they pay for healthcare, in advance, for the duration of their visa. So for instance, for a 3 year visa, a family of 4 would pay around £600 per year, per person. Children around £450. This is nearly £7,000 minus visa fees.  Exact amounts depend on the category of visa.
Getting to the UK, the main visa holder pays taxes like every other citizen. And if their partner or spouse works, they pay as well. No benefits and no entitlement. They pay rent, have no access to child care except for the 15 hours everyone is entitled to. Even expats such as medical doctors (of which the UK loves to pretend like its only care workers who are imported) struggle financially due to all these high fees.
 So, my question is, does Mr.James not know these? I have asked myself this everytime a public figure has come to make this blunder. 
Wake up and know that Britain is profiting in every regard from immigration! They make hundreds of millions of pounds from healthcare surcharge,  visa fees and school fees of international students which are then used to fund the universities. All the while, the workers are earning an amount barely able to put food on the table after rent and bills are deducted. I cannot speak for asylum seekers, but just halt the lies about migrant workers. You need the people resource and make a killing while at it.

>The poor people in the south are paying yours.

Hah. Just what I imagined. You, as many other people on the Internet (and on local bars) criticising the Basque financing model (*el cupo*), seem to have no idea of how it actually works or what it entails.

**First**, the Basque Autonomous Community is self-financed, we don't take part in the collective autonomous financing (*financiación autonómica*), which is regulated by the Spanish central government based on the taxes collected by fifteen autonomous communities (as you see, Navarre and Euskadi are **not** included). The provincial governments (here called *diputaciones forales*) collect taxes individually for each province and then the Basque Government uses that money to fund our public services.

This means that we cannot receive ""ludicrous amounts of financing"" because the Spanish central government does not finance us, and that ""poor people in the south"" are **not** paying our healthcare, because we are **not** part of the collective autonomous financing system (nor are we paying theirs, at least not directly). This is different in Catalonia, because Catalonia **is** part of the collective financing.

**Second**, the Basque economic agreement (*concierto económico vasco*) refers to the amount of money WE pay to Spain each year in exchange of the services the Spanish government performs in our territory (airports, some railways, border control, military, etc.). Yes, you read that right, **we pay Spain**, not the other way around. Spanish nationalists have spread the ridiculous idea that we receive tons of money in exchange of nothing. 

**As a tl;dr summary:**

* The Basque Country has the power to collect its own taxes. They don't go to Madrid so they are not part of the collective financing. So, by mere definition, we cannot receive ""ludicrous amounts of financing"".
* The Basque Country pays back each year a set amount of money (1500 million € last year) in exchange for public services.
* The Basque Country **also** contributes to the intra-regional solidarity fund, that helps pay infrastructure and other services in poorer communities.

With the barrier to entry which is the need from a Work Visa, for EU citizens the UK ends up in the same box of choices as the US, Canada or Australia, and Britain isn't really more appealing for most than any of those places.

This happened to me when my cat was run over. We suddenly needed to get an urgent appointment and have her put to sleep on a Thursday evening.

My wife had authorised them to do it, but I'd not been told what the bill would be until afterwards, and if I'd not had the money I don't know what I would have done. 

Really vets need to improve their consent procedure, and advise their clients of the expected costs of their treatments, and any expected complications.

tories,post,Healthcare,e7e6hq,calculusprime,FRASER NELSON: Sturgeon's disastrous Scottish record is a foretaste of life under Corbyn," 

5 DECEMBER 2019 • 9:30PM

Like Corbyn, Sturgeon’s instinct is to intensify state control - Scotland provides the perfect example of the errors of a centralising tax-and-spend agenda

If Jeremy Corbyn enters 10 Downing Street this time next week, it will  be because Nicola Sturgeon has unlocked the gates. On his own, he stands  almost no chance of winning a majority. But he doesn’t need one, given  that Scottish nationalists stand ready to provide lobby fodder in return  for being granted another independence referendum. The most likely  alternative to a Tory majority is a Sturgeon-Corbyn alliance - and she  would be a radicalising, rather than a moderating, force.

Corbyn  has never had any great love for the United Kingdom, describing himself  as a “socialist, not a unionist.” Sturgeon doesn’t quite say the same,  but happily points out how much in common their parties have. At her  manifesto launch, and in the Scottish leaders’ debate earlier this week,  she paraded her credentials as Corbyn’s partner by counting the ways in  which her party practices what he preaches. Tuition fees? Already  abolished. Private healthcare firms? Kept a safe distance from NHS  Scotland. Taxing the richest more? The SNP are at it already. A  government-run “National Investment Bank”? Here’s one Scotland made  earlier.

She could have added that if English voters want to  glimpse what the future might be like under Corbyn, they should cast  their eyes north. Labour’s central premise – that the country would be  better off with more public spending and more concentrated government  power – has been tried out for a while now. As soon as the Scottish  Parliament was reconvened, its powers were used to reject the liberal,  market-based reforms carried out in England. Twenty years on, we can  compare the two.

We ought to start with schools. When I was  growing up in the Highlands, there was a feeling of immense pride in  what we all regarded as one of the the best education systems in the  world. The PISA international league tables used to agree. But the  latest data, out this week, show that Scotland is falling behind at an  alarming rate - with performance in maths and science at an all-time  low. School funding is far higher: for every £100 spent on English  education, £118 is spent in Scotland. It’s amazing what money can’t buy.

For all Sturgeon’s fiery talk, the real revolutionaries were Tony Blair  and Michael Gove, who allowed England’s state secondaries to apply for  independent status. Most now have. The idea was to pass power from  politicians to teachers. What they have achieved has been amazing.  England is now ranked 14th in the world for reading, up eight places  from three years ago: maths and science are similarly impressive.  Combine this progress with England’s university reforms - tuition fees  allowed a vast expansion of places - and the gap is huge. A bright child  from a disadvantaged areas in England is 63 per cent more likely to go  to university than their Scottish counterpart.

This is what  happens when you put the interests of children above the ideology of  adults. A cross-party success story. But Corbyn loathes the Blairites  more than the Tories, and proposes putting ‘free schools’ and Academies  back under bureaucratic control. And then implementing the sort of  curriculum reform that has inflicted such damage in Scotland. If the  Scottish system were outpacing and outclassing that of England, there  might be a case for tearing things up. As things stand, it is simply an  act of vandalism in the name of ideology.

I met Alan Milburn last  week who, as Labour health secretary, did so much to persuade private  health firms to enter the NHS and make world-class clinical excellence  available to all. He was baffled that his party now talks as if this was  a calamity. Sturgeon claims to have “protected the NHS from creeping  privatisation” but she hasn’t protected Scots from the worst drug death  problem in Europe, or from the chaos that has engulfed a new  super-hospital in Glasgow where children have died from dirty water and  other infections. There is simply no ground for arguing that private  hospitals are, in any way, something patients need to be “protected”  from.

Scots certainly get more money: health spending per head is  almost 10pc higher than in England. But that doesn’t stop Scots being  more likely to languish in A&E for four hours of more, or three  times as likely to die in a non-emergency hospital admission. The SNP  has missed six of its eight NHS waiting time targets, a new Glasgow  hospital is mired in scandal; the Edinburgh Sick Kids hospital was  supposed to open seven years ago.

But like Corbyn, Sturgeon’s  instinct is to centralise and intensify state control. Her contribution  to law and order has been to merge Scotland’s various police forces into  one big ‘Police Scotland, regulated by a watchdog. The head of that  watchdog resigned yesterday, saying the system is “fundamentally  flawed.” But after this and every setback, the SNP’s instinct is to  think of new ways to centralise, to impose bureaucratic control and to  deflect criticism by talking about independence.

If big  government budgets were the solution that Corbyn makes them out to be,  Scotland would have none of these problems: state spending there is  already as high as Labour is promising for England. But the problems  (and public dissatisfaction) keep piling up: a poll yesterday found that  just 7pc of Scots think the NHS has improved in the last five years.  Scotland’s culture, cities, people and landscape make it still one of  the world’s best places to live. But better for those who don’t have to  depend on its public services.

When I was cheering on devolution,  in the early Blair years, my argument was simple: that Scotland’s  ingenious people, once armed with their own parliament, would think of  innovative ways of making the country work better. But the lesson of  devolution is clear: if you have a government that hoards power for  itself, the people will always be held back.

Now and again, it’s  argued that a Corbyn government might not be so damaging because  parliament would moderate his wackier ideas. But Sturgeon would likely  egg him on further - moving faster to hound out private health  providers, doing more to abolish state school autonomy. This is the  problem with ideologically-driven politicians: they tend not to be  deterred by failure. The best idea is not to let them get to power in  the first place.""",2019-12-07T13:16:10+00:00,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Because Parliament is sovereign and has the ability to accept or refuse whatever they like.  They aren't obligated to do what the prime minister wants.

Once again, supporting Leave doesn't mean you have to support Johnson's deal.  I think the majority of Leavers in both parliament and the general public only want to leave with a deal that makes sense for the country.  Those supporting ""just leave somehow, no matter the costs"" are a minority.

One interesting one is GPs. They’re pretty much all private companies. But they get paid an amount per patient to provide NHS services (in a similar way to dentists).

You’re right though around competition vs no competition as a starting point. In some cases people just want a service.

A hybrid example with London Overground, Elizabeth Line & DLR services in London is that TfL pay someone to run the trains but they own them and the infrastructure (shared tracks with NR in part). I get the feeling this is the next step for National Rail.

This lets the public side do what it does well - acquire expensive things (shiny new trains) cheaply over a long period. And the private side hire and train the staff, make the trains run etc.

I wonder though what would happen in other industries where there’s a big risk. For instance energy right now.

Proposal for compulsory licensing risks ire of pharmaceutical groups keen to protect patents and revenue

&#x200B;

The EU is planning a compulsory licensing system to allow it to take control of the manufacture of drugs and vaccines during a public health emergency, despite calls from pharmaceutical groups to protect patents.

&#x200B;

Brussels wants the ability to act swiftly to manufacture vital treatments across the bloc during health crises such as Covid-19. The draft proposal from the European Commission and seen by the Financial Times is part of a sweeping reform of pharmaceutical regulation that has already unnerved the industry, and could change before publication on Wednesday.

&#x200B;

Compulsory licensing allows a government to force a drugmaker to share a product’s intellectual property and technical knowhow with other companies for a fee so they can manufacture it, increasing volumes and potentially lowering costs.

&#x200B;

Most legal systems worldwide allow for compulsory licences. But governments are loath to issue them lest they damage relationships with drugmakers and no comparable system exists at EU level.

&#x200B;

“Compulsory licensing can provide a solution to allow the rapid manufacturing of products needed to tackle a crisis,” says the draft proposal. “However, to guarantee that such products can freely circulate within the internal market and reach all those in need, the compulsory licensing shall be granted at EU level.”

&#x200B;

It says there is a “patchwork of different national rules and procedures” and products licensed in one country often cannot be supplied to another.

&#x200B;

The commission said the threat of compulsory licensing would also make it easier to make voluntary deals with businesses.

&#x200B;

But the pharmaceutical industry will argue that they alone should retain the ability to expand production of their own products, and would be reluctant to give up control to third parties. One industry insider said the threat of compulsory licensing would discourage future investment and not address problems such as stretched supply chains that developed during the Covid-19 pandemic.

&#x200B;

At the height of Covid-19, amid severe drug shortages and before vaccines became widely available, many campaigners argued compulsory licences should be awarded to allow nations to make drugs independently from their original manufacturers. One such compulsory licence was issued by Israel for Kaletra, an HIV drug that eventually turned out to be ineffective against Covid-19.

&#x200B;

In 2020, Germany, Canada, Australia and Chile had all taken steps or closely considered issuing compulsory licences more easily.

&#x200B;

The EU did not seize control of vaccines or medicines. But the commission became anxious about its supply of Covid-19 jabs, particularly after delays receiving orders from AstraZeneca. The commission sued AstraZeneca, demanding billions of euros in damages if it failed to hit its delivery target. It later settled the dispute.

&#x200B;

Ellen ‘t Hoen, director of research group Medicines Law & Policy, said the establishment of EU-wide compulsory licensing during a crisis would be “very important progress, not in the least because the regulation suspends data and market exclusivity — barriers to effective use of compulsory licensing in the EU”.

However, ‘t Hoen noted that a “general”, EU-wide compulsory licence system was still missing. She said the powers should be expanded so it could be used outside of extraordinary situations, for example to prevent a crisis, counter high prices or provide life-saving medication.

&#x200B;

Sergio Napolitano, general counsel at lobby group Medicines for Europe, said the increase in voluntary licensing agreements during Covid, for example between rival manufacturers, had proved to be the right tool to strike a balance between innovation and access.

&#x200B;

Napolitano said the move should be complemented by measures aimed at making Europe more competitive, including by encouraging EU manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, used to produce drugs.

&#x200B;

An early draft of Wednesday’s package suggested market exclusivity for drugs should drop from 10 to eight years unless companies marketed them in all 27 member states within two years of launch. Germany argued this would deter investment, while six other member states led by the Netherlands have called for the commission to hold firm to benefit patients.

&#x200B;

It will also attempt to tackle the shortage of drugs, with measures obliging stockholders to declare what they have and encouraging new production capacity. The proposals will require the approval of member states and the European parliament.

LabourUK,comment,Zionist,fzlrgqv,JeffB1517,,"> No one is denying the historic persecution of the Jewish people

To be honest you do several places in this very comment.

>  so we should build them an ethnostate on stolen land.

That was the comment I objected to.  The UK didn't build them a state.  The Jews built themselves a state.

> Why should the work not be done to fix the conditions they are fleeing, 

It could very well have.  Had the British in the 19th century considered antisemitism a serious problem and worked hard to fight it likely there never would have been a mass movement for Zionism.  In 2020 that's not relevant anymore the option isn't open.  Now with a few exceptions they are done fleeing, Israel is their home where they were born.  

> or even integrate them into Palestine without giving them dominion over another group of people.

That was attempted.  The Zionists were amenable to that.  The problem is the natives (Palestinians) were supremacist.  They objected to the immigration and they objected to the immigrants ""disrupting their cultural norms"" which were Ottoman and thus involved Muslim supremacy. They were quite right.  The Zionists intended unlimited immigration and intended to establish equality.  When the Palestinians reacted violently on several attempts the made the Yishuv stronger and then finally  were crushed by the Yishuv.  The British weren't the ones who ""gave them dominion"". 

>  They had absolutely nothing to do with the rise of Hitler,

That's correct.  They weren't the ones who started any of the various European antisemitisms.  They did something do with foreclosing the option of expulsion and so  why the Nazi regime ultimately choose extermination rather than expulsion.  They also  after the holocaust was over and knowing full well what had happened took the position that the Jews in the Displace Persons Camps should freeze to death rather than being allowed to move to Palestine. So let's get to the period of time when the events were relevant.  

Additionally the Palestinians certainly promoted the 1950s wave of antisemitism in Muslim countries which pushed the Mizrahi Jews out.  So if your criteria is ""started"" rather than merely ""facilitated"" there is an example of started. 

> We don't really tolerate this from anyone else in the world.

You must certainly do tolerate it all over the world.  There are governments all over the planet dominated by one of the tribes in the territory.

>  and to say we don't get to question it because the Jews had a rough go is beyond stupid.

Can you name one time everyone has ever said that?  What does get questioned is your right to make up positions Jews don't hold and then mock them for holding them like you just did there.

> Why aren't we creating an ethnostate for the Palestinian people in their homeland and arming them too? 

What do you think has been British policy since the 1930s?  What do you think the two state solution means?  

> Pretending that the Balfour declaration didn't happen, which lent legitimacy and also paved the way for the sale of huge amount of military hardware

The British imposed arms restrictions on the Yishuv. UK policy was literally precisely the opposite of what you are stating here.  

> [The Yishuv] had support and arms flowing from superpowers 

They most certainly did not.  Quite the opposite until the Soviets intervened and Czechoslovakia gave the Yishuv heavy arms.  Prior to that almost all the arms were smuggled or illegally built over British attempts to make sure the Jews couldn't defend themselves.

> Tell me why, today, we should be supporting a theocratic police state that maintains the world's last apartheid?

No one is asking you to support them.  What people are asking you to do is to treat them like any of the other hundred plus tribal regimes whose government you don't like and mostly ignore them.  

You are the one who is seeking to make them an enemy of the UK with (depending on your policy) an explicit goal of: territorial diminishment,  regime change or possibly total population destruction.  And then be shocked that the supporters of the state are outraged by this policy.  Much as you are about Tony Blair having similar feelings about the Ba'ath in Iraq.

1. Highlighting disenting opinions to relativise the ruling as a whole


2. Decisions weren't unanimous meaning any ruling is debatable, questionable itself.


In a ruling that concerns Israel, Israeli judge is possibly biased. In ICTY judges council could never host a Croat in case like Praljak, Prlic et al. nor could it host a Serb judge in Srebrenica trial.

How are you supposed to deradicalize people who are massively radicalized and live in a society where authority has currently become oriented around further radicalizing them, without seizing that authority and retooling it to push people towards greater tolerance and reason?

Remember we are dealing with a situation far more radical (in this sense, in terms of how deeply the radicalization goes) than even the Nazis and other fascists were in during WWII and after. It's not like we saw widespread suicide bombings and other acts of protracted insurgency by Germans after WWII, and that was even a situation where the victorious allies ethnically cleansed Germans from many areas like Silesia and Pomerania. 

After all the totalitarianism of the Nazis to establish complete control over society, and the hundreds of thousands of German civilians killed when allies carpet bombed German cities, and the rapes and butchery of the Red Army, and the expulsions of German civilians, the German people... basically accepted that it was necessary to give up and accept a new way of life under the authority of the victorious allies

Whereas in the Israeli/Palestine conflict, Palestine has waged multiple aggressive wars and attacks against the Jewish state, with the desire to destroy the Jewish state and massacre it's people, and despite being crushed each time, they keep rising up again and again to keep futilely trying to erase the Jewish state.

Because it makes people feel like that they're doing something.  And because they don't agree with your interpretation of what the purpose of the rally is.

>even on this surface level 'spread awareness' vibe, the IDF have killed immeasurably more civilians and children in this conflict, never mind over the decades, 

While I think that Israel *probably* have killed more civilians & children in the conflict, I don't think you can say that it's definitely true.  Hamas have already proven with that hospital story (where they claimed that 500 people had been killed in an Israeli strike on a hospital; it turned out to be a hospital car-park that was hit by a Hamas rocket that went wrong, and it definitely didn't kill anywhere near 500 people) that they simply cannot be trusted to report deaths accurately.  Nor do they distinguish between civilians and terrorist deaths - they just report them *all* as civilian deaths.

But even if Israel have killed more, it's not a fair equivalence, so it's not reasonable to use that as a justification for protesting against Israel rather than Hamas.  Israel strikes result in more deaths because Hamas go out of their way to maximise Palestinian civilian deaths by putting military targets amongst the civilian population, and therefore using Palestinian civilians as human shields.  Simultaneously, Israel does everything that they can to protect their own civilian populations as best as they can, by intercepting as many Hamas rockets as possible with their Iron Dome.

Those discrepancy in death counts is absolutely not reflective of their separate approaches to civilian casualties, and thus should not be used as a moral judgement of their actions.

>so even by this false metric one would expect there to be more protests showing palestinian solidarity than isreali.

There certainly have been more pro-Palestine rallies than pro-Israel; though that's mostly because British Jews are currently incredibly fearful of antisemitic violence right now.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Hamas,kbnsgic,TeddyBongwater,,"Thankfully the ruling elite and the CIA will never let Trump win again. It's why we are seeing him prosecuted on 3 fronts. 


I really hope my conspiracy theory is right. Here are the bullet points:

-The US justice system is controlled by the ruling elite. Remember when the attorney General in Florida was ordered to stop investigating Epstein 20 years ago or when Matt Gaetz legal troubles just went away. Or how politicians and rich CEOs never face justice. It's because the elite control our justice system and their are countless examples. 

-The elite have decided to use the justice system to go after trump. Yes he broke many laws and you could argue they are prosecuting him on 3 fronts because he broke serious laws,  but he had been doing that for decades. Things changed when they realized he had a chance to win in 2024. Why do you think it took so long to prosecute him for jan 6th and Georgia? Its because they were hoping to not have to go this route. 

-They opened a huge can of worms going after an ex president and Trump will retaliate against many of them and put them in prison if elected. This is the number 1 reason he will never win. They will do whatever it takes to get him off the ballot if there is even a 1% chance he could win. 

-Also, the elite know he will end democracy and that is bad for business and takes away their power. America is a country built on money and power. The people winning the game control the rules and they don't want this to change. Trump has zero chance of becoming president again and either won't be alive by the time the election happens, won't be on every swing state ballot he needs, or will drop out from the threats from the elite.

- If the elite don't take care of him. The CIA will. They do not want Trump to hand Ukraine to Russia and then have them attack Poland, Finland and other countries. They don't want him helping all of our enemies again either. 

They will let Trump grift a little longer, but everyone in ""the know"" already knows he will not be a real candidate in 2024.",2023-12-02T08:14:48+00:00,t3_187x3td,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

europe,comment,Israel,k7i1rof,budgefrankly,,"Facile nonsense. 

Ireland’s last 60 years have been absorbed by trying to find and keep justice for a (until recently) oppressed minority (Catholics in Northern Ireland) whilst simultaneously criticising terrorists (the IRA) ostensibly supporting the same aim. 

This isn’t particularly new: the troubles saw the movement for equality in Northern Ireland fractured between the peaceful SDLP party and the nationalist and pro-violence Sinn Féin party. 

Likewise in the 1910s, there were differences between Home Rule supporters and the nationalist supporters like the IRB. The former of course were betrayed by the British Army mutiny which implicitly endorsed and encouraged newly formed unionist militias like the UVF. 

So for anyone who grew up in Ireland it’s pretty easy to comprehend that Hamas doesn’t represent all Palestinians, and that all Palestinians, and their children, don’t deserve to be punished for what Hamas did. It’s also easy to see and empathise with the degree to which people have had, and are still having, their homes taken away from them by an occupier. Finally, it’s clear — given Ireland’s sorry history of sectarian conflict — that discrimination based on religion, no matter what the history, is not a means to build an equitable and peaceful future.",2023-11-02T13:00:36+00:00,t1_k7hnj5r,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
