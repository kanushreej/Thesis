PoliticalDiscussion,comment,hospital,ccr0b8s,pointyhorcruxes,,"Heard someone recently say that volcanoes produce more CO2 than humans. Came here to dispel that myth. 

2 C8H18(l) + 25 02 (g) -----> 16 CO2 (g) + 18 H20 (g)

For every 2 molecules of octane burned 16 molecules of Carbon Dioxide are produced. 

U.S. Department of Energy states the world burned 3.1x10^10 barrels of petroleum in 2007. This is the equivalent to approx. 3.5x10^15 g of gasoline. 

To find the amount in grams of CO2 this produces we can use stoichiometry and mass to mass conversions. 

3.5x10^15 ~~g C8H18~~ x 1~~mol C8H18~~/114.22~~g C8H18~~ x 16~~mol CO2~~/2~~mol C8H18~~ x 44.01g CO2/1~~mol CO2~~ = 1.1 x 10^16 g CO2

This says in everyday people terms:

You take the amount of gasoline burned (3.5x10^15) and divide it by octane's molar mass (114.22) 
>
3.5x10^15 ~~g C8H18~~ x 1~~mol C8H18~~/114.22~~g C8H18~~


you take that number and then multiply it by the stoichiometry of CO2 to C8H18 which is a 8:1 ratio
>x 16~~mol CO2~~/2~~mol C8H18~~

Then you multiply that number by the molar mass of CO2 to get your answer in grams
> x 44.01g CO2/1~~mol CO2~~ = 1.1 x 10^16 g CO2


Volcanoes emit 2.0 x 10^11 kg CO2 per year so:

2.0 x 10^11 Kg CO2/1.1 x 10^13 Kg x 100 = 1.8% as much CO2 per year as petroleum. 

Too long, don't understand chemistry?

Volcanoes don't emit more CO2 than humans use of fossil fuels. 

Why is this important?

CO2 is not a bad gas, contrary to what many people think. What is bad is *too much* CO2. CO2 is the reason the average temperature of Earth is not 60 degrees cooler than what it normally is. CO2 allows the heat from the suns rays to stay comfortably tucked underneath the atmosphere and keep us all warm. However, too much CO2 and Earth starts to feel like a green house in the late stages of spring. Even more CO2 and poof we look like Venus. Humans do contribute to global warming - and that is the major issue right now. The earth has natural recycling methods to rid itself of dangerous levels of CO2 like the rainforests and large areas of trees that use CO2 in photosynthesis. Rising CO2 levels coupled with increased deforestation causes average warmer summers across the globe and and increase in average global temperature. 

People don't understand climatology because science is under-funded in High School and people are scared of things they don't understand. Go out and educate yourselves about science, and the next time a climate change denier tells you global warming is a hoax - ask them to pull out their degree in climatology. When they don't, kindly tell them to go fuck off. This is my fucking home and I won't watch it wither away in the name of corporate profits because of lax environmental regulations and religion.

But in response to lifting the ban on gay service members, Congress began drafting legislation to ensconce the ban into federal law.  Not only that, they put language endorsing an absolute ban on gays in the military into military funding acts such that even Barney Frank had to vote for them or put the funding at risk.

> changing attitudes of servicemembers themselves on the subject   

That would have been super great!  Unfortunately, the military dug its heels in to push back in support of keeping the ban and the Joint Chiefs about lost their minds.  The evangelical right - which had been mostly engaged in anti-abortion activism - coalesced to support the troops in keeping the ban.  

> Wartime militaries aren't pre-occupied with games of smear the queer, they've got wars to win  

Yep.  But, back then the military had a despicable habit of pretending to be oblivious of gay service members if they needed more warm bodies to fight, then immediately discharging them upon their return from a tour in the war zone.  (Assuming they had survived, that is.)

GreenParty,post,privatized,hr9ma1,SwankyGravy,US Senate Candidate Savage Urges Ban on Facial Recognition Technology,"[US Senate Candidate Savage Urges Ban on Facial Recognition Technology](https://www.lisaformaine.org/ban_facial_recognition_technology)  


>Today, independent Green candidate for U.S. Senate Lisa Savage released the following statement:  
>  
>“Facial recognition technology should not be deployed in public, whether by the government or private organizations. In private settings, such as social media sites and in private establishments, everyone should always have the right to object to the use of facial recognition technology, and no person’s face should be stored in a facial recognition database without their express consent.  
>  
>“Researchers have found that facial recognition technology has a gender and racial bias problem. In a large [study conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/12/nist-study-evaluates-effects-race-age-sex-face-recognition-software), Black, Asian, and indigenous people were up to 100 times more likely to be falsely identified as white people. Black women were most likely to be misidentified. That may be a result of two things: 1) the public photos used to train computers to recognize faces include mostly images of white people and 2) engineers at tech companies are, by and large, white men who may be unknowingly designing the facial recognition systems to work best when identifying people that look like them. It’s notable that software developed in Asian countries does not have any problem identifying Asians vs. caucasians.   
>  
>“More worrisome, it recently came to light that Robert Julian-Borchak Williams, a Black man, may have become the first American wrongfully arrested due to a false facial recognition match. Williams was arrested by Michigan police on his front lawn in front of his two young children for a crime he did not commit because the software got it wrong. These are mistakes we cannot risk making, and that’s why there have been calls for facial recognition restrictions at the local, state, and federal levels. ",2020-07-14T20:45:54+00:00,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,privatized,fmdafud,Hij802,,"My main point is that this should be a federal law, although I understand state laws are much easier to pass. Also, I do believe that a good team of lawyers could make an argument to a higher (probably more liberal) court that current drug laws violate the 8th amendment, as they are ""cruel and unusual punishments"", however unlikely this is. A criminal record for drug possession can ruin somebody's life because they lose the right to vote, lose educational opportunities, and lose job opportunities as well. I think sending someone to a hellhole where they can get raped, beat up, stabbed, or even killed for choosing to consume a substance that wouldn't effect anyone but themselves is a very cruel punishment.

 [https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html) 

I think this link is a good representation of the prison population broken down. It is true that drug possession is not the leading cause of prison population, but it does mean about 500,000 of the prison population are there for drug crimes, primarily state and local prisons/jails. Again, nobody should have to have their lives ruined for being a functioning adult who chooses to consume a substance. But you have to think of the bigger picture. Lots of crime is based around drugs. Think about street gangs or cartels. It's pretty safe to say a good chunk of their budget and income is through drug trafficking. With that, comes violence. Most gang violence, such as murders, are usually directed at other gangs. Without drugs, many criminal organizations can fall apart as they lose their main source of income. The War on Drugs just fuels violence. Legalization will not only free many of those in jail for drug crimes currently, but would also reduce the number of future, more violent crimes from occurring, leading to even smaller prison populations further down the line.

As for your last point, yeah the country will probably follow this path with drugs as well. At some point many states will have legalized marijuana, and eventually it will become federal law. Then, I think some other states might loosen their other drug laws, and it will slowly build up like that as well. It's already happening at a local level - 3 cities have already decriminalized plant-based psychedelics. I can imagine that it will probably start with California or Colorado legalizing psychedelics, then slowly the other liberal states will follow suit, and eventually it becomes a federal issue.",2020-04-04T01:17:00+00:00,t1_fmbdill,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Libertarian,comment,hospital,hbxbn84,Lew_Cockwell,,"In an interview with the The Yomiuri Shimbun on August 5, Ozaki spoke in detail about his opinion that ivermectin should be used in Japan and said that his early calls for usage have seemingly not been heeded.  

He stated that there is evidence from multiple countries that ivermectin has proven effective for patients diagnosed with COVID: “I am aware that there are many papers that ivermectin is effective in the prevention and treatment of [coronavirus], mainly in Central and South America and Asia.” 

He also cited a paper examining the preventative effects of ivermectin regarding coronavirus infections in India. According to a study by a group of researchers at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, “Participants who took ivermectin prophylaxis had a lower risk of getting symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection.” 

The Indian study included 3532 health-care workers. According to the study, those “who had taken two-doses of oral ivermectin have a significantly lower risk of contracting COVID-19 disease during the following month.” 

In the abstract, the study states as a summary of the evidence: “Two-doses of oral ivermectin (300 μg/kg given 72 hours apart) as chemoprophylaxis among HCWs reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection by 83% in the following month.” 

Chairman Ozaki stated that despite evidence suggesting the efficacy of ivermectin, it is difficult to obtain the medication. He added that while ivermectin’s established effectiveness is increasingly clear, the U.S. company that manufactures the drug, Merck & Co., Inc., have currently limited distribution because they claim that the drug is ineffective at treating COVID.  

“With the view that it is not effective for the treatment and prevention of sickness, there is an intention that it should not be used for anything other than skin diseases such as psoriasis.”  

This has led to a situation where, according to Ozaki, “Even if a doctor writes a prescription for ivermectin, there is no drug in the pharmacy.” He said that this has rendered the drug practically “unusable.” 

He contends that the fact that supply has been stopped by Merck & Co. is evidence that it does in fact work at treating COVID: “But (Merck) says that ivermectin doesn’t work, so there shouldn’t be any need to limit supply. If it doesn’t work, there’s no demand. I believe it works, so block supply. It looks like you are.”

If you had cancer and were an Australian, you'd be able to get all the usual, non-experimental treatment at any public hospital in the country.

We also have a thing called ""bulk billing."" Some medical practitioners in the outback or upper-class areas don't allow it, but most health care proffesionals do. The government pays them 85% of the cost of their service, and they don't charge their customer. They normally allow this; more business.

But we still have private health insurance. If they're paying for you, you can usually skip over the usual waiting periods, and go to some flashy, expensive private place. The government subsidises them by paying 30% of the cost for you, and if you have a high income, they charge a 1% levy on your income if you don't get insured.

> The Republican plan to repeal Obamacare and delay the implementation of the repeal - with a promise to come up with a terrific replacement later - is probably its best way to destroy Obamacare.

> Fellow Republican Lamar Alexander says the same thing as Paul: &quot;We have to take each part of it and consider what it would take to create a new and better alternative and then begin to create that alternative and once it&#039;s available to the American people, then we can finally repeal Obamacare.&quot; Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas said on MSNBC, &quot;It would not be the right path for us to repeal Obamacare without laying out a path forward.&quot; And Senator Bob Corker is walking right up to the edge of the same position, asking Trump to tweet out confirmation of what Paul claims he promised.

> Maybe Republicans would call it &quot;Repeal&quot; of Obamacare and &quot;Replacement&quot; with something that&#039;s about 90 percent similar, but that would be symbolic.

You apparently don't know any rich people.  From what I've seen, the rich care more about value than poor people -- that's part of the reason they are rich.

> The entire rest of the world spends less on health care.

Correction: they ration care, either via quantity or quality.   That's not the same as 'spending less'.

> All other developed countries have better population health outcomes. 

Not after you adjust for genetic and lifestyle factors.

> For example, the USA has a high rate of diabetes related amputation.

Which has little to do with the quality of care, and much to do with the fact that we are rich, fat, and lazy.

Once that perception went from ""gay people are weird perverts"" to ""gay people are normal"" the legalistic changes (gay marriage, gay adoption rights, gay Americans in the military) could follow. Accomplishing this change in attitude was a massive undertaking, with television and movies slowly becoming more accepting of gay characters (e.g. Will & Grace) and trusted public figures coming out as gay (e.g. Ellen DeGeneres), all of which made up the ""face"" of the movement.

Then South Carolina.. Pete and Amy have zero black support. Biden will be in shambles by then. Who wins, if not Sanders?

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,healthcare,e2jco42,Waylander0719,,">There's going to be a large chunk of funding strictly for the programs administrative fees.

Fair point, though I believe the ammount of funding for administrative overhead is also outlined by congress. You are correct there would be administrative areas where you could possibly find savings.

>reduce the budget by only allowing specific items to be purchased

This is already done. You can't purchase:

Households CANNOT use SNAP benefits to buy:
Beer, wine, liquor, cigarettes or tobacco.
Any nonfood items, such as:
pet foods.
soaps, paper products.
household supplies.
Vitamins and medicines.
Food that will be eaten in the store.
Hot foods

>They will not have an objective to try and reduce the costs of the program due to it's nature

Who do you mean by they?

>These programs will continue to grow as the number of users increase, along with the price of food

The price of SNAP fluctuates depending on employment levels. SNAP spending as a % of GDP (so adjusting for inflation etc) has actually been trending down since around 2011 as the unemployment numbers have dropped.

https://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-the-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap

Also while the people running the SNAP program may not have as much incentive as you would like to maximise efficiency, they are regularly audited by the OIG which make recommendations and helps to ensure efficiency. Here is their most recent report I could find.

https://www.usda.gov/oig/webdocs/27601-0003-22.pdf

It finds that some states spend 2 to 3 times as much as others on administrative costs (because SNAP benefits are block granted to states which then either administer at the state or county level.). I haven't looked into it to much but wonder if these cost differences parallel cost of living in the states with higher costs (for example California is a higher administrative cost but is also one of the highest cost of living states.)",2018-07-17T12:23:08+00:00,t1_e2hyj7j,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Nice try though, but I actually pulled the numbers from--among others-- [Education Week](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2023/01). Hardly a bastion of pro-gun data reporting. I do, however, appreciate you making yourself look like a blithering fool right off the bat. 

Using the numbers from the Washington Post article you cited, we get an average on 15 school shootings per year. Even accounting for your obviously hyperbolic statement, 15 is a hell of a lot closer to 5 than the 365 we'd get with ""daily"" school shootings as you claim. 

Looking at the very first page of your source further proves my point. Look at the first couple entries on their list of school shootings. 

>Ridgeview Jr. High School in Pickerington, Ohio: A man shot and killed himself inside the school after being confronted by a detective.

>Geary Elementary School in Geary, Okla: A man in a car unintentionally fired a rifle, sending a round into another car on the school’s campus.

>William Penn High School in New Castle, Del: A 16-year-old fired a handgun inside a restroom in the school, leading to a lockdown.

Those are 3 of the first 5 entries on *your own source*, and since your link was paywalled and could only be accessed through an archive link, I couldn't even view the rest of the table. Those entries are incredibly consistent with things I've previously cited as ""school shootings"" here; a man committing suicide in a school that had been closed for months and slated for demolition. A gunfight between gang members where one fleeing assailant merely crossed briefly into an adjacent school's property. A school resource officer who had an accidental discharge of his duty weapon while on school property. 

The school shooting databases you folks love to cite are absolutely **littered** with such events in a blatant and transparent attempt to drive up the numbers and induce fear and rage. When we view the data objectively and consistent with what the general public considers a school shooting (Columbine, Uvalde, Virginia Tech...etc) we find that yes, we average around 5 of those events in any given year. You can try to hide behind your pedantry, but you're not fooling me, the public, your prospective voters and most importantly, yourself. 

Again, honesty and trust are important. How can your prospective voters trust you to solve the problem of school shootings when you can't even be honest about what school shootings are and their severity?",2024-02-09T19:40:08+00:00,t1_kotyj6s,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,privatized,dcgumg9,TheManWhoWasNotShort,,"Reparations is a difficult concept because different people mean different things by it.  For example, a government check to all black people.  This doesn't make sense because it's only a temporary gain, and has no long-term benefit except ammunition for people who don't want to actually tackle systemic issues to claim they've already done their part.  It also wades into murky water regarding descendants of relatively recent immigrants, black and white alike.

Others mean reparations by righting systemic oppression.  These folks I am inclined to agree with: our nation owes it to the black community to undo the disadvantages created by years of systemic oppression by ending the ways the system has oppressed them and committing to reversing the cycle of poverty.  I think that ending cyclical poverty is not only a noble goal, but it's  necessary if our nation wants to to continue to grow and not stagnate or fall apart.

However, the term reparations is itself controversial. If I say ""I want to fix school funding in low income areas to give those children the resources they need to succeed"", a lot of people can get behind that and support it.  If I call the same thing ""reparations"", a lot of people think I'm being racially divisive and trying to punish white people.  But, politics is a game of language, and how you pitch things is important. The word reparations and describing it as repayment for slavery will not play well to white America, many of whom did not have ancestors who owned slaves and hear the word reparations as a punishment.",2017-01-15T20:21:29+00:00,t3_5o1svl,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Medicare,d17uepv,ClockOfTheLongNow,,"> Your argument is inherintly partisan and far from the vast majority view of the country.

If you have an issue with the facts I've stated, please note them.  The only ""partisan"" viewpoint I've stated is regarding Bush's spending/taxation, the rest are simply what we know about the past.

> When we are talking about what is responsible we are talking about something that is a consensus view of how something should be done. 

A majority has been shown to want to allow a ban on flag burning.  That's not responsible.

If a majority decides that we should raise tax dollars so everyone gets a pony, that's not responsible.

Your idea of ""responsible"" is a family deciding they want to buy a Camaro even though the two breadwinners work at Target.  Sure, they *can* buy the Camaro, and the majority want it, but how is that really going to work out for them?

> Your view on government might be what you consider to be the best thing, but you cannot claim that it should be universally called ""fiscal responsibility"" as so much of the country disagrees that your views are the least bit responsible or safe. 

That's the beauty of it: it doesn't matter if anyone disagrees with it.  Taking more from taxpayers to spend on things that the government cannot afford in perpetuity simply is not responsible.  You can argue that we should do it anyway because it's moral/it's the ""right"" thing to do/social justice/economic justice, but it doesn't make it responsible.

To put it another way, it might be right for me to purchase solar panels and put them on my home.  It's morally good, it's environmentally good, but the cost of them and the risk involved does not make it *responsible*.

> The phrase has meaning because it can be universally accepted by Democrats and Republicans. But your version obviously cannot be.

That's the problem, isn't it?  One side isn't responsible, but wants to be considered responsible, so we *must* develop a definition that will accept both points of view lest we say ""you're actually not responsible.""

I'm interested in straight talk on this issue.  Maybe someone wants to be considered environmentally friendly, but they water their yard at noon every day in the summer while driving a Hummer.  Why entertain it?

> And when it comes to Bush, you can claim that him cutting taxes was good. That is fine, cutting taxes is not inherintly irresponsible. But what was inherintly irresponsible about Bush was the combination of lowering taxes while raising spending in a time of economic prosperity.

The spending was the irresponsible part, not the tax cuts.  Not all deficit spending is inherently bad, not all revenue declines are inherently bad.  What was bad was not even that he spent more: Iraq had an endpoint, but where is the endpoint for a prescription drug benefit?  Where is the endpoint for the 60% increase in education funding?  It's irresponsible not because of the debt it incurred, but because of the spending it puts future taxpayers on the hook for.

> The reason why Obama doesn't fall into the same inherent category is because of the disagreement on whether deficit spending is good or bad in an economic crisis. You are in a very small minority (in America) that it is bad.

No serious commentator considers Obama to be a responsible spender.  On the surface, his institutional increases on social spending combined with his tax hikes are enough to push him out of that for good.  He's getting a lot of credit for the declining deficit by people not looking closely at the why (a lack of a budget keeps the baseline low because his budgets have gotten very few total votes more often than not, and the ""unpopular"" sequester that he came up with but tries to distance himself from helped as well), meaning that the incurious media gives him a pass.

Libertarian,post,Obamacare,98gecq,James_Sultan,Is Trump the “most libertarian president ever?” (Discussion thread),"I keep hearing this idea that “Trump is the most libertarian president ever!” and so I think it is important to look back at some of his views/actions as president. I’m going to try to be as unbiased as possible in the list before giving my opinion. If I make a mistake or want to add something, tell me and I’ll edit this post.


Pro-libertarian:

Regulation rollback
Tax cuts
Tried to repeal Obamacare, but... (I’ll explain)
Has opened up to the idea of legalizing weed for medical purposes at least (or leaving it up to the states)
Supports school choice
Reduced funding for certain govt programs


Anti-libertarian:

Travel ban
Tariffs and subsequent subsidies 
Increased military spending
Families at borders crisis (“supposedly” an Obama policy, however)
Supports death penalty
Wants to make 3D printed guns illegal
...(back to the health care issue) he still supported public healthcare instead of scrapping the policy altogether


So with this in mind, is it accurate to claim Trump is the most libertarian president? And on the flip side, is it accurate to say he’s the most authoritarian?

To me, Trump has not had enough policies that limit government, nor do the policies that do limit government go far enough. I would need to see some of Ron Paul come out in Trump, like ending the Fed and IRS, and he needs to stop pandering some of his beliefs to the left, like wanting to keeping public healthcare while trying to repeal Obamacare and opposing 3D printed guns. Yeah, some of these beliefs are just fantasy, but I would need to see Trump actively fighting against big government and not half-ass the dismantlement of the parts of government he doesn’t like (for example, cutting funding for EPA instead of cutting it altogether) before I’d even consider him a “libertarian president.” Inb4 I know the constitutional limits of a president’s powers, but that doesn’t mean they can’t create a policy agenda going forward and discuss policies they’ll support with Congress.


Thoughts?

Conservatives,post,hospitals,17o2zgn,Head_Estate_3944,French Jewish woman stabbed in her home during antisemitic attack,"A swastika was painted on the door by her attacker.

A Jewish woman in her thirties was attacked in her own home in the Montluc district of Lyon’s 3rd arrondissement on Saturday, raising immediate concerns about an antisemitic motive behind the violence.

The woman, who suffered two stab wounds to the abdomen, was discovered with a swastika painted on her door. According to a number of media reports in France, while her injuries were considered serious, they were not life-threatening, and she was receiving medical care in the hospital.


Le Figaro, confirming earlier reports from Le Progrès, detailed that the attack occurred around 1 p.m. when an individual dressed in dark clothing and with a concealed face knocked on the victim's door. Upon answering, she was assaulted and subsequently rushed to the emergency room.

The presence of a mezuzah at her doorway, a traditional Jewish symbol, alongside the swastika points to a hate crime, prompting the Lyon public prosecutor’s office to suggest an ""antisemitic motive"" in their preliminary assessment, though not all authorities in France have yet to determine if it is considered an antisemitic attack.

As reported by BFMTV, the mayor of Lyon, Grégory Doucet, took to social media to condemn the violence, offering his full support to the victim and her relatives. Doucet's statement underscored the community's dismay and the urgent need for solidarity in the wake of such events.

The legal representative for the victim, attorney Stéphane Drai, confirmed on BFMTV that a complaint will be lodged for ""attempted homicide,"" highlighting a worrisome trend where expressions of hate are escalating into physical attacks. Police have taken up a position in the victim's hospital room to conduct their investigation and are working to track down the assailant.

Surging antisemitism in France
This stabbing took place amid growing concerns about antisemitic acts in France, due to the violent conflict between Israel and the Hamas terrorist group in Gaza. The hashtag #JeSuisJuif has emerged on social media, advocating for awareness and a stand against rising antisemitism in the country, just as it did in 2015, after the attack on a Kosher supermarket in Paris.

The judicial police, along with departmental security, announced that they are handling the inquiry, indicating the severity with which this incident is being treated. 

Last week, it was reported that France has witnessed a shocking surge in antisemitic incidents since the October 7 Hamas massacre in southern Israel. A staggering 819 such acts have been reported – nearly double the total for all of 2022, according to the latest report confirmed on Monday by French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin.

This surge has sent shock waves throughout the French Jewish community, with many expressing a deep sense of fear and dread reminiscent of darker periods in history. The sudden increase has raised alarming questions about the state of tolerance and security for Jews in France.

Chairman of the World Zionist Organization, Yaakov Hagoel, reacted to the stabbing and said in a statement on Saturday night: ""Antisemitism is currently inflicting brutality not just in Israel, but regrettably across the entire Jewish world. The Jewish people have endured persecutions, pogroms, and the Holocaust. We have come out of these attempts to annihilate us only stronger. Even in these times, we will continue to unite in our strength and demonstrate to the world that we cannot be broken. The nation of Israel lives on, strong and united.""

I imagine the loss of 40% of PP's funding would severely hinder their ability to provide those patient services.

Cecile Richards makes $754,166 per year, or 0.37% of the organization's yearly expenses. This compared to the average hospital CEO salary of [$595,781](http://www.healthline.com/health-news/hospital-ceo-pay-rises-while-americans-in-medical-debt#2)- and these are CEOS of single nonprofit hospitals, not leaders of a nation-wide network of clinics. Her salary is approximately 0.14% of the total federal funding the organization receives- perhaps if they slashed pay entirely for all executives, they could bring that up to 1%. Not quite enough to make up the difference. 

Approximately 12.7% of funds, or about $25.3 million, were spent on fundraising. Still not quite enough to make up that deficit if they are defunded. In addition, PP has long been the target of defunding campaigns. To them, money spent on political campaigns to keep the organization afloat seems like a smart investment. I'd hazard to guess that given the choice, they would love to redirect the money they put towards political action towards patient care.

Libertarian,comment,privatized,k7u1o5n,skeletus,,"There's a whole book on roads and urban planning called Strong Towns. It basically lays out the urban planning pre government. The book analyzes how the first cities in the US were formed before all these regulations existed and how they transformed into wastelands after the regulations were put in place. If there was no government, there would still be roads, but there would be much less roads. Under capitalism, resources are distributed as efficiently and humanly possible. Most of the roads we have nowadays are not needed. The urban sprawl is ridiculous and it's all thanks to zoning laws, building codes, car centric urban design, and more regulations.

Urban sprawl is literally unsustainable. The population density is kept artificially low. Low population density yields less tax revenue per area to maintain the roads and infrastructure. So, city governments expand the urban sprawl in the hopes to get more revenue from the new residents and use that new revenue to maintain the old infrastructure. This is a vicious cycle that spirals down to a very predictable point. This would've never happened if government would've stayed in its lane.

So it's not that there would be no roads, it's that there would be way less roads because we wouldn't really need most of the roads we have nowadays.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,healthcare,dwfk12s,AgoraiosBum,,"North Korea never let the boot up off the neck of its people, and it had successful successions that continued the same policies. Other states decided to reform (like glasnost in the USSR), or to incorporate significant market components to their economy (China).  Yugoslavia never had a true heir to Tito, and Milosivec decided to promote an ideal of Greater Serbia rather than the casual, decentralized socialism of Tito (so the founder died and the next generation of leaders took things in a significantly different direction). 

The three Kims have kept North Korea on the same path, and with the same gulag system. Because it didn't care.  When millions of North Koreans starved in the mid-90s, the Kim at the time didn't try to change the system.  the NK elite decided it was better to just let the people starve then to change.  The other states all decided it would be better to change. 

Also, Cuba is still ruled by a Castro. It opened up to Western tourism because it lost patronage from the USSR, but the communist party is still in control.  It was also never as harsh as North Korea (a low bar, to be sure).

Geopolitics,comment,hospital,i1s9jgh,TMWNN,,"> In the case of the Quebec referendum, it was determined that secession would require a constitutional amendment, which is by no means a simple task.

That's grossly oversimplifying *Reference Re Secession of Quebec*. Quebec nationalists liked the outcome because it found that The Rest of Canada *must* after a successful and valid independence referendum, negotiate with Quebec (or any province) to help make it happen.

Further, while the court found that a unilateral declaration of independence is not legal (or, more accurately, insufficient), it also found that the question of secession is a political question, not a legal one.

For why, this is important, think back to the 1995 referendum. It's now known that had the Yes side won, Parizeau would have issued a UDI almost immediately. At that point, whether a UDI is legal/sufficient is immaterial; what matters is whether the government and people of Quebec believe and act as if it is, and whether Ottawa will use physical force to prevent such an interpretation. No one really believed in 1995 that the federal government would use the military to prevent secession. At that point international diplomatic recognition is what counts; France and the Francosphere would have quickly recognized Quebec as a sovereign country (quite possibly the same day as any UDi), and that would be enough to persuade the rest of the world over time. Ottawa, London, and Washington would have come around eventually.

If an independence referendum wins in Quebec or any other province, the court has given tacit clearance for that province's government to, if TROC refuses to cooperate, unilaterally declare independence. We might see such a referendum passing in Alberta in, say, 2028; Ottawa and the other provinces (except Quebec, because even the most federalist government in Quebec City isn't going to set the precedent against such) refusing to cooperate in amending the Constitution; and the provincial government citing *Re Secession* to UDI. (Bonus points if you imagine a second Trump administration immediately recognizing Alberta's sovereignty. Even more bonus points if you imagine Edmonton and Washington also announcing the start of negotiations for US annexation.)

Bottom line: It's tough to read *Re Secession* as not a big win for Quebec or any other province's ability to secede from Canada.",2022-03-23T12:08:11+00:00,t1_i1qm302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Some of it is, some of it isn't.   


[Healthcare expenditures](https://archive.ahrq.gov/research/findings/factsheets/costs/expriach/expendria.pdf) are concentrated in a relatively small portion of the population who have difficult to manage, expensive chronic conditions.   


We need to do these things:


1.  Figure out of how to internalize the costs associated with diet or lifestyle associated disease: diabetes, COPD, HLD/HTN, etc.         Tax sugar or [fatty foods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_tax).   Or just [tax fatness](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/13/world/asia/13fat.html) directly.     

Rethink some urban planning -- make Americans [walk](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/blame-the-city/375888/) more.
