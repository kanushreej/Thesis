PoliticalDiscussion,comment,citizenship,d6z3on2,roland00,,"It has to do with personality and a specific personality trait that has most people assume have negative undertones (in pop culture but it really should not)...this word is called authoritarianism.

To such people with high degrees of this trait, all they see is they broke the rules.  ***You are now untrustworthy***.  Once you broke one rule (entering or staying in this country even though you should not be here), they may the intuitive jump that what is to stop you from breaking other rules such as murder, rape, stealing, fraud, etc.

You have already shown to be untrustworthy since you broke the rule (and are in this country illegally) and now you belong to a category of ""other"" instead of the category of ""trustworthy people / citizens / everybody else""

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

People have personality traits, and these things are crucial to how we view the world, and thus it is hard to understand other people who have different personality traits and they view the world in fundamentally different ways.  **You may never understand the other person's viewpoint (that illegal aliens equal rapists)**  Why some people see illegal immigrants as (closet) rapists, murderers, etc, *may not make sense to you*.  If it does not make sense to you just remember 4 bullet points.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

People who score high on authoritarian traits as a personality.

* Is a worldview that values order

* Is a worldview that values authority

* Is a worldview that distrusts change

* Is a worldview that distrusts perceived outsiders, especially a rapid influx of outsiders

Now having authoritarian traits does not make you a bad person, does not make you vote democrat or republican, all it means is certain things stress you out and without a specific structure to make you feel like the world is not going to go to hell, without these orders your anxiety influences your thoughts.

Vox had a good article a few months ago about authoritarianism

One of the things it points out in psychology we know that some people are pretty much ""constantly"" in an authoritarian mindset 24/7 it is just part of their personality.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Immigration,gq6usw0,MisterMysterios,,"There are two distinct questions here: Banning facial coverage during demonstrations and in everyday life.

During demonstrations, it makes sense. The fact that people cover their faces will create the problem that, if the demonstration turns violent, you have considerable problems to prosecute these elements that caused the violence. Also, the first step of getting violent is to cover your face in many instances, meaning that the police can disperse the protests on the merits that faces were started to be covered up, instead of waiting until it turns fully violence. (Disclaimer: I know the US has currently massive issues with police and respecting the right to demonstrate, especially from minorities. This is based on thoughts of systems where these kind of issues are less a problem. I am German, and the banning of face covering during demonstrations is based on this line of thought).

Something different is the question of everyday life. Yes, people in full covering are rather weired in an day to day life, I have seen enough of them, but it is their right to express their religious feelings this way. It is true that there are cases were women are forced into it, but there also many cases where that is not the case and it is their religious feelings that makes them wear it. It is better to go with mandatory education and similar methods to empower the forced women to make an educated choice and, giving the tools, give them the confidence to seek help if they are suppressed like that, than to outright ban a religious symbol.",2021-03-08T07:56:57+00:00,t3_m06h8k,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

* **Should the United States follow in Europe's footsteps and ban all facial coverings in public spaces?**

Not from the US, but from the EU. There are pros and cons of banning them, its quite complicated. 

Pros: Security, not allowing opressive traditions, 

Cons, restriction on religious freedom(when its voluntary), problematic in the age of surveillance

I am torn, but rather yes than no.

* **Are these bans inherently Islamophobic?**

No, Islam does not mandate full facial covering and it applies to everybody.

* **Are identity-concealing facial coverings a real threat to public security that warrant a legal responses?**

Depends on the location but yes. Revealed face and handshakes(as in no weapon in hand) is a sign of openness and trust, while covering your face can evoke feelings of distrust.

* **Should the government regulate what clothings their citizens may wear? Or should each individual have the agency to choose for themselves?**

Specific kind of clothing, especially one that is opressing or dangerous to society( aka ski mask in a bank, hate speech on a T-shirt) should not be allowed.

* **Should governments in the West be legally forcing immigrants to assimilate into Western society and its values?**
* Yes. When you come to a western country, you have to accept western values. You dont have to forfeit your own culture, but have to respect the core values western society is built upon.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Immigration,fm7bkhv,illegalmorality,,"On the travel ban, try thinking about it on a smaller scale, and see if the analogy fits.

Let's pretend I'm about to become a manager of a small company. But before I became manager, I say ""I'm going to fire all white people because white people are racist and they ruin this company.""

Then I become manager, and I do my best to fire most of the white people in the building. However, I'm unable to fire all the white people because there are some hoops I can't jump over (such as Trump's diplomatic obligations) that stops me from banning all white people.

Would I, a person who intentionally tried to direct blame on a certain group of people, be considered a bigot in that case? Even if I didn't accomplish the full extent of what I said I'd do, and I later backtracked on my own words by saying: ""oh, it wasn't because they were white. It was because they were bad workers! This is about work productivity, not racism!""

I'm going to tell you right now. If this were HR (and I've worked in HR), anyone who has said the things Trump has said would've instantly been fired for the things that he's said, regarding Muslims and immigrants alike. Because even if there's plausible deniability in *intent,* the consequences are ultimately the same.

The consequences are groups of people *feeling* like they're being ostracized.

And before you say: ""those people just need to stop assuming like that."" No, you and I don't get to decide how people respond. When there's a gay hate crime, which causes all the gays in the community to move out out of fear for their lives, it doesn't matter if the perpetrator was homophobic or not. The consequences are exactly the same.

Whether Trump *intends* to stroke the fans of racism or not doesn't matter. Hate crime has gone up since 2015, and Trump's rhetoric as president has invigorated the racist community.

Politics,comment,Immigration,l1gyn8b,malrexmontresor,,"That's a common misconception, similar to the lump of labor fallacy.  In reality, migrants are not perfect competition to native workers (that is they don't do the same jobs), but instead **complementary**.  That is, they complement the work done by native workers, adding to their labor, as well as increasing productivity.  They also create more jobs by virtue of being consumers.  It's also not always true that undocumented workers make less in wages.  In agriculture, work is often paid by amount harvested, that is per box filled, not per hour.  Because migrants are more efficient, they actually make more per hour than native workers.

Healthcare,comment,I-130,e3sr1fs,ImpressiveLock,,"I like your ideas! I would like for you to consider a few points (which you may already have!).

I think this would work really well for healthy patients who had no other needs than the routine care and the occasional respiratory infection. But what about when someone needs to see a specialist, or needs a triple bypass? They would still require insurance for those. Which first, makes people pay premium and your membership fees. On top of that, your services that are their out of pocket expenses would not go toward meeting any cost share their regular insurance requires. 

You briefly mention employer-paid insurance and wrap-around insurance, but if more than one person needed to be airlifted at any time, you'd be in the hole over $300k for each patient. Is that sustainable for your practice?

And what about health care reform? Insurances are required to offer Essential Health Benefits and cover certain amounts of the costs, in order to be a Qualified Health Plan. Individuals must pay a penalty on their taxes if they don't have a QHP. Would your plan be able to get that status? 

Sadly, I think you would run into people who abuse your system and over-use your office visits and seemingly unlimited available benefits, & for lack of a better word, gunk up the system?

I'm a Swedish-American (dual citizenship) born and raised in Sweden (long story...). Anyway, I decided to move to America and I got to say I am chocked. Here I was, thinking that I would pay something like 20% of my income in taxes, which is fine I wouldn't mind that if I get some basic service. I ended up in California and oh my lord is the taxes high. Keep in mind that I come from northern Europe, Sweden. The idea of the nordic model is that you pay a lot in taxes but you get a lot for it as well. Even though I love America and the life here, I just can't get around the fact that I will end up paying shitloads of taxes here while I get nothing for it. How come people accept that? Why don't people riot about that shit? I'm pretty sure that I, here in CA, will end up paying around 30-40% in taxes and I'm scared. I don't have any kids, I don't have a mortgage, what is there to deduct??? Do I vote republican to change this situation? Oh and being from a welfare semi-socialist country, I got to say that USA got a lot of similarities. Is the ""spend the money I earned on what I want""-mentality just a fantasy dream? What do you guys think? Isn't it a problem (big joke) that you get nothing for your taxes???

Politics,comment,Immigration,kjteun1,Okbuddyliberals,,"America needs to embrace the market, for immigration and other things too. But we won't do that - the unholy right left populist agenda won't allow it

If we massively increased legal high and low skill immigration (letting people work as soon as they got here), deregulated zoning and allowed corporations/developers to substantially increase supply of housing, slashed regulations that play a big role in obstructing new green energy, slashed occupational licensing requirements, and embraced free trade rather than tariffs, the economy would be so much stronger, with most folks benefiting, and with the ability to tax more without disrupting the economy as much in order to pay for more programs to help people in need, too

But instead we'd rather restrict. Restrict immigration because ""it's good for existing workers"" (it isn't). Restrict housing because ""it's good for existing homeowners"" (it makes their property values go up, but what's the point of selling your house for more if you also have to pay more to buy a new house?). Restrict trade because it's best for our own workers and foreign workers (wrong on both accounts). Restrict new energy construction because of nonsense like ""windmills kill birds"" (burning earth with climate change will kill many more birds). And so on. 

Capitalism and markets have been our strength, but now we are deciding to oppose them in all the areas where embracing them could help more.

Incentives should be put into place to raise the TFR to around 2.0-2.2. If needed, people should be aggressively taxed if they opt out to have children. 

In the meantime, while that generation grows, you have a 18-20 years waiting period where you would need to hire seasonal workers on temp visas. Poland does this with Ukrainians, Belarussians etc, employ for a few months and send them back. Also, keep up a permanent but restricted immigration policy for brain drain purposes.

He also treats people badly by calling them hurtful nicknames, and threatens people who have the temerity to dare to testify against him.  Is this his *”personality”*?

Again, Canada has good healthcare without threatening citizenship, the most basic human right there is, as a perk that can be revoked based on the actions of their parents. 20% of all Canadians were born outside Canada, and every single one of their children are and will forever be Canadian, the place of their birth.

Germany took in millions of cultural Germans from Poland and Czechia in the 40s and they got automatic and full citizenship, but people from Turkey which had been in Germany in large numbers since for decades, their kids in the 40s were not citizens. Nor in the 60s. By the time they gave them citizenship it was families three or four generations deep that had been living in Germany without citizenship.

That's what I mean when I say you reject universal brotherhood. You have more or less compassion based not on where they live but what their bloodline is. I have a friend who has never been to Ireland in her life, but because her ancestors were Irish she could apply for and get Irish citizenship by her bloodline.

That's the main difference between the hemispheres, because again it's not just the US. When you are from here, you are of here. Doesn't matter anything else, you are here now so we will make room for you. And if you're born here, you will always have the right to return.

This measure risks classifying very well-off people as relatively poor as compared to their elite neighbors. This would take scarce resources away from the real poor and give it to the middle class, just because they choose to live in a decadently expensive area.

On a broader level though, relative poverty should not be our focus. The greatest potential for the west to do good is to allow people in absolute poverty from the developing world to come to nations with liberal protections and booming economies. These people can be made far better off, and this is a huge way to increase the human flourishing on earth and reduce absolute suffering. 

But this might actually **increase** relative poverty! Poor people from the developing world without language skills often cannot get high paying jobs by western standards.

There was a point back during America's Civil War that many white abolitionists wanted to send black people back to Africa. It was the freed black people that fought staunchly against that and in favor of an America not defined by the color of your skin. White people didn't lead the Civil Rights Movement. Blacks did. The recipients of racism are the ones who fight hardest to hold America to her ideals. 

Considering Europe's history with fascism, it's understandable you just want immigrants to go away in order to contain the new alt-right. But you have to understand that immigrants are not the cause of the alt-right's rise. They are simply the scapegoat. If not for them, the alt-right would find someone else to blame.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Visa,cmb57ub,liatris,,"http://cis.org/immigrant-welfare-use-2011

Thirteen years after welfare reform, the share of immigrant-headed households (legal and illegal) with a child (under age 18) using at least one welfare program continues to be very high. This is partly due to the large share of immigrants with low levels of education and their resulting low incomes — not their legal status or an unwillingness to work. The major welfare programs examined in this report include cash assistance, food assistance, Medicaid, and public and subsidized housing.

Among the findings:

In 2009 (based on data collected in 2010), 57 percent of households headed by an immigrant (legal and illegal) with children (under 18) used at least one welfare program, compared to 39 percent for native households with children.

Immigrant households’ use of welfare tends to be much higher than natives for food assistance programs and Medicaid. Their use of cash and housing programs tends to be similar to native households. 

A large share of the welfare used by immigrant households with children is received on behalf of their U.S.-born children, who are American citizens. But even households with children comprised entirely of immigrants (no U.S.-born children) still had a welfare use rate of 56 percent in 2009. 

Immigrant households with children used welfare programs at consistently higher rates than natives, even before the current recession. In 2001, 50 percent of all immigrant households with children used at least one welfare program, compared to 32 percent for natives. 

Households with children with the highest welfare use rates are those headed by immigrants from the Dominican Republic (82 percent), Mexico and Guatemala (75 percent), and Ecuador (70 percent). Those with the lowest use rates are from the United Kingdom (7 percent), India (19 percent), Canada (23 percent), and Korea (25 percent). 

The states where immigrant households with children have the highest welfare use rates are Arizona (62 percent); Texas, California, and New York (61 percent); Pennsylvania (59 percent); Minnesota and Oregon (56 percent); and Colorado (55 percent). 

We estimate that 52 percent of households with children headed by legal immigrants used at least one welfare program in 2009, compared to 71 percent for illegal immigrant households with children. Illegal immigrants generally receive benefits on behalf of their U.S.-born children.

Illegal immigrant households with children primarily use food assistance and Medicaid, making almost no use of cash or housing assistance. In contrast, legal immigrant households tend to have relatively high use rates for every type of program. 

High welfare use by immigrant-headed households with children is partly explained by the low education level of many immigrants. Of households headed by an immigrant who has not graduated high school, 80 percent access the welfare system, compared to 25 percent for those headed by an immigrant who has at least a bachelor’s degree. 

An unwillingness to work is not the reason immigrant welfare use is high. The vast majority (95 percent) of immigrant households with children had at least one worker in 2009. But their low education levels mean that more than half of these working immigrant households with children still accessed the welfare system during 2009. 

If we exclude the primary refugee-sending countries, the share of immigrant households with children using at least one welfare program is still 57 percent.

Welfare use tends to be high for both new arrivals and established residents. In 2009, 60 percent of households with children headed by an immigrant who arrived in 2000 or later used at least one welfare program; for households headed by immigrants who arrived before 2000 it was 55 percent. 

For all households (those with and without children), the use rates were 37 percent for households headed by immigrants and 22 percent for those headed by natives. 

Although most new legal immigrants are barred from using some welfare for the first five years, this provision has only a modest impact on household use rates because most immigrants have been in the United States for longer than five years; the ban only applies to some programs; some states provide welfare to new immigrants with their own money; by becoming citizens immigrants become eligible for all welfare programs; and perhaps most importantly, the U.S.-born children of immigrants (including those born to illegal immigrants) are automatically awarded American citizenship and are therefore eligible for all welfare programs at birth.

The eight major welfare programs examined in this report are SSI (Supplemental Security Income for low income elderly and disabled), TANF (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families), WIC (Women, Infants, and Children food program), free/reduced school lunch, food stamps (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), Medicaid (health insurance for those with low incomes), public housing, and rent subsidies.",2014-11-24T01:06:23+00:00,t1_cmb56d7,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Yes you are. Anyhow, putting that aside, the fact that some people might abuse a valuable right does not make the right less valuable.

The vast majority of Americans (like me) got their citizenship by being born here. They didn't do anything to earn or deserve it, but they got it. The 14th Amendment was passed to explicitly do away with any kind of test or distinction that would deprive some people (i.e., black people) of citizenship by setting up arbitrary criteria for who deserves it because of their parents and who doesn't because they chose the wrong parents.

Without the 14th amendment, you get a permanent underclass of non-citizens where that underclass status is passed on by birth. At the time of passage, it would have been all the freed slaves who would have been non-citizens and their children would have been non-citizens.

Politics,comment,SSN,dw084mt,sarcastroll,,"In late October 2016 my wife explained to me to brace myself because Trump will win.

I laughed at her and told me she was crazy.

Then she told me of all the women she sees every day in the Western Suburbs at ballet practice, dance class, gynmastics, school functions, etc...

The ladies from Downers Grove, Glen Ellyn, Naperville- They absolutely LOVED Trump and hated Hillary.  2 of the little GEMs (Glen Ellyn Moms) clique were talking openly while at ballet with their kindergartners about how they are ecstatic that he'll get rid of the Mexicans in their schools.  (Because, yeah, there's so many Mexicans in Glen Ellyn.  I guess maybe I saw a black person once near St. Francis private High School?  But they were openly talking about that complete non-issue).  The ladies from Gymboree Wheaton hated Clinton, and the bumper stickers in the churches in Naperville had a lot of Trump.

So yeah, she sat me down and explained that she hears a ton of praise for Trump and hatred for Clinton.  And if the white, rich, educated women of the Western suburbs feel that way, just imagine how they feel in Dekalb, Decatur, or any of the 30ish counties in southern Illinois.  Now imagine how they feel in Iowa, Ohio, etc...

And it was then I realized how fucked the country was.  

And she was right.

So yeah, I've driven down Roosevelt road, I've seen the sea of yellow signs supporting Ives.  I've been on town hall calls with my rep and heard the praise for Trump.  I've gotten the Ives flyers on my door.

She's a little Trump and must be taken seriously.  I would have no surprise if this ends up being a JB-Ives win tonight (I personally think it'll be JB-Rauner, but I would have 0 surprise if Ives turns out the repugnant and wins).  

And if it's JB-Ives?  Good luck- the extremist base will turn out for her and JB will be dragged down by her building on the (justified!) attacks he suffered this primary season, just as we saw with Sanders-Clinton.",2018-03-20T18:08:58+00:00,t1_dw03gn7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
