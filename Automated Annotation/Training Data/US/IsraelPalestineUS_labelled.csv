Democrats,post,Gaza,1bd3uqh,John3262005,Democrats launch effort to force vote on Ukraine,"House Democrats on Tuesday formally launched their promised effort to force a vote on Ukraine aid, a long-shot bid to compel the legislation to the floor over the objection of the Republican leaders who control the chamber. 

Sponsored by Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), ranking member of the House Rules Committee, the Democrats’ discharge petition would require 218 signatures to force consideration of a Senate-passed foreign aid package, which provides $95 billion for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and humanitarian assistance in Gaza. 

The Senate had passed the bill last month by a vote of 70-29, with 22 Republicans — including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) — supporting the legislation. 

But the proposal has hit a brick wall in the lower chamber, where Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has refused to consider it, citing the absence of language to strengthen security on the U.S.-Mexico border.

To break the logjam, McGovern and Democratic leaders are hoping to find enough bipartisan support for the discharge petition to sidestep Johnson’s opposition and bring the Senate bill to the floor, where they predict it would pass easily with more than 300 votes.

Some liberal Democrats are already balking at the idea of providing more military aid to Israel — as the Senate bill does — amid a war with Hamas that’s already killed more than 30,000 people in Gaza. Those lawmakers want conditions put on that aid, ensuring Israel complies with international human rights guidelines. 

Across the aisle, meanwhile, even moderate Republicans — those deemed most likely to endorse McGovern’s discharge petition — are hammering the Democrats’ strategy of insisting on the Senate’s version of the foreign aid package. Those voices say no Ukraine aid can pass through the House without tougher border security. 

Hoping to bridge that divide is Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), who has introduced his own discharge petition designed to force a vote on a broader Ukraine package that includes the border security provisions many Republicans are demanding. 

That proposal has already won the support of a handful of moderate Democrats, who are warning that their approach is the only viable way to get more Ukraine aid to President Biden’s desk this year. 

Yet Democratic leaders are warning that Ukraine — which is under siege from Russian forces and running low on ammunition —  simply doesn’t have the time to wait for Congress to bounce competing bills back and forth between the two chambers.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Gaza,k6h72vr,rggggb,,"I would say pro-Palestinian people tend to be less informed and have very myopic views on the conflict. They think the underdog is morally superior simply because of their position, so when the Palestinians take back their land and murder and displace the Israelis - then I guess they will switch sides and stand up for them? Thats kind of like having no stance at all. 

Pro Palestinian people tend to be young and see the border wall but didn’t live through the images of blown up busses, weddings bombed, pizza shops bombed, etc. That relentless campaign of suicide bombings was what predicated a border wall - it wasn’t just like the Israelis one day decided to imprison Gaza as the pro-Palestinian would have you believe. They also do not really conceive of the millennia of persecution that Jews have experienced not just in Europe but in Arab countries as well, nor do they understand the commitment to destroying Israel that is shared among contemporary Muslim countries. 

I’m pro-Israel simply because there are many, many countries that get to exist unbothered on stolen land. It does seem that there is a bias that makes people focus on this conflict more than any other, and that feels very much like a hatred of Jews. I support israel because there is one tiny Jewish nation among 50 Muslim ones, 15 Christian, and 7 Buddhist. You KNOW that many of those nations have committed atrocities to defend or establish themselves. 

It is painful to live through and witness the birth of a state, but it is unusual how long Israel has had to fight to simply assert its own right to exist. Despite this, they’ve warmed relations with other Arab states. They’ve created innovative technology and birthed a vibrant culture by hybridizing many cultures of the Jewish refugees that ended up there. 

Furthermore, there are many groups of people that have been displaced and abused throughout history. They do not all resort to terrorism and many give up on their right to return like my family, who was not offered any right to return when they were displaced, they moved on in search of a better life. I find that the focus on Palestinian displacement is so disproportional to other global conflicts and it makes me very suspicious of why that is.",2023-10-26T01:10:44+00:00,t3_17gaj00,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

There was a massive firing of people at the RNC and a pledge requirement that you had to agree that the 2020 election was stolen to be employed.

Geopolitics,comment,Hamas,l6fns2e,EveryConnection,,"This feels a bit like a conspiracy theory where the guilty parties are identified beforehand, Netanyahu and radical Israelis who want to seize all the land of Gaza, and the reasons for the guilt are found afterwards, namely that Hamas somehow could have been destroyed with some sort of decapitation strike but this wasn't done.

What other factors do we need to make this true? Let's consider.

1. Israel's intelligence in relation to Hamas is so good that it has the ability to just do a decapitation strike and destroy Hamas' leadership with a minimal cost to Israel's international reputation and own troops, but Israel's intelligence about Hamas also was not good enough for it to know that October 7 would happen.

2. Despite Israel having that capability, the United States needs to either not know that it can do that (which is hard when the US has the largest intelligence community in the world), or be complicit with Netanyahu and the radical Israelis, even though this war has also hurt the US' international standing.

3. Hamas perpetrated October 7 while being ignorant of the fact that Israel could easily destroy them at a minimal cost to Israel, and only chose to make the war costly for itself for political reasons. I don't think the Hamas leadership could have predicted that Israel would make such a strange decision.

All in all, I think it's pretty clear where Occam's Razor would lie... that Israel is waging war, because that was the best decision it had at the time in response to October 7.",2024-05-31T05:04:49+00:00,t1_l6fm2gs,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I have some trouble imagining he would gain more support than he'd lose.

Geopolitics,comment,Palestinian,k4lhtkl,bxbb,,"Muslim here. Few things to consider:

- There's no continuous leadership and/ or organization that fight for Uyghurs national identity. Last successful attempt was pre-civil war era (2nd East Turkmenstan).
- TIP claimed leadership of separatist, but since they operate as cross-border group that goes as far as Syria, its hard to justify their claim. Compare it to Hamas and Taliban which focus their effort in their respective area of influence (Gaza and Afghanistan).
- Up until dissolution of USSR, Xinjiang separatism was backed by the Soviet. This goes against prevalent narrative of pan-islamist fight against communist influence (esp Afghanistan and Pakistan), further increasing the narrative disconnect.
- After CCP power consolidation, conditions in the region was relatively stable. Only deteriorating quickly after Ghulja Massacre (1997). Before 1997, CCP propaganda was focused on national unity and most trouble in the region was attributed to ""Uyghurs in exile"" and pan-islamist movement. Post-1997, the separatist MO shifted to terror attack such as bus bombing and suicide bombing. This coincides with rise of islamic extremism across the world, whose victim includes Muslim countries (JI, MILF, Boko Haram, Al Qaeda).
- Further escalation was seen up to its peak in 2014, and has been in decline since, after CCP's harsh response.
- Western media mostly focused in the narrative of Hamas as a terrorist group. However, they also capable of administering the region, going as far as [teaching Hebrew](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-university-now-offers-a-degree-in-hebrew/) in their university and [building amusement parks](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2013/06/al-nour-resort-gaza.html) for child of war victims. This gave them credibility as administrator of a state, which in turn make supporting the state of Palestine easier to defend.


To put it simply, we can support Palestine due to the existing national identity in place and possibility of alternate outcome if peace is attained. The same, sadly, cannot be said for Uyghurs.

Conservatives,post,Gaza,17t1jub,Head_Estate_3944,"Hamas Palestinian Official: If We Could Turn Back Time, We'd Do Oct. 7 All Over Again","Osama Hamdan said the assault on Israel was 'aimed at ending Israel's attempts to bring an end to the Palestinian cause'

Amid debate in some corners of the internet over whether Hamas terrorists targeted civilians during their massacre in Israel, or whether it was a legitimate military action, the leaders of Hamas are continuing to make it very clear: the Oct. 7 operation was a smashing success, in their eyes, and one they'd do all over again if given the opportunity.

A senior Hamas official said as much in a recent interview, responding to a hypothetical question by saying that if he could go back a month in time, the Islamic Palestinian terrorist group would opt to carry out their Oct. 7 massacre in southern Israel that left 1,400 people dead all over again.

""The answer is yes,"" Osama Hamdan said when asked about the hypothetical scenario in an interview published Tuesday by Al-Liwaa, a daily newspaper in Lebanon.

""The operation was not a momentary step, but rather part of [Hamas's] strategy which is aimed at ending Israel's attempts to bring an end to the Palestinian cause and to build local alliances that will remove the Palestinian people from history,"" he added, according to a translation by nonprofit Middle East Media Research Institute.

Hamdan said the ""greatest achievement"" of the attack was not just the damage done to the Israeli military and its ""true image,"" but also ""the fact that the operation ended Israel's ambitions to become a natural entity in the region at the expense of the Palestinian nation.""

The gruesome surprise assault last month that plunged Israel into war with Hamas in Gaza included a rampage through Israeli communities and at a music festival, where gunmen killed at least 260 people.

Videos captured by body cameras worn by Hamas Palestinian gunmen — as well as dashboard, security and surveillance cameras — shown by Israeli officials to international journalists and world leaders in recent weeks show Hamas Palestinian fighters murdering Israelis in front of their families.

Reporters described seeing images of burned Israeli  babies and children, along with other indescribably graphic scenes.

In testimony released this week, a Jewish survivor recalled witnessing how the Palestinian terror gunmen raped a young woman and shot her in the head as they did.

The Palestinian militants then cut the Jewish woman's breast off her body and ""literally played with it on the road,"" the witness said.

More than 200 other people were taken hostage during the siege and are believed to be in Hamas custody in the vast tunnel network that runs underneath the Gaza Strip.

In this week's interview, Hamdan said most of the hostages are Israeli soldiers who ""will be swapped in a prisoner exchange after [Israel's] aggression is over.""

He said other captives were taken into Gaza ""by various means"" – not by Hamas, but rather, other terrorist forces.

""Some of them have dual citizenship and some of them are foreigners. We have counted over 51 dual citizens,"" Hamdan said.

""Under the current circumstances we cannot count all of them, since they are not in Hamas's possession… They are not in our possession and are located throughout the Gaza Strip. Some of them are held by other forces, and some by other elements.""

So far Hamas Palastinian militants released only a handful of the hostages: two elderly Israeli women and an American teenager and her mother from Evanston, Illinois, Natalie Raanan and Judith Tai Raanan.

The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza has reported more than 10,500 deaths since the start of the war last month.",2023-11-11T19:18:24+00:00,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

It’s hard to do that when the strip is run by Hamas, and if Hamas is destroyed some other militant group will fill the gap and any aid organization will have to deal with them if they want to get anything done.


>aid reaches the people that needed it and not get taken by Hamas.

Hamas is also virtually the only group in the the strip that can reliably protect aid convoys even if they also stole from them as well. Unless you’re willing to send in an armed force with UNHCR it’ll be hard to prevent aid from getting stolen by criminals in the Gaza Strip as it is currently.

>Sudan, Ukraine, Syria. All had similar orders of magnitude of refugees

Neither of these refugee groups political situations were remotely similar. Sudanese refugees either stayed in Sudan or went to neighboring countries such as Egypt. Ukrainian refugees either moved to the western part of the country or to neighboring European countries. Syrians either stayed in Syria or moved to neighboring countries like Turkey.

Now that we've looked at the time period of 1980-2016, it's time to look at the present and the future. I'll try to stay as objective as I can in this post and mostly parrot what other turkish people around me think rather than my own opinions.

# Palestine, Israel and the Israel-Hamas War

The turkish view on this conflict has always been very complicated, because both Islam and xenophobia and racism against arabs are popular in Turkey. There are two extremes, and you will not get any answers other than these two if you ask a turkish person about this conflict. It's either ""Good, less arabs in the world"" or ""Israel are evil terrorists"".,

 With the recent Gaza Conflict, there were a lot of islamist Turks, mostly in more conservative areas, that boycotted western items, even going so far as to harass people sitting at Starbucks or drinking Cola. What that has to do with Israel, don't ask me. Meanwhile more secular turks have just stuck to ""Good, less arabs in the world"". For the future of this conflict, everyone agrees that Israel will win and keep winning, whether begrudgingly or happily.

# War in Ukraine and Russia's Future

The Ukraine War was never a big topic in Turkey, interestingly. I'm pretty much the only person I know that knows much about it. The Western view that Russia has messed up bad in this war and will never recover is denied by most Turks, as Russia is simply seen as too big and strong to fall. Most people also buy into the Russian propaganda that they're fighting NATO, not just Ukraine. Putin is seen usually as a strong and capable leader that's far more capable than any western leaders. 

Make no mistake though, Russia is still a clear enemy to Turks, as it has been for centuries. Russia is expected to eventually win, no matter how long it takes. Erdogan's policy of neutrality and trying to become the negotiator between two sides has been praised by most Turks, and even anti-Erdogan people usually say ""He's terrible at everything but good at foreign policy."".

# Sweden, Finland and NATO

As all of you probably know, on 18 May 2022, Sweden and Finland jointly applied to join NATO. Finland has been approved but Sweden still hasn't, and we even held Finland up for a long while. Why is this?  


Minor political gains for Erdogan, mostly. There is some stuff with Sweden harboring PKK terrorists but Finland really didn't do anything to us. The west has (in my opinion, rightfully) been pretty upset at Erdogan for throwing good will under the bus for some minor concessions. But most Turks think he played this well. But why?

Well, from a cold geopolitics perspective, he did. Turkey is indispensable to NATO. It is never getting kicked out. Turkey has the second largest military in NATO and is the strongest military in both the Balkans and the Middle East, while also controlling the Bosphorus, which completely checkmates Russia's strongest fleet, the Black Sea fleet. There is simply nothing the West can do other than accept Erdogan's demands as long as he doesn't go too far, and he knows it. As long as Erdogan is in charge, keep expecting these kinds of stunts.

Neoliberal,post,Israel,1bzcxpa,87568354,Trump has some deeply questionable policy positions and outright incorrect statements on his campaign website. Here’s a look at some.,"Everything quoted comes directly from Trump’s website: [https://www.donaldjtrump.com](https://www.donaldjtrump.com). In some cases, I have bolded certain statements that I take particular issue with. This isn’t about everything Trump endorses on there; I focused on what I think are the most objectionable or least coherent views.

>***Secure Borders and Reclaim National Sovereignty***  
>  
>President Donald J. Trump created the most secure border in U.S. history. He ended catch-and-release, took down human traffickers, deported record numbers of illegal alien gang members, and built 450 miles of powerful new wall. Joe Biden turned our country into one giant sanctuary for dangerous criminal aliens when he suspended all immigration enforcement in the middle of a global pandemic and reversed landmark agreements that safely returned asylum-seekers to Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. The onslaught of illegal aliens invading our wide-open borders threatens public safety, drains the treasury, undermines U.S. workers, and burdens schools and hospitals. President Trump will shut down Biden’s border disaster. He will again end catch-and-release, restore Remain in Mexico, and eliminate asylum fraud. In cooperative states, **President Trump will deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals**. He will also deliver a merit-based immigration system that protects American labor and promotes American values.

It is generally agreed on here that immigrating to the US is far harder than it should be, so I don’t believe that I have to elaborate much on why I find this section objectionable. I also don’t think it comes as a surprise for anybody that Trump once again wants to tighten the border. I suspect that empowering law enforcement to rapidly remove people will end up violating any concept of due process.

>***Renew American Strength and Leadership***  
>  
>President Donald J. Trump replaced the failed policy of never-ending war, regime change and nation-building with a bold vision to pursue peace through strength. He fully rebuilt American military might, modernized our nuclear arsenal, and launched the Space Force. **He obliterated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate**, killed its founder and leader Abu-Bakar Al Baghdadi, and eliminated the world's number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. President Trump kept America out of new wars and brought thousands of brave troops home from Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and many other countries. Joe Biden has undermined our military readiness and surrendered our strength to the Taliban. President Trump will defend America against all threats, protect America against all dangers, and keep America out of unnecessary foreign wars. He will also get Biden’s radical left ideology out of our military and rehire every patriot who was unjustly fired. To protect our people from the threat of nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles, President Trump will also build a state-of-the-art next-generation missile defense shield.

In this section, Trump seems to be advocating for a greater US presence abroad, in particular characterizing Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan as a sign of weakness and “surrendering our strength to the Taliban”, while also advocating for staying out of foreign wars. I find that to be inherently self contradictory. Also, his statement about destroying ISIS is objectively incorrect. ISIS still exists, and two of its international affiliates—IS-WAP and IS-KP—are concerning in the actions they have taken, with IS-WAP being the single biggest source of unrest and bloodshed in the Sahel, while IS-KP is not inconsiderable, as shown by their actions in Afghanistan and recent attack on a Russian concert hall, which killed over a hundred people. In short, Trump’s claim about ISIS is a blatant lie.

>***Reject Globalism and Embrace Patriotism***  
>  
>President Donald J. Trump forged international cooperation among strong, sovereign, and independent nations to create a future of peace, prosperity, and promise for the world. He combatted Radical Islamic terrorism, withdrew from the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, and suspended travel and refugee resettlement from the world’s most dangerous regions. **He recognized Israel's true capital and moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem and acknowledged Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights**. As a result of his bold diplomacy and principled realism, President Trump brokered four Middle East peace deals, collectively called the Abraham Accords, and our NATO allies agreed to pay $400 billion more in defense spending. Joe Biden’s humiliating defeat in Afghanistan has emboldened rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran that were in retreat. Under President Trump, we will restore our standing in the world and American leadership abroad.

The title of this section speaks for itself. I shouldn’t need to elaborate on why this is bad, since this sub is staunchly pro-globalist and generally understands why globalism is good. That section about Israel is the most worrying part of this section, especially in light of Israel’s conduct in their ongoing war in the Gaza Strip. The remark about “Israel’s true capital” shows that Trump has little to no respect for the UN’s attempts to establish peace in the region, suggesting that he intends to generally disregard international consensus (such as it is) on this issue. The remark about “Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights” makes it clear once again that Trump supports Israeli expansion and settlements, a position both illegal and immoral.

OK, but this completely disregards just how closely UNRWA worked with Hamas over the last 20 years. 


> Before this conflict it was not within the remit of the UNRWA to manage the security situation of the region and they wouldn’t have specialists looking on this topic. 


Some of these tunnels were literally drawing power from the UNRWA headquarters. ""The military claimed that the headquarters supplied the tunnels with electricity."" 


> Apparently Israel missed a lot of the tunneling so why would a non security agency be specifically looking for these signs.


Because Israel was not managing Gaza during this period, and had no actual oversight of Gaza during this period, except for its borders.


The UNRWA should at least be responsible for what is happening in their own headquarters, and failure to notice this is either collaboration with Hamas, or complete incompetence from the UNRWA.

This will bring the front line in direct contact with unstable Syria and its porus militarized border. Lebonon today vs 1982 is weak and crippled, its people are poor and desperate.

This could potentially draw Turkey into a military conflict, probably to a limited extent. Turkey has been fence sitting in the past, but current events can change that. There is even the possibility of Cyprus flairing up again further overextending Western military aide. 

There is the possibility of Ethiopia pursing a larger war against Eritrea, dragging itself into the Sudan conflict. This could leave Egypt in a position where it will need to pick a side which to my knowledge is a coin flip, they are concerned with their own interests, like the Saudis. 

Both Egypt and Saudi Arabia have been chasing mega projects that demand large investment and freetrade. With a collapsing freedom of movement they will destabilize. The Houthi attacks are digging their grave interupting this.

I think there is a possibility of Iran courting Qatar for a economic embargo against the West. Angola withdrawing from Opec shows a lot of internal discord. This could also trigger Venezuela into action. 
Iran could overtley puruse its intetests in an unstable Iraq sweeping up militants to its cause in an AntiIsreali Alliance. 

The Sahel states would further spill into violence, with larger scale operations especially against Nigeria pressuring Oil states across the world. Even though tbe US has ramped up its oil production it still consumes more than it produces leaving it and the EU vulnerable.

India will continue to take advantage of the chaos breaking from the West more and more into its ugly alliance of convienence with Russia.

Neoliberal,post,Israeli,1ctscwi,John3262005,"Seeking Access to Congo’s Metals, White House Aims to Ease Sanctions","Three years after Biden administration officials tightened sanctions on a billionaire Israeli mining executive for corrupt business practices in the Democratic Republic of Congo, they have reversed themselves and are offering the executive a deal they hope will bolster the supply of a metal vital to electric vehicles.

The plan would allow the executive, Dan Gertler, to sell off his remaining stakes in three giant copper and cobalt mining operations in Congo.

Those in the Biden administration pushing for the settlement deal see it as a solution to a competitive disadvantage for the United States, one that could only grow as automotive manufacturers continue to expand their production of electric vehicles.

I believe zionism was wrong and the original sin. And both sides behaved poorly prior to 1948. Probably not equally poorly, but I am not educated enough on the issue to adjudicate that. 

But it seems to me that post-1948, the Palestinians became weaponized by external and internal forces in a way that is hard to comprehend in the West. Increasingly, it seemed like their offer to Israel was basically 'You are intruders in our home. Leave, submit to Muslim rule again, or die.' Right or wrong in the beginning, what options have the Jews really had since then assuming just packing up and saying 'We were wrong. We took your land. We are going to give it all back.' have the Israelis had? 

I dunno. Maybe I am missing something. Why have the Palestinians always rejected the peace deals? Do they really think they can just wait the Jews out and one day turn back the clock?",2023-11-04T00:22:17+00:00,t1_k7odqn0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
