'Taxation of theft' is just a statement that 'I am forced to pay taxes.'

Okay, and?

Therefore what?

There is no sense in arguing 'taxation is theft' in a vaccuum, it is absurd.  Instead ask the 'so what' and have them explain why we should therefore eliminate liberalism and all other forms of 'non consensual contracts' and their solution where they somehow pay for every foot of road they drive on via an app or something.

You don't address the argument on a standalone basis but in its greater context.

I am forced to live in a world where there are other people, I did not consent to it.  I posit that this is unfair to me. Who are you to say that it isn't unfair when I feel it is unfair as I did not consent to this.

1. One is a middle man problem and a lawyer problem. Doctors take an oath to treat the sick but access to doctors is blocked by corporations that are in business to make a profit. The solution to your problem is a better kind of doctor. A doctor 2.0 that will banish the middle man and deal with you directly. I outline how doctor 2.0 would work at the end of this post.

2. You have a lawyer problem. Doctors are hesitant to provide risky care because lawyers are waiting in the shadows looking for any bogus reason to sue. What you need to protect you is tort reform that finally creates a loser pays system in the US. You also need capped damages for malpractice claims. The key to winning this victory is a again doctor 2.0. Doctors by oath should not turn away a patient but doctor 2.0 will charge every lawyer and elected official the same amount as his malpractice insurance premiums until the tort reform is passed. More about doctor 2.0 at the end

3. Your medications are so expensive largely because of the FDA and the patent structure. These are government problems and not medical problems. The FDA should be abolished and replaced by private organizations who compete. This will lower the cost of approval and the time to market which will lower the cost of drugs. Voters and the servants they elect will have to make this change.

Medical patents should be restructured to allow competitors to buy in to the process from the start. If pfizer discovers viagra then any competitor may pay pfizer a buy in fee that is based on cost of development and a share of the profits generated. This is again a voter change.



Doctor 2.0
 
We need to pay doctors and hospitals first instead of last. Private citizens pay private insurance companies 2.5 trillion dollars a year for access to doctors and hospitals. Instead of paying doctors and hospitals by visit and by procedure pay them the money that goes to insurance companies each month in exchange for a commitment from doctors and hospitals to take care of all of our healthcare needs.
 
Here is how it would work. You pay your primary doctor each month who then contracts with a range of specialists and a hospital or two in your area. Your market choice becomes any primary care practice in your area. Your doctor is a part of a national reciprocation network that covers you when you travel and part of the money you pay your doctor goes into a national catastrophic fund for those rare illnesses that require travel and extended care. Prices would come down through competition. The hundreds of millions taken out in insurance company operations and profit could go to lower the price. Hospitals would be fully funded without having to admit a single patient so charging $80 for a box of tissues would end. Doctors would earn more money than investment bankers so the Doctors shortage would be over in a few years. The primary care doctor would be the center of the medical universe and he is already paid before you get sick so no unnecessary procedures or follow up visits. There would many alternatives like webcam diagnosis and phone call follow-ups that would be great for patients. How much illness is spread because Doctors cannot be paid unless sick people all gather and wait in the same room?
 
If we combine this change with strong malpractice tort reform then doctors will be able to reach out and be much more charitable. They will already be paid well so if we can limit the risk of giving care then doctors who are inclined to do so can give reduced rates or even free care for those who cannot afford their regular rates. In the US, the crux of the problem is charging by the visit or by the procedure. It is the wrong incentive. Doctors are paid more when the patient is sick. If you pay the doctor when you are healthy like you do the health insurance companies then the financial incentive to the doctor is to have you healthy and at home and not visiting or having a procedure.
 
A single person pays an average of $6,000 dollars a year for health care coverage. If that person is healthy he will see the doctor an average of three visits per year. Assume the average visit pays the doctor's practice $300. That is $900 dollars out of $6000 that goes to the doctor. Now suppose the entire $6,000 goes to the doctor. He uses half of that money to contract with a range of specialists practices and a hospital so that all of your local health needs are met. He also uses a bit of that half to add you to a reciprocation network so that you are fully covered when you travel. He also contributes a bit into a national catastrophic care fund that handles rare expensive cases that involve traveling to a specialist and experimental treatments etc. The doctor's practice now has $3000 guaranteed dollars from you instead of a speculative $900. That is more than three times what the doctor could eek out charging by visit. Everything but consumables is paid for. All salaries, the building, all the testing equipment is all paid in full before you arrive. The doctor is competing with the dozens of other practices in your community. The specialists and the hospitals are competing to be in the doctors networks. There is a lot of room for lower prices in this model. There is no compulsion to go back to the petrie dish waiting room for a follow up. much more cost effective for the doctor to call or skype. Internet medicine would no longer be stifled by insurance company or government rules. The internist or GP doctor would be the center of the medical universe as it should be.

Notice that this solution does not mention government. This plan would only require a consensus of courageous doctors to implement. The national average payout for medicare is more than $6000 a year. Government could pay the primary doctor on your behalf but the relationship and decisions would be between you and the doctor only.

The goal used to be to be able to simultaneously win on both fronts, but during the 90's with the Cold War over it was changed to being able to win on one front and hold back the enemy on the second one until fighting was done on the first front

Campaign finance is obvious. To address the other issues (healthcare, college affordability, moving to a renewable energy source, etc), we need representatives who work for the people. The current representatives largely work for rich billionaires, meaning that they're less incentivized to address the issues that matter to the constituency. If we don't address the issue of campaign finance, even our net neutrality could be at risk.

Media coverage is a product of the failing campaign finance system. The corporations that bribe political candidates also own media networks. Wonder why CNN is covering Hillary R. Clinton so much? Of course, Time Warner owns CNN and funds Hillary Clinton. This is the crux of why I believe that Jill E. Stein is a better candidate than Gary E. Johnson. The rich capitalist industrialists are more willing to broadcast Johnson, who protects their interests, than Stein, who protects your interests.

Conservatives,post,taxed,12xt5ja,SmrtConsumer9111,Penalize Responsible Buyers who have good credit??? WTH," As a conservative, I believe in limited government and personal responsibility. That's why I find President Biden's new mortgage policy troubling, which requires those with good credit to pay an additional $40 per month. While the policy's goal is to help struggling homeowners, it's not the government's place to force responsible borrowers to subsidize those who aren't.

First of all, let's be clear about what this policy means. The Biden administration is proposing to create a $10 billion Homeowner Assistance Fund to help struggling homeowners catch up on missed mortgage payments, taxes, and insurance. To fund the program, the administration wants to impose a new fee on borrowers with good credit. The fee is expected to raise about $500 million per year, which will be used to support the program.

On the surface, this policy may seem like a good idea. After all, many homeowners have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and this program aims to help them avoid foreclosure. However, I believe that the policy is fundamentally flawed and goes against conservative principles.

First and foremost, the government has no business forcing responsible borrowers to pay for the mistakes of others. If someone can afford to pay their mortgage and has good credit, they should not be penalized for the failures of those who don't. It's not fair to ask people who have done the right thing to pay for the mistakes of others.

Secondly, this policy sets a dangerous precedent. If the government can force people to pay an additional fee for their good behavior, what's next? Will they start taxing people who exercise regularly or eat healthy? Will they penalize those who save money or invest wisely? This policy opens the door to all sorts of intrusive government interventions that erode personal freedom and individual responsibility.

Finally, this policy ignores the root cause of the problem. The reason why so many homeowners are struggling to pay their mortgages is that the government shut down the economy in response to the pandemic. Instead of creating new fees and taxes, the government should focus on getting the economy back on track so that people can get back to work and pay their bills.

In conclusion, while the Biden administration's new mortgage policy may sound well-intentioned, it's a misguided approach that goes against conservative principles. Rather than penalizing responsible borrowers for the mistakes of others, the government should focus on creating policies that promote economic growth and personal responsibility. Only then can we truly help those in need and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to achieve the American Dream.

For those of us that are lower-level middle class, but have kept our credit in good standing, we are the ones getting hit. Lets start raising our voice NOW!",2023-04-24T19:18:41+00:00,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
PoliticalDiscussion,post,taxation,xme1z,emperorko,"Liberal Redditors - do you actually support ""social engineering"" or ""vice"" taxes?","Apologies in advance if this rambles a bit.  I'm very strongly conservative when it comes to politics, and far more often than not, I'm adamantly opposed to most forms of taxation.  I do make it a point to discuss opposing viewpoints with people who disagree, but I've always had a very hard time understanding the other side of the aisle when it comes to taxation designed to discourage particular conduct.

For example, over the past few decades, cigarette taxes have risen exponentially in an effort to discourage smoking.  Recently, NYC implemented a plan to increase taxes on soda because people are too damn fat.  Flash back further into the past, and the National Firearms Act implemented a registration tax that - at the time - was very high and punitive to discourage people from buying particular weapons.  Gas taxes frequently increase, partly in an effort to discourage overuse of resources.  Alcohol taxes increase.  Jurisdictions that allow gambling sometimes have higher taxes on gambling winnings than other income.  Etc. Etc. ad nauseam.  

Do liberals *actually* support these initiatives, or is this just something that politicians do without respecting the wishes of their constituencies?  If you do support this type of governance, what happens if/when the tide turns against your opinion?  I hate to employ the slippery slope argument, but this seems to be a prime example of a situation in which it would apply.  

What's the actual limit to the government's power to engineer your behavior?  What happens if someday the government decides that something *you* enjoy is a Bad Thing (TM)?

It's also really hard to make the case (at least to that 87% of households below 175k) that, in order to give *some* of these 13% households a small break in their taxes, we have to also give many times more to those at the top 5% or top 1%.

- Volvo is actually Swedish and is two separate companies - 1 is the car company (the one that you are referencing that went bankrupt and purchased by some Chinese automotive firm) the other is the manufacturer of heavy equipment (trucks, buses, etc) and is still ticking along just fine.

Vattenfall is the Swedish energy company but has operations in other parts of Europe, so not really global.

Statoil is most definitely among the top 20 in oil companies. If you take out the 100% state-owned companies (Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, etc), they would be top 10 and are among the top tier of oil and gas. While they got their start in the North Sea, they now operate around the globe. In terms of respect, they are definitely among the best.

The only economy that benefits from the oil and gas in the North Sea is Norway. Specifically the state-run pension (which owns 1% of global securities - not bad for a country of 5mm) and the Norwegian people are the largest benefactors, rather than Statoil.

If you look back at the pre-Reagan years, we had a low debt and high (70% marginal rates) taxes. Fast forward 40 years of yearly deficits (barring a brief 4 years in the 90s) and we have a higher debt and lower taxes.

How is this possible? Why haven't the deficits from the 80s, 90s, 00s, and 10s come due yet?

To put it simply, government and household debts are very different. A household may have a one mortgage that it pays back on a very specific schedule at one rate, but a government has the equivalent of a million different mortgages issued at different times, with different maturities and different rates. The debt is always being rolled over and being re-financed.

What's been happening over the past 40 years is that our willingness to issue more public debt has been surpassed by the market's demand for it. 

This is because US government bonds play a critical role in the functioning of trading and financial systems in the US and around the world.

Adjusting Dividend income taxes would increase taxes ~$4 Million on the Highest Earners 

A 2021 Tax Policy Center study found that the amount of purchases subject to the sales tax, including general sales taxes and excise taxes like the motor fuel tax, was an average of 39 percent of purchases.

* That revenue from general sales taxes was $411 billion
 * On those purchases that are taxed, State general sales tax rates in 2020 range from 2.9 percent in Colorado to 7.25 percent in California. After Colorado, the next-lowest state general sales tax rate is 4.0 percent in Alabama

The lowest standard rate of VAT throughout the EU is 16%


* In Norway The standard VAT rate is 25% A VAT rate of 15% is levied on the sale of food.

In the Netherlands, the standard VAT rate is 21%.

**Yet American Think Tank Says**

>State policymakers looking to make their tax codes more equitable should consider eliminating the sales taxes families pay on groceries if they haven’t already done so

Thirteen of the 45 states with a sales tax still impose it on groceries. 

-----
So to be more like other countries Tax 97% of purchases at 15% sales tax

So First 411 x 2.5 to include almost all purchases are now charged sales taxes


* $1.03 Trillion in Sales Taxes

Now with the sales tax rate at about 6% on those purchases, 2.5 times that Sales tax revenue to have a better tax rate at 15%

* $2.55 Trillion in Sales Tax revenue

Subtract out the refunds for Previous Sales tax and Property Taxes

* $1.6 Trillion in Funding gives the US Healthcare

Geopolitics,comment,tax,kp66v1v,UndividedIndecision,,"If they succeed in Ukraine, they'll probably either capture Moldova or politically strongarm it into being another puppet state like Belarus, and almost definitely solidify the Caucasus countries. 

As things stand right this second, they know they're hated for their aggression, and as easy as it is to ridicule the stupid decisions made by their military leaders, I think they know that currently a conventional war with NATO would be a complete disaster for them, and a nuclear exchange means they have nothing left to rule over. So they'll likely spend the next few years after that setting the stage for bigger moves.

Something most don't realize is that for as many men as they've stuffed into the meat-grinder, they have huge amounts of untapped manpower. Current mobilizations have been, idk what the right word is, so I'll say half-measures. As I understand it, a lot of the people being sent to the front are volunteers, prisoners, the poor, and the 'dregs' of society, with a lot of your average Russians not being sent as cannon fodder (I'm a little less knowledgeable about this aspect so take it with a grain of salt). Either way, they recognize that a full mobilization right this second would be risky as far as the unrest it would cause. So this ""setting of the stage"" over the next few years would probably consist of working to ramp up their production and logistical capabilities and allowing more military age males to come of age, as well as cultivating favorable conditions with informational warfare internally and externally to further radicalize their own population and soften their potential targets.

Internally, this means:

1. Restricting the flow of information from the outside 

2. Continuing to brainwash their populace into an 'us against the world' mindset by painting their geopolitical enemies as moral and ideological enemies (basically intensifying what they already do by calling everyone a Nazi and claiming that their bloodthirst is ordained by God)

Externally, this means:

1. Using the internet in western nations to sow internal strife and distrust (see all the 'Texan separatists' talking about warm-water ports and posting Russian flags)

2. Meddling in elections to prop up favorable candidates, particularly divisive candidates that espouse isolationist attitudes *COUGH COUGH*

3. Destabilizing collective defense alliances involving Europe by sowing distrust between allies and using the methods above to reduce American support for participation and reduce confidence that collective defense would be honored. Currently, NATO is the big one, but if they're able to effectively remove the threat of American intervention from the equation, they'd probably work on doing the same to weaken the EU's Common Security and Defense policy. If they're successful here, they may try testing the waters by encroaching on the Baltics or something, but I think it's unlikely unless they're able to turn the entire West into a squabbling brawl. Their propaganda is effective, but idk about it being *that* effective.

There are some wild-cards that could delay or expedite further aggression, though, and there's no telling if they'll happen and how they'll affect it (from my own perspective at least. I'm sure there are some people that have valid insight)

1. The US election results. If a candidate is elected that is less concerned with curbing Russian aggression, they might take the window.

2. Even if that candidate is elected, we now have something signed into place to prevent the president from pulling out of NATO. Even so, we can't say for sure that said administration won't just say ""eh, whatever"" and just not honor Article 5 in the event that it's triggered. Again, someone might have better insight on that one than me.

3. Putin's health and age. Some see that he's getting old and think he doesn't have long left in power before he dies or retires. Some think he'll live another 25 years and won't leave until the day he dies, heaven forbid. A despot with little time left is more likely to act in a way we'd think of as irresponsible or dangerous.",2024-02-06T13:01:46+00:00,t3_1ak7qli,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
PoliticalDiscussion,comment,income tax,gqd153j,jbphilly,,">Were you laid off? Yes or No, if yes, then the government will help pay that bill if you show that you were laid off or suffered a loss of income. 

Again, you keep saying this as if we can make a magic wand and it all just kind of *happens.*

But I've already described why in practice it isn't that simple. You just chose to ignore all that because your fantasy of how you'd like this to work crashed into reality.

As soon as you begin testing who is telling the truth and who is lying, you would need a sizeable government workforce to do that job, along the lines of IRS auditors. They would need to be making case by case decisions about *every single person who received this form of assistance.* That's tens of millions of people. That means a huge number of government employees that have to do the job of checking each of their cases to detect the liars.

And then what about when someone's case is unclear, and the government auditors deny their claim, but it later comes to light that the person was absolutely correct and deserved the benefits? You have to spend *even more* time correcting everything and making it right, and you have to potentially deal with lawsuits from people claiming they were denied benefits for discriminatory reasons. So now a bunch of government lawyers have to be paid to deal with this in court.

You could very easily end up with a case where you spend far more money paying all those employees, and settling those lawsuits, than you end up collecting from the fraudsters you detected. **Is that a worthwhile use of government money?** That's one of the fundamental answers I'm trying to pry out of you here.

Again, it's very obvious that what you're really preoccupied with is catching ""thieves"", not with practicalities of implementing a policy. I'm just making the point here that people's knee-jerk obsession with making sure nobody ever gets any benefit they don't deserve is unreasonable and destructive, given all the costs and collateral damage involved in making that happen.",2021-03-09T19:13:50+00:00,t1_gqcyost,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,tax,gmnsr2e,goettahead,,"I don’t think you are asking the right question. MMT as far as I understand it (one book and some YouTube) would argue that it is already the monetary system, we just aren’t recognizing it because it’s too politically risky to talk that in public. In fact, Greenspan himself has acknowledged this very system at a fundamental level (not political role) while testifying in Congress. Many government reps and wonks know about or at least acknowledge it’s existence and possible truth. 

But to answer what I think you are asking which how do you start implementing a new understanding? I think we would start with a national discussion about what areas of the economy have ‘slack’ to invest, are small and not vital to the overall economy and where inflation is less risky early on. To pilot the philosophy in practice.

I would also submit that once the language changes how we describe the system it will do more to fully bring about the new system which itself would be revolutionary but obvious at the same time. We would think about the monetary system differently, not describe it in household terms and use different concepts and language overall. 

We would also need to revise stale economic metrics like The Unemployment Rate and some others to properly measure the true causes and effects of spending and inflation and by function learn how to manage their ‘dance’ better. 

In a way the testing today will dictate how it rolls out but I think it’s coming. It’s really how it works.",2021-02-09T03:46:38+00:00,t3_lfrqxl,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Anyway, I know it's annoying with Sanders in particular because so much hinges on the specifics of his plan and I'm all for seeing more details but (in my opinion) the more radical statements of all the candidates have gone unsupported so he's kind of par for the course there.

PoliticalDiscussion,post,taxation,17m2fj,DistortionMage,Lets examine the reasoning behind some core liberal/left-wing beliefs. ,"I am left-leaning in my sentiments, but I often feel that those of us on the left don't subject our views to enough serious criticism. With the great majority of the right-wing in the US being such intellectual lightweights, its easy to feel secure in our viewpoints. A kind of arrogant, unfounded confidence is the result. Stop congratulating yourselves for being better than conservative Republicans like Palin, Bush, and Limbaugh - that's not much of an accomplishment. In the absence of a worthy opponent, you have to play devil's advocate. Strive for the highest level of intellectual rigor possible (Now I don't claim to represent that level of rigor, but at least I'm trying).

All left viewpoints need to be re-examined from a rational, critical viewpoint. I think a major one is the kind of faith and trust in the goodness and efficiency of government. And there are many sacred cows about government that leftists refuse to question. If you do, you must hate the poor or be a racist or something. Lets question some of these sacred cows. 

Some examples: Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, and safety net programs. Together, these account for 54% of the Federal budget. Liberals defend these to the death against attacks from conservatives who want to privatize or eliminate them. They are just as inflexible and unreasonable as conservatives who refuse to compromise on military spending. Just as conservatives need to rethink their commitment to the military-industrial complex, liberals need to rethink their commitment to the government entitlement complex. Instead of attacking these programs from the right, I want to attack them from the left. 

Now I am far from an expert on Social Security, but to me, it seems like an absurd, misleading, and unnecessarily complicated system. How about we guarantee an income of $2000/month to all retirees who have less than, lets say, $1 million in assets? (well, scaled down benefits gradually to avoid a sharp cutoff). And instead of taxing all workers/employers 15%, make it instead a sharply progressive tax? DO NOT make income above $100k exempt from Social Security tax. Instead, tax at an even higher rate. Tax the average worker at a lower rate. If you are a millionaire, you pay into the system but you do not benefit from it. They can deal with it. Make it more explicitly a form of welfare, and steadfastly defend it. Liberals in the US are constantly playing the defensive against the right. Instead of pretending you don't advocate welfare, implicitly accepting the moral critiques from the right, proudly advocate it. That's what the right does. They are proof that even crazy beliefs can gain widespread acceptance if you actually stand up for them. 

Actually I believe that many problems can be solved by simply redistributing income. There is no need for a massive government apparatus. You can actually have a small, lean government that doesn't do much besides redistribute. Why have a minimum wage? Just redistribute from the rich to guarantee a minimum income for workers. Why have universal health care? Just redistribute from the rich so that the poor can afford private healthcare. Why have food stamps? Just redistribute so that the poor can afford food. 

As for the moral hazard problem, just make these benefits tied to working, kinda like the Earned Income Tax Credit. For each dollar a low-wage worker earns from his job, he will get say, $1 from a rich person. 

Instead of unemployment insurance, the government should organize massive projects that benefit the public, essentially employing any unemployed person who wants to work. They just have to be careful to pay less than what the worker would earn in a real job, so there is an incentive to get a real job. But even if workers stay ""employed"" by the government in this fashion, at least they're doing something useful right? The government can also provide time for these workers to look for real jobs, where they are paid a certain amount for each application sent, for example. 

It's a technical challenge to deal with the moral hazard problem, but I believe it can be done. 

Perhaps though, even redistribution from rich to poor is a sacred cow that needs to be questioned (although it is kind of the foundation of leftist economic beliefs). Redistribution assumes that the rich will stay put and allow their money to be taken. But in an increasingly globalized world, what's to stop them from shuffling around their assets to low-tax countries to avoid taxation? What's to stop them from actually leaving your country and moving to a low-tax country? There is enormous pressure to lower taxes to attract business to your country. A taxation race to the bottom. It seems like you need a global, coordinated effort if you want to pin down the rich long enough to tax them. 

Why, indeed, must there be this reliance on government as the savior, saving us from impoverishment by acting as Robin Hood, stealing from the rich to give to the poor? What if, instead, we coordinated our efforts independent from government and actually helped each other out? Volunteering our time and money to help your fellow human beings? We are becoming increasingly isolated individualists, cut off from any kind of real community or network of support. That's the root of the problem, isn't it, selfish individualism? Why do we need government in order to act selflessly and help out those in need? Just a thought. 

Now, what other liberal/left sacred cows am I leaving out? I'm sure there's quite a few.

Conservatives,post,sales tax,188rz3k,Head_Estate_3944,"Mexican drug cartel operators posed as U.S. officials to target Americans in timeshare scam, Treasury Department says","A Mexican drug cartel was so bold in operating frauds that target elderly Americans that the gang's operators posed as U.S. Treasury Department officials, U.S. authorities said Thursday.

The scam was described by the department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. The agency has been chasing fraudsters using call centers controlled by the Jalisco drug cartel to promote fake offers to buy Americans' timeshare properties. They have scammed at least 600 Americans out of about $40 million, officials said.

But they also began contacting people claiming to be employees of OFAC itself, and offering to free up funds purportedly frozen by the U.S. agency, which combats illicit funds and money laundering.

""At times, perpetrators of timeshare fraud misuse government agency names in attempts to appear legitimate,"" the agency said. ""For example, perpetrators may call victims and claim to represent OFAC, demanding a payment in exchange for the release of funds that the perpetrator claims OFAC has blocked.""

Officials have said the scam focused on Puerto Vallarta, in Jalisco state. In an alert issued in March, the FBI said sellers were contacted via email by scammers who said they had a buyer lined up, but the seller needed to pay taxes or other fees before the deal could go through.

""The sales representatives often use high-pressure sales tactics to add a sense of urgency to the deal,"" the FBI said.

Apparently, once the money was paid, the deals evaporated.

OFAC announced a new round of sanctions Thursday against three Mexican citizens and 13 companies they said are linked to the Jalisco cartel, known by its Spanish initials as the CJNG, which has killed call center workers who try to quit.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said in the statement that ""CJNG uses extreme violence and intimidation to control the timeshare network, which often targets elder U.S. citizens and can defraud victims of their life savings.""

The Jalisco cartel is better known for producing millions of doses of deadly fentanyl and smuggling them into the United States disguised to look like Xanax, Percocet or oxycodone. Such pills cause about 70,000 overdose deaths per year in the United States.

""Treasury remains committed to the Administration's whole-of-government effort, in coordination with our partners in Mexico, to disrupt CJNG's revenue sources and ability to traffic deadly drugs like fentanyl,"" Yellen said.

In June, U.S. and Mexican officials confirmed that as many as eight young Mexican workers were confirmed dead after they apparently tried to quit jobs at a call center operated by the Jalisco cartel.

While the victims' families believed their children worked at a normal call center, the office was in fact run by Jalisco, Mexico's most violent gang.

The Department of Justice has called the Jalisco cartel ""one of the five most dangerous transnational criminal organizations in the world."" The cartel's leader, Nemesio Oseguera, aka ""El Mencho,"" is among the most sought by Mexican and U.S. authorities.",2023-12-02T01:18:33+00:00,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

I learned this during the height of the pandemic when the consensus here was that masks and vaccines were antithetical to libertarianism. As a physician I had to take a step back and realize that individual rights and liberties take a back seat when viruses infect people on a global scale. According to libertarianism, if you as a lib make healthcare decisions that go against what benefits society and you end up dying from it then that fine.

Again, look up your facts. Romney didn't start Bain. He was hired by Bain based on his performance at HLS and HBS. Then, after the company was about to go under, he was made CEO and saved it and all its employees' jobs. Then, because of his success, when they created Bain Capital, they asked him to run it. 

> I think you may have a poor perception of exactly how much money and a good family name buys you at all points in your life. Money matters growing up with access to opportunities, in college and grad school with the economic freedom and connections, and when you're starting a firm that does investment capital, and when you're running for public office.

Can you point to where his father's connections mattered? Did his father buy him the grades at BYU that made him valedictorian? Did his dad buy his stellar grades at HBS and HLS? His dad (who didn't go to college) was not part of the Harvard old boys' network; Romney's own grades got him in. His grades there got him his gig at Bain. His success at Bain got him promoted and, eventually, put in charge of Bain Capital.

Healthcare,post,income tax,2xfhbq,Comp625,"Under Capitalism, will the U.S. *ever* reduce the cost of healthcare?","I think the answer is ""No"" as long as the economic system is driven by capitalism.

* Despite being healthcare providers, Doctors & Hospitals are still businesses. Just like any business, the goal is to maximize profit and make money while ensuring that their income stream can accommodate for staffing, utilities, medical supplies, employee insurance, professional insurance, etc.
* Pharmaceuticals still need to spend millions of dollars on R&D. Lots of drugs are researched but later scrapped. The knowledge is obtained but the dollars are lost.
* Without tort reform, medical providers remain too exposed toward lawsuits. Even if the chance of losing a lawsuit is unlikely, dollars are wasted on hiring lawyers for protection along with the consistent high-cost of professional liability insurance. 
* Insurance premiums and fees continue to increase. The irony is that the ACA laws actually increased premiums and fees (through additional taxes, for instance). Plus, insurance premiums will continue to rise until all of the aforementioned costs are controlled. 
* High-Deductible insurance plans meant to encourage healthcare consumerism backfires since many folks are unable to pay their responsibilities (Deductible & Coinsurance). This has caused medical providers to raise their fees to compensate for the money lost from unpaid dues. 
* The cost of medical devices and supplies continue to increase as technology and material/manufacturing costs increase themselves. 
* American attitudes toward health have improved over the years, but society itself has to adapt to better ways of living. For instance, unhealthy foods remain cheaper than healthier alternatives forcing people to gravitate toward them for cost & convenience.
* Fraud, waste, and intentional gouging are all critical concerns. This is tricky since our society has a tendency of over-testing/over-servicing patients, yet, it's equally problematic to question a doctor's orders.
* Mental Health is a very important aspect of healthcare, but it is another very subjective area of high-cost healthcare. 
* Other aspects of society have indirect but significant impacts on the cost of healthcare. For instance, the cost of education continues to skyrocket forcing less people to pursue a clinical degree in fear of eternal debt.

Even under a single-payor system (""Universal Healthcare""), all of the aforementioned issues remain problematic as high-cost drivers in healthcare. Americans would essentially pay for these problems through the tax code rather than through their paychecks.

That said, as a Democrat, and more broadly as a liberal, I like to hear as many opinions, ideas, and solutions on a problem as possible, even if those ideas happen to come from conservatives.  (God help me, but if Louie Gohmert has an idea that can *actually* help us stop global warming, let's hear him out.)  Thing is that the vast majority of right-wing media is fantasy, drug riddled immigrants reelecting Nancy Pelosi with the power of Satan, that kind of crap, stuff that cannot possibly help us solve real world problems because the problems they're talking about aren't actually real.  
  
Financial papers are a *little bit* better, because they're not based on imaginary stuff.  Now to be fair, you'll still get a lot of really stupid opinions, y'know: 

>""Yes immigrants create a great amount of economic stimulus and contribute to tax revenues and second generation immigrants create more jobs than any other demographic in America, but we should still build a thirty seven foot tall border wall with turret mounted flame throwers armed by rabid alligator mutants.""  
  
But once in a while you'll get somebody saying yeah, maybe a carbon tax isn't the worst idea in the world, and hey, austerity isn't the greatest thing for the American economy, and no, the unemployment level didn't switch back to 97% on the day President Biden was inaugurated, and fact based takes can be useful, if for no other reason than it's good to hear things someone like us might not immediately think of.

While the demand for the product is highly inelastic among *current* users, higher costs can make picking up the habit prohibitive to *potential* users.  Particularly since most people begin smoking when they are young and less financially secure. 

Being well aware of this, tobacco companies likely kept their costs somewhat lower than optimal in the short run, in order to maintain their customer base.  Alternatively, governments were able to exploit this in order to acquire the tax dollars to pay for all the lung cancer smoking has caused, as well as reduce the adoption rate of smoking.

Furthermore, an outright ban would not have netted anywhere close to the tax revenue that marginally increase taxation has. 

Although I have to say, this is an very unique situation where an objectively harmful and addictive substance has been abused for centuries. We needed to find a way to curb its abuse, but at the same time did not want to completely eliminate it.  More on topic with this thread, I do not believe we will see taxes on anything that is subjectively ""bad,"" such as a Catholic president mandating a tax on Mormon bibles.

At a basic level, it seems unfair for me, a healthy individual who drives 5,000 miles a year and has no kids, to have to pay taxes to support, for instance, a truck driver who smokes and has three kids in public school.

However, I feel that paying taxes for these services amounts to a net benefit for society in the long term.  The more healthy and educated our workforce becomes, the more knowledge we create, and our nation (and planet) are benefited accordingly.  

My current dilemma is whether it is a better benefit to society to use our tax dollars to support cutting edge technology and infrastructure such as space exploration and CERN or to bring knowledge to the uneducated masses?  

The former is much more expensive and may take decades to create an appreciable benefit to society (e.g. the internet).  The latter can benefit many people and at a lower cost (e.g. a library); however, there is a progress ceiling in that we cannot teach something we haven't yet discovered.
