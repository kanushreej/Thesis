unitedkingdom,post,warming,3s561d,SweatyBadgers,Top economist says the cost of living would fall by 8% on day one if we left the EU,"> A professor of Applied Economics at Cardiff Business School has blown the lid open on the debate surrounding Britain’s membership of the European Union (EU) by revealing in testimony to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs select committee that the cost of living for those in the United Kingdom would drop by eight per cent “on day one” if Britain leaves the EU.

> The session on the costs and benefits of the UK’s membership of the European Union took place on November 3rd, during which several participants were asked to submit evidence on the subject. Prof. Patrick Minford of Cardiff Business School opened up a new front for anti-EU campaigners by revealing that Britain would actually be more well off as a nation if we left the EU.

> His economic modelling will come as a major blow to pro-EU campaigners who constantly warn that Britain’s economic security is threatened by a Brexit.

> Prof. Minford, who spoke at length about global free trade, said: “What people are saying is that if we leave the EU it is disastrous, because we’ll lose leverage, blah blah blah. But the truth is we’ll move, if we’ve got any sense, to a liberalised economy, fundamentally under free trade.

> “It isn’t in our interest not to have free trade,” he added, before skewering the pro-EU arguments.

> “It pays us to be a global player under free trade. It pays us to sell our goods to other people in the world market and to take their goods at world prices. That will lower our cost of living.

> **“We have actually done a simulation of leaving the EU and the first thing that comes out is an eight per cent drop in the cost of living on day one. Because of the move from EU prices to world prices. Now that is really worth having.”**

> Prof. Minford, who is a world renowned economist, was even educated at the pro-EU London School of Economics, as well as Balliol College at Oxford University.

> His comments have been warmly received from anti-EU campaigners.

> Andy Wigmore of the Leave.EU campaign told Breitbart London: “This is just another illustration of how big business the their lobbyists just don’t get. It blows the myth that we will be worse off out the EU, and it’s about time they started being honest about it.”

>The problem isn't too many humans it's a small percentage and the economic system they built that chases profits at the expense of all else.

I agree that rampant consumerism is also the problem. With half as many people, and nearly clean electricity, they would just mine more bitcoins until the Earth was reduced to ash. To be clear I should have mentioned that all of the green, sustainable and responsible policies should still be pursued. It is not enough to have less people. A change of attitude is needed. My point was that if these policies were adopted, I dont think the current population would be sustainable. Hence why overpopulation makes it uneconomical to pursue these green policies.

ukpolitics,post,warming,r238nf,tyroncs,David Goodhart in 'The Road to Somewhere' on refugees,"Numbers could get far higher. There is the apparent paradox that as
poorer countries get richer they develop a larger middle class, many of
whom are desperate to leave and often have the means to do so. The gulf in
income and stability between rich and poor places will remain for many
decades or even centuries. Professor Dani Rodrik points out that poor
people in rich countries (meaning the bottom 10 per cent) are three times
richer than rich people in poor countries (meaning the top 10 per cent).3
Moreover, as Ivan Krastev observes: ‘The spread of the internet has
made it possible for young Africans and Afghans to see with one click of a
mouse how Europeans live. People no longer compare their lives with those
of their neighbours but with the planet’s most prosperous inhabitants. They
dream not of the future but of other places’.4

There are also unknowable factors relating to future conflicts or the
effects of global warming on poor countries. Africa’s population is
currently a little over 1 billion and it is expected to stabilise at anywhere
between 3 billion and 4.5 billion—if it stabilises at the higher number, or
even higher, it may produce unstoppable pressures to move.
Thanks to its geographical position Britain was partly insulated from the
European refugee crisis of 2015/2016 (though asylum claims rose to over
40,000 in the year to September 2016 making it the sixth highest recipient
in the EU). But British governments have been arguing, rightly, that seeking
to protect someone who may be in danger or in a war zone does not
necessarily require offering them a place to live in Britain or a similar rich
county. Instead Britain has put money, more than £1 billion in the last two
years, into improving refugee camps in the Middle East and elsewhere,
from where small numbers of the most vulnerable can be selected and
brought to Britain.

Rich, liberal, Christian countries like Britain feel a moral obligation to
suffering humanity—both politicians and the general public. But there are
many ways in which those obligations can be fulfilled—through foreign aid
to poor and fragile states, through helping countries to trade their way out
of poverty, through military intervention to restore order, and through
providing either temporary or permanent refuge to people in trouble.
Too much emphasis has been placed on this last method for helping the
desperate: we have the resources and technology to help at a distance. We
can fulfill our moral obligations without disrupting our own societies and
tempting the most able and dynamic people from the poor societies that
desperately need them. And every dollar spent helping someone in a poor
country goes a lot further than it does in London.

For decades the grounds for claiming refuge or asylum have been
steadily widened. The 1951 Geneva Convention, established during the
Cold War as a signal to Soviet dissidents that they would not be returned to
their countries, has been subject to constant legal evolution and it has been
supplemented by the EU’s 2004 Humanitarian Protection directive, and
underpinned by the European Convention on Human Rights. According to
former Labour home secretary, Charles Clarke, there are now ‘hundreds of
millions’ who could legitimately claim permanent protection in Europe.
Such open criteria for seeking asylum could only be feasible in an era when
people were too poor or ignorant or too locked up in prison states like Iraq
or Libya to take advantage of this theoretical generosity.

In 2015 Europe’s bluff was called and about 1.3 million people walked
through Europe’s half-open back door (with some encouragement from
Angela Merkel). In doing so they exposed the promise to give shelter to
refugees not as a foundation stone of European civilisation, as the refugee
lobby claims, but as an embarrassing example of European hypocrisy and
wishful thinking.

We need different rules to reflect our somewhat more mobile times and
to keep numbers to a level that is broadly acceptable to European publics—
that means keeping the offer of permanent refuge to individuals facing state
persecution (as described in the 1951 Convention)—people such as African
opposition leaders, many Ahmadiyya Muslims in Pakistan or NATO
interpreters in Afghanistan—but not extending it to everyone who lives in
an authoritarian state or whose country is experiencing some kind of
conflict.

Britain, and countries like it, should also continue to offer at least time
limited refuge to those caught up in particularly all-consuming natural
disasters or conflicts like Syria. Though even in the Syrian case we should
select the most needy—not allow the most mobile and affluent to select us,
as we do now—and for the rest turn camps into decent, temporary small
towns with schools, clinics and jobs, where people can remain as close as
possible to their homes and prepare to rebuild once peace returns",2021-11-25T18:38:06+00:00,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

All you've done is when you've been confronted with the truth that Corbyn is not like Bernie Sanders, you've performed some frankly impressive mental gymanstics to totally move the goal posts, explain why those goal posts always existed despite no one mentioning them until you brought it up, and then to simply accuse me of changing my answer, when I haven't. 

Corbyn isn't like Sanders for many, many, many reasons. The first person asked if Corbyn was like Sanders, someone replied he was, and that he even had his own smears like Hilary. I said he wasn't like sanders, and subsequently I posted a comment with four of those, and your only response is ""Yeah well Sanders is best known for moving political conversation to the left"" (he isn't).

People like you are why I don't bother putting any effort into pointing out when people were wrong. I can tell pretty much from the first reply whether of not it's going to be worth the time or whether they are going to put their fingers in their ears and shout loudly. Honestly I should never have even bothered replying to you at all, but I guess I hoped I was wrong.

LabourUK,comment,climate change,h76spfn,Minischoles,,"> The last Labour government to do that, is spoken of on here as though it was some shameful past, to the absolute bafflement of the electorate at large.

The last Labour government also introduced the absolutely shameful ATOS assessments for benefits, began the demonisation of those on benefits, pumped the housing market bubble so that it's now impossible for the young to actually afford a house and brought in deregulation that allowed the banks to screw over an entire generation of 'the poorest and most disadvantaged' with stagnant wages.

Lets not even get started on the rabid authoritarianism of New Labour and the shameful actions in pursuit of the 'War on Terror', or things like indefinite detention, ASBOs, etc

Refusing to acknowledge the bad of something is some laughable centrist nonsense - nobody on the left denies that New Labour did good, but they also acknowledge they did a shit load of bad stuff as well - this idea that refusing to see New Labour as some bastion of perfection is what loses elections is just centrist whinging.



> The aim of a Labour government is bring in legislation that impacts the poorest, most disadvantaged, most discriminated against, thereby benefiting society as a whole.

And the current Labour don't offer that - we have a shadow chancellor that wants to be tougher on those on benefits than the Tories, we've got people like Jess Phillips and Rosie Duffield who are STILL unpunished for their rampant transphobia. 

We've got people like Trevor Phillips being re-admitted into the party, and party sources briefing journalists with horrifically islamophobic lines.

We've got rampant GRT racism being displayed with no punishment other than 'don't do it again'.

We've got a party that won't even back the Nurses Union in raising their wages to match inflation and make up for over a decade of pay cuts - that wouldn't back the Teachers Union when they wanted basic safety precautions brought in to stop them catching COVID at school.

Why with all of this, would I vote for a Labour government? At the moment all it would mean is the rosette on the winning party is a different colour.

This idea that it's about ideological purity is nonsense - it's about Labour, being a party for Labour, being a party for people and that means for everyone.

If Labour are to meet this lofty aim of yours of bringing in legislation, then they can start by cleaning their own house and acting like that is what they'll do once they're in power.",2021-07-31T10:22:15+00:00,t1_h76p0wl,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

I fundamentally disagree. The only way that the state can ever hope to be representative in this matter is to distance itself completely from it. Using public funds on Islamic causes comes *explicitly* at the cost of money that could be spent on secular causes, or CofE causes etc, etc. Hence why I later went on to say that your faith should be your own private concern, not that of the state and that this philosophy should go both ways.

Secularism is the only option here which doesn't seek support for any single group that wishes to impose prejudicial rules on others. There is absolutely no reason why you as an individual or individual group cannot facilitate these functions exclusive to your religion via your private worship and support for your own faith without having to burden the general population with financial responsibility for the upkeep of your favoured social group (which I do not mean in a derogatory fashion).

>But most importantly: This isn't a serious way to view or critique theology. I'd argue it's an ignorant one. The greatest of scholars have been debating this since the dawn of civilisation, and continue to. What makes you so confident? You've scoffed at the 14th century - can I read your takedown of its most important thinkers? Historical people weren't, er, stupid - we may be stupid in our ignorance of them, however.

The reason why I'm so confident is the same reason why I said we've advanced beyond the need to placate these people... The difference between the 14th century and today is that we have ready access to the scientific method and reasoned evidence which both disproves pretty much all religions' foundational beliefs and negates the need for any societal function that organised religion served. The scholars of the 14th century were undoubtedly vastly intelligent, certainly far, far moreso than I could ever wish to be... but they weren't dealing with the full facts, and resultantly, in the absence of scientific knowledge which we have ready access to, they were forced to try their best to rationalise reality to the best of their ability, using faulty logic.",2023-10-28T22:51:44+00:00,t1_k6vpxwm,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Clearly, the latter is the faster way to decarbonize. And that's not even taking into account that realistically, nuclear plants are over schedule and over budget.

If that were the case, Germany's 2030 pathway wouldn't be so pitiful. Germany clearly has the funds to spend on such a ""cheap"" and ""fast"" transition.

>Be glad Germany took one for the team and kickstarted the renewable market. Prices of renewables have been dropping tremendously in that time period.

Hahaha, of course, we should all be thankful for Germany, who spews all sorts of pollutants and carcinogens (not to mention radioactive ashes) with their crappy lignite plants.

If renewables are so cheap ""thanks to you"" (of course, countries like China, which are the main producers of renewable in the world, don't deserve any credit), then achieve something better than a pathetic 230gCO2/kWh by 2030. *Then* we'll be thankful.

>The coal sector in Germany has been occupying a powerful position for a long time. Nuclear power in Germany wasn't willing or able to push them away in 5 decades, so really, why blame renewables for not fixing the failure of nuclear power in a single decade?

As a taxpayer, I'd like to see an energy decarbonisation plan that provides the most cost-effective solution, and renewables working alongside grid-scale storage and a small amount of backup gas capacity makes the most economic sense.
