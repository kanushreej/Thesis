LabourUK,comment,Zionist,fzlrgqv,JeffB1517,,"> No one is denying the historic persecution of the Jewish people

To be honest you do several places in this very comment.

>  so we should build them an ethnostate on stolen land.

That was the comment I objected to.  The UK didn't build them a state.  The Jews built themselves a state.

> Why should the work not be done to fix the conditions they are fleeing, 

It could very well have.  Had the British in the 19th century considered antisemitism a serious problem and worked hard to fight it likely there never would have been a mass movement for Zionism.  In 2020 that's not relevant anymore the option isn't open.  Now with a few exceptions they are done fleeing, Israel is their home where they were born.  

> or even integrate them into Palestine without giving them dominion over another group of people.

That was attempted.  The Zionists were amenable to that.  The problem is the natives (Palestinians) were supremacist.  They objected to the immigration and they objected to the immigrants ""disrupting their cultural norms"" which were Ottoman and thus involved Muslim supremacy. They were quite right.  The Zionists intended unlimited immigration and intended to establish equality.  When the Palestinians reacted violently on several attempts the made the Yishuv stronger and then finally  were crushed by the Yishuv.  The British weren't the ones who ""gave them dominion"". 

>  They had absolutely nothing to do with the rise of Hitler,

That's correct.  They weren't the ones who started any of the various European antisemitisms.  They did something do with foreclosing the option of expulsion and so  why the Nazi regime ultimately choose extermination rather than expulsion.  They also  after the holocaust was over and knowing full well what had happened took the position that the Jews in the Displace Persons Camps should freeze to death rather than being allowed to move to Palestine. So let's get to the period of time when the events were relevant.  

Additionally the Palestinians certainly promoted the 1950s wave of antisemitism in Muslim countries which pushed the Mizrahi Jews out.  So if your criteria is ""started"" rather than merely ""facilitated"" there is an example of started. 

> We don't really tolerate this from anyone else in the world.

You must certainly do tolerate it all over the world.  There are governments all over the planet dominated by one of the tribes in the territory.

>  and to say we don't get to question it because the Jews had a rough go is beyond stupid.

Can you name one time everyone has ever said that?  What does get questioned is your right to make up positions Jews don't hold and then mock them for holding them like you just did there.

> Why aren't we creating an ethnostate for the Palestinian people in their homeland and arming them too? 

What do you think has been British policy since the 1930s?  What do you think the two state solution means?  

> Pretending that the Balfour declaration didn't happen, which lent legitimacy and also paved the way for the sale of huge amount of military hardware

The British imposed arms restrictions on the Yishuv. UK policy was literally precisely the opposite of what you are stating here.  

> [The Yishuv] had support and arms flowing from superpowers 

They most certainly did not.  Quite the opposite until the Soviets intervened and Czechoslovakia gave the Yishuv heavy arms.  Prior to that almost all the arms were smuggled or illegally built over British attempts to make sure the Jews couldn't defend themselves.

> Tell me why, today, we should be supporting a theocratic police state that maintains the world's last apartheid?

No one is asking you to support them.  What people are asking you to do is to treat them like any of the other hundred plus tribal regimes whose government you don't like and mostly ignore them.  

You are the one who is seeking to make them an enemy of the UK with (depending on your policy) an explicit goal of: territorial diminishment,  regime change or possibly total population destruction.  And then be shocked that the supporters of the state are outraged by this policy.  Much as you are about Tony Blair having similar feelings about the Ba'ath in Iraq.

How are you supposed to deradicalize people who are massively radicalized and live in a society where authority has currently become oriented around further radicalizing them, without seizing that authority and retooling it to push people towards greater tolerance and reason?

Remember we are dealing with a situation far more radical (in this sense, in terms of how deeply the radicalization goes) than even the Nazis and other fascists were in during WWII and after. It's not like we saw widespread suicide bombings and other acts of protracted insurgency by Germans after WWII, and that was even a situation where the victorious allies ethnically cleansed Germans from many areas like Silesia and Pomerania. 

After all the totalitarianism of the Nazis to establish complete control over society, and the hundreds of thousands of German civilians killed when allies carpet bombed German cities, and the rapes and butchery of the Red Army, and the expulsions of German civilians, the German people... basically accepted that it was necessary to give up and accept a new way of life under the authority of the victorious allies

Because it makes people feel like that they're doing something.  And because they don't agree with your interpretation of what the purpose of the rally is.

>even on this surface level 'spread awareness' vibe, the IDF have killed immeasurably more civilians and children in this conflict, never mind over the decades, 

While I think that Israel *probably* have killed more civilians & children in the conflict, I don't think you can say that it's definitely true.  Hamas have already proven with that hospital story (where they claimed that 500 people had been killed in an Israeli strike on a hospital; it turned out to be a hospital car-park that was hit by a Hamas rocket that went wrong, and it definitely didn't kill anywhere near 500 people) that they simply cannot be trusted to report deaths accurately.  Nor do they distinguish between civilians and terrorist deaths - they just report them *all* as civilian deaths.

But even if Israel have killed more, it's not a fair equivalence, so it's not reasonable to use that as a justification for protesting against Israel rather than Hamas.  Israel strikes result in more deaths because Hamas go out of their way to maximise Palestinian civilian deaths by putting military targets amongst the civilian population, and therefore using Palestinian civilians as human shields.  Simultaneously, Israel does everything that they can to protect their own civilian populations as best as they can, by intercepting as many Hamas rockets as possible with their Iron Dome.

Those discrepancy in death counts is absolutely not reflective of their separate approaches to civilian casualties, and thus should not be used as a moral judgement of their actions.

>so even by this false metric one would expect there to be more protests showing palestinian solidarity than isreali.

There certainly have been more pro-Palestine rallies than pro-Israel; though that's mostly because British Jews are currently incredibly fearful of antisemitic violence right now.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Hamas,kbnsgic,TeddyBongwater,,"Thankfully the ruling elite and the CIA will never let Trump win again. It's why we are seeing him prosecuted on 3 fronts. 


I really hope my conspiracy theory is right. Here are the bullet points:

-The US justice system is controlled by the ruling elite. Remember when the attorney General in Florida was ordered to stop investigating Epstein 20 years ago or when Matt Gaetz legal troubles just went away. Or how politicians and rich CEOs never face justice. It's because the elite control our justice system and their are countless examples. 

-The elite have decided to use the justice system to go after trump. Yes he broke many laws and you could argue they are prosecuting him on 3 fronts because he broke serious laws,  but he had been doing that for decades. Things changed when they realized he had a chance to win in 2024. Why do you think it took so long to prosecute him for jan 6th and Georgia? Its because they were hoping to not have to go this route. 

-They opened a huge can of worms going after an ex president and Trump will retaliate against many of them and put them in prison if elected. This is the number 1 reason he will never win. They will do whatever it takes to get him off the ballot if there is even a 1% chance he could win. 

-Also, the elite know he will end democracy and that is bad for business and takes away their power. America is a country built on money and power. The people winning the game control the rules and they don't want this to change. Trump has zero chance of becoming president again and either won't be alive by the time the election happens, won't be on every swing state ballot he needs, or will drop out from the threats from the elite.

- If the elite don't take care of him. The CIA will. They do not want Trump to hand Ukraine to Russia and then have them attack Poland, Finland and other countries. They don't want him helping all of our enemies again either.

Ireland‚Äôs last 60 years have been absorbed by trying to find and keep justice for a (until recently) oppressed minority (Catholics in Northern Ireland) whilst simultaneously criticising terrorists (the IRA) ostensibly supporting the same aim. 

This isn‚Äôt particularly new: the troubles saw the movement for equality in Northern Ireland fractured between the peaceful SDLP party and the nationalist and pro-violence Sinn F√©in party. 

Likewise in the 1910s, there were differences between Home Rule supporters and the nationalist supporters like the IRB. The former of course were betrayed by the British Army mutiny which implicitly endorsed and encouraged newly formed unionist militias like the UVF. 

So for anyone who grew up in Ireland it‚Äôs pretty easy to comprehend that Hamas doesn‚Äôt represent all Palestinians, and that all Palestinians, and their children, don‚Äôt deserve to be punished for what Hamas did. It‚Äôs also easy to see and empathise with the degree to which people have had, and are still having, their homes taken away from them by an occupier.
