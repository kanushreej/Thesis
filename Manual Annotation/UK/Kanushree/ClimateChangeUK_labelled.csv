LabourUK,comment,climate change,h76spfn,Minischoles,,"> The last Labour government to do that, is spoken of on here as though it was some shameful past, to the absolute bafflement of the electorate at large.

The last Labour government also introduced the absolutely shameful ATOS assessments for benefits, began the demonisation of those on benefits, pumped the housing market bubble so that it's now impossible for the young to actually afford a house and brought in deregulation that allowed the banks to screw over an entire generation of 'the poorest and most disadvantaged' with stagnant wages.

Lets not even get started on the rabid authoritarianism of New Labour and the shameful actions in pursuit of the 'War on Terror', or things like indefinite detention, ASBOs, etc

Refusing to acknowledge the bad of something is some laughable centrist nonsense - nobody on the left denies that New Labour did good, but they also acknowledge they did a shit load of bad stuff as well - this idea that refusing to see New Labour as some bastion of perfection is what loses elections is just centrist whinging.



> The aim of a Labour government is bring in legislation that impacts the poorest, most disadvantaged, most discriminated against, thereby benefiting society as a whole.

And the current Labour don't offer that - we have a shadow chancellor that wants to be tougher on those on benefits than the Tories, we've got people like Jess Phillips and Rosie Duffield who are STILL unpunished for their rampant transphobia. 

We've got people like Trevor Phillips being re-admitted into the party, and party sources briefing journalists with horrifically islamophobic lines.

We've got rampant GRT racism being displayed with no punishment other than 'don't do it again'.

We've got a party that won't even back the Nurses Union in raising their wages to match inflation and make up for over a decade of pay cuts - that wouldn't back the Teachers Union when they wanted basic safety precautions brought in to stop them catching COVID at school.

Why with all of this, would I vote for a Labour government? At the moment all it would mean is the rosette on the winning party is a different colour.

This idea that it's about ideological purity is nonsense - it's about Labour, being a party for Labour, being a party for people and that means for everyone.

If Labour are to meet this lofty aim of yours of bringing in legislation, then they can start by cleaning their own house and acting like that is what they'll do once they're in power.",2021-07-31T10:22:15+00:00,t1_h76p0wl,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Because this isn't a serious forum, and I'm conveying my belief that the state supporting religions should be worthy of contempt because of the ridiculousness of their beliefs and their conviction that their way of life should ultimately dictate mine.

>According to your lifestyle? The state should represent and support more than just secularism in order to be representative. Furthermore, there are benefits to religious faith that just cannot be found in secularism - there is no secular subsitute for some of these things

I fundamentally disagree. The only way that the state can ever hope to be representative in this matter is to distance itself completely from it. Using public funds on Islamic causes comes *explicitly* at the cost of money that could be spent on secular causes, or CofE causes etc, etc. Hence why I later went on to say that your faith should be your own private concern, not that of the state and that this philosophy should go both ways.

Secularism is the only option here which doesn't seek support for any single group that wishes to impose prejudicial rules on others. There is absolutely no reason why you as an individual or individual group cannot facilitate these functions exclusive to your religion via your private worship and support for your own faith without having to burden the general population with financial responsibility for the upkeep of your favoured social group (which I do not mean in a derogatory fashion).

>But most importantly: This isn't a serious way to view or critique theology. I'd argue it's an ignorant one. The greatest of scholars have been debating this since the dawn of civilisation, and continue to. What makes you so confident? You've scoffed at the 14th century - can I read your takedown of its most important thinkers? Historical people weren't, er, stupid - we may be stupid in our ignorance of them, however.

The reason why I'm so confident is the same reason why I said we've advanced beyond the need to placate these people... The difference between the 14th century and today is that we have ready access to the scientific method and reasoned evidence which both disproves pretty much all religions' foundational beliefs and negates the need for any societal function that organised religion served. The scholars of the 14th century were undoubtedly vastly intelligent, certainly far, far moreso than I could ever wish to be... but they weren't dealing with the full facts, and resultantly, in the absence of scientific knowledge which we have ready access to, they were forced to try their best to rationalise reality to the best of their ability, using faulty logic.",2023-10-28T22:51:44+00:00,t1_k6vpxwm,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

If I have a budget of x, I can choose to build one nuclear plant producing y amount of electricity, renewable capacity producing 4y for the same money. Clearly, the latter is the faster way to decarbonize. And that's not even taking into account that realistically, nuclear plants are over schedule and over budget.

If that were the case, Germany's 2030 pathway wouldn't be so pitiful. Germany clearly has the funds to spend on such a ""cheap"" and ""fast"" transition.

>Be glad Germany took one for the team and kickstarted the renewable market. Prices of renewables have been dropping tremendously in that time period.

Hahaha, of course, we should all be thankful for Germany, who spews all sorts of pollutants and carcinogens (not to mention radioactive ashes) with their crappy lignite plants.

If renewables are so cheap ""thanks to you"" (of course, countries like China, which are the main producers of renewable in the world, don't deserve any credit), then achieve something better than a pathetic 230gCO2/kWh by 2030. *Then* we'll be thankful.

>The coal sector in Germany has been occupying a powerful position for a long time. Nuclear power in Germany wasn't willing or able to push them away in 5 decades, so really, why blame renewables for not fixing the failure of nuclear power in a single decade?
