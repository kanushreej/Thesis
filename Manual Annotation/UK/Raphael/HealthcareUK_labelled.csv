I really recommend thoroughly reading the detailed job description and make sure, in your supporting information on Trac, you include each of the criteria and key words used and how your experience demonstrates this (but keep it concise). If you don't have that much experience then highlight transferable skills and emphasise your willingness and enthusiasm to learn and participate in further training. Also make sure you include the specific trust's values wherever you can and look into information about your specific trust.

If you don't hear back from an application after a week, email the specific hiring manager and ask about the progress of your application and how you look forward to discussing why you'd be fit for the role should the opportunity arise. It could also be helpful to reach out to the hiring manager to ask any specific questions about the job beforehand.

For interview preparation, I strongly recommend the YouTube video I linked below as it helps to know what kind of questions to expect for a band 2 role. I've also attached one of the answers to one of my posts and its not the same job but the response was very helpful and they attached some band 3 interview questions.

But also don't be discouraged as there are a lot of people applying for the same role so keep applying. 

I hope this helps and good luck!

Scotland,post,Healthcare,fkesd0,coronacleanthrowaway,Dirty secret of schools; us cleaners aren't allowed to use disinfectant.,"Well, at the school I'm cleaning somewhere in the Glasgow area anyway.  Health and safety bullshit, a kid might lick a desk and get a tummy ache or rub their eye against a towel dispenser, so instead they've to get coronavirus because all they'll allow us to clean the place with is detergent.  

I asked my manager last week about getting us some actual germ-killing disinfectant stuff and he said he'd have to talk to the health and safety people about it, and that the school would have to approve it because of costs, and that we can only use chemicals that have been approved, and that was the last I heard from him about it.

So we're not allowed to follow the [NHS advice](https://hpspubsrepo.blob.core.windows.net/hps-website/nss/2973/documents/1_COVID-19-Guidance-for-non-healthcare-settings.pdf) of cleaning schools with detergent **and** disinfectant.  From talking to the other cleaners, it's the same at other places too, employers trying to follow [COSHH regulations](https://www.hse.gov.uk/coshh/) by only giving cleaners soapy piss-water to clean with, with not a bottle of bleach in sight because it's too dangerous these days.  Although at least one cleaner said at her other job, the manager gave in and got her some bottles of disinfectant to use, because you know, there's a pandemic on.

Now we've been told that there has to be a confirmed case of covid-19 in the school before they'll issue us with 'specialist cleaning supplies', but they're only testing people who're hospitalised with it, so there's not going to be a confirmed case at the school.

ukpolitics,post,Healthcare,18b8pd4,Miserable-Valuable41,On James Cleverly and Immigration,"It always boils my blood when ignorant people say that expats enjoy public funds or anything related.
James Cleverly has now said that only 25% of dependants who came with migrant workers such as care workers are estimated to be in work and that the rest are drawing on public funds rather than helping to grow the economy. These dependants are children and partners who are clearly not in work but also not aided in any way by the government! 
Can I  ask what public funds they are drawing on?
Sometimes I think that these 'people' know the facts and truths but go ahead and spew lies anyway, as long as it fuels the narrative people love to hear.

Firstly, let me start by saying migrant workers are not entitled to pubic funds. Not housing, not childcare and any other public fund you can think of. It literally says that on the passports. 

Secondly, migrant workers pay 'twice' to use the NHS, whether they visit the hospital or not. First, they pay for healthcare, in advance, for the duration of their visa. So for instance, for a 3 year visa, a family of 4 would pay around £600 per year, per person. Children around £450. This is nearly £7,000 minus visa fees.  Exact amounts depend on the category of visa.
Getting to the UK, the main visa holder pays taxes like every other citizen. And if their partner or spouse works, they pay as well. No benefits and no entitlement. They pay rent, have no access to child care except for the 15 hours everyone is entitled to. Even expats such as medical doctors (of which the UK loves to pretend like its only care workers who are imported) struggle financially due to all these high fees.
 So, my question is, does Mr.James not know these? I have asked myself this everytime a public figure has come to make this blunder. 
Wake up and know that Britain is profiting in every regard from immigration! They make hundreds of millions of pounds from healthcare surcharge,  visa fees and school fees of international students which are then used to fund the universities. All the while, the workers are earning an amount barely able to put food on the table after rent and bills are deducted. I cannot speak for asylum seekers, but just halt the lies about migrant workers. You need the people resource and make a killing while at it. Now they are raising healthcare surcharge, preying on the desperation of a global economic problem.",2023-12-05T09:59:49+00:00,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

>The poor people in the south are paying yours.

Hah. Just what I imagined. You, as many other people on the Internet (and on local bars) criticising the Basque financing model (*el cupo*), seem to have no idea of how it actually works or what it entails.

**First**, the Basque Autonomous Community is self-financed, we don't take part in the collective autonomous financing (*financiación autonómica*), which is regulated by the Spanish central government based on the taxes collected by fifteen autonomous communities (as you see, Navarre and Euskadi are **not** included). The provincial governments (here called *diputaciones forales*) collect taxes individually for each province and then the Basque Government uses that money to fund our public services.

This means that we cannot receive ""ludicrous amounts of financing"" because the Spanish central government does not finance us, and that ""poor people in the south"" are **not** paying our healthcare, because we are **not** part of the collective autonomous financing system (nor are we paying theirs, at least not directly). This is different in Catalonia, because Catalonia **is** part of the collective financing.

**Second**, the Basque economic agreement (*concierto económico vasco*) refers to the amount of money WE pay to Spain each year in exchange of the services the Spanish government performs in our territory (airports, some railways, border control, military, etc.). Yes, you read that right, **we pay Spain**, not the other way around. Spanish nationalists have spread the ridiculous idea that we receive tons of money in exchange of nothing. 

**As a tl;dr summary:**

* The Basque Country has the power to collect its own taxes. They don't go to Madrid so they are not part of the collective financing. So, by mere definition, we cannot receive ""ludicrous amounts of financing"".
* The Basque Country pays back each year a set amount of money (1500 million € last year) in exchange for public services.
* The Basque Country **also** contributes to the intra-regional solidarity fund, that helps pay infrastructure and other services in poorer communities.

tories,post,Healthcare,e7e6hq,calculusprime,FRASER NELSON: Sturgeon's disastrous Scottish record is a foretaste of life under Corbyn," 

5 DECEMBER 2019 • 9:30PM

Like Corbyn, Sturgeon’s instinct is to intensify state control - Scotland provides the perfect example of the errors of a centralising tax-and-spend agenda

If Jeremy Corbyn enters 10 Downing Street this time next week, it will  be because Nicola Sturgeon has unlocked the gates. On his own, he stands  almost no chance of winning a majority. But he doesn’t need one, given  that Scottish nationalists stand ready to provide lobby fodder in return  for being granted another independence referendum. The most likely  alternative to a Tory majority is a Sturgeon-Corbyn alliance - and she  would be a radicalising, rather than a moderating, force.

Corbyn  has never had any great love for the United Kingdom, describing himself  as a “socialist, not a unionist.” Sturgeon doesn’t quite say the same,  but happily points out how much in common their parties have. At her  manifesto launch, and in the Scottish leaders’ debate earlier this week,  she paraded her credentials as Corbyn’s partner by counting the ways in  which her party practices what he preaches. Tuition fees? Already  abolished. Private healthcare firms? Kept a safe distance from NHS  Scotland. Taxing the richest more? The SNP are at it already. A  government-run “National Investment Bank”? Here’s one Scotland made  earlier.

She could have added that if English voters want to  glimpse what the future might be like under Corbyn, they should cast  their eyes north. Labour’s central premise – that the country would be  better off with more public spending and more concentrated government  power – has been tried out for a while now. As soon as the Scottish  Parliament was reconvened, its powers were used to reject the liberal,  market-based reforms carried out in England. Twenty years on, we can  compare the two.

We ought to start with schools. When I was  growing up in the Highlands, there was a feeling of immense pride in  what we all regarded as one of the the best education systems in the  world. The PISA international league tables used to agree. But the  latest data, out this week, show that Scotland is falling behind at an  alarming rate - with performance in maths and science at an all-time  low. School funding is far higher: for every £100 spent on English  education, £118 is spent in Scotland. It’s amazing what money can’t buy.

For all Sturgeon’s fiery talk, the real revolutionaries were Tony Blair  and Michael Gove, who allowed England’s state secondaries to apply for  independent status. Most now have. The idea was to pass power from  politicians to teachers. What they have achieved has been amazing.  England is now ranked 14th in the world for reading, up eight places  from three years ago: maths and science are similarly impressive.  Combine this progress with England’s university reforms - tuition fees  allowed a vast expansion of places - and the gap is huge. A bright child  from a disadvantaged areas in England is 63 per cent more likely to go  to university than their Scottish counterpart.

This is what  happens when you put the interests of children above the ideology of  adults. A cross-party success story. But Corbyn loathes the Blairites  more than the Tories, and proposes putting ‘free schools’ and Academies  back under bureaucratic control. And then implementing the sort of  curriculum reform that has inflicted such damage in Scotland. If the  Scottish system were outpacing and outclassing that of England, there  might be a case for tearing things up. As things stand, it is simply an  act of vandalism in the name of ideology.

I met Alan Milburn last  week who, as Labour health secretary, did so much to persuade private  health firms to enter the NHS and make world-class clinical excellence  available to all. He was baffled that his party now talks as if this was  a calamity. Sturgeon claims to have “protected the NHS from creeping  privatisation” but she hasn’t protected Scots from the worst drug death  problem in Europe, or from the chaos that has engulfed a new  super-hospital in Glasgow where children have died from dirty water and  other infections. There is simply no ground for arguing that private  hospitals are, in any way, something patients need to be “protected”  from.

Scots certainly get more money: health spending per head is  almost 10pc higher than in England. But that doesn’t stop Scots being  more likely to languish in A&E for four hours of more, or three  times as likely to die in a non-emergency hospital admission. The SNP  has missed six of its eight NHS waiting time targets, a new Glasgow  hospital is mired in scandal; the Edinburgh Sick Kids hospital was  supposed to open seven years ago.

But like Corbyn, Sturgeon’s  instinct is to centralise and intensify state control. Her contribution  to law and order has been to merge Scotland’s various police forces into  one big ‘Police Scotland, regulated by a watchdog. The head of that  watchdog resigned yesterday, saying the system is “fundamentally  flawed.” But after this and every setback, the SNP’s instinct is to  think of new ways to centralise, to impose bureaucratic control and to  deflect criticism by talking about independence.

If big  government budgets were the solution that Corbyn makes them out to be,  Scotland would have none of these problems: state spending there is  already as high as Labour is promising for England. But the problems  (and public dissatisfaction) keep piling up: a poll yesterday found that  just 7pc of Scots think the NHS has improved in the last five years.  Scotland’s culture, cities, people and landscape make it still one of  the world’s best places to live. But better for those who don’t have to  depend on its public services.

When I was cheering on devolution,  in the early Blair years, my argument was simple: that Scotland’s  ingenious people, once armed with their own parliament, would think of  innovative ways of making the country work better. But the lesson of  devolution is clear: if you have a government that hoards power for  itself, the people will always be held back.

Now and again, it’s  argued that a Corbyn government might not be so damaging because  parliament would moderate his wackier ideas. But Sturgeon would likely  egg him on further - moving faster to hound out private health  providers, doing more to abolish state school autonomy. This is the  problem with ideologically-driven politicians: they tend not to be  deterred by failure. The best idea is not to let them get to power in  the first place.""",2019-12-07T13:16:10+00:00,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

One of the big arguments against independence in the Scottish referendum was that the only way they could guarantee EU membership was remaining part of the UK.

If UK does leave the EU then that undermines one of the core arguments that the independence vote was made on. Which is why the SNP keep taking about a ""material change in circumstances"" in justifying another independence referendum.

I know you're not forced to taper off,  but my consultant has done in the past just to make the change a bit easier. Although, this all said and done - I'd rather not change at all as I don't really tolerate stimulants very well, which is why I have to take my dose split over 2 tablets 3 hours apart, and the other drugs you can have for it don't work at all.

If you're looking for a workaround, with heart health they just test your blood pressure and cholesterol AFAIK. If it's a concern, I'd advise getting a blood pressure monitor (you can get them on Amazon etc.) so you can check regularly. And for cholesterol you can get finger prick blood tests online from places like Medichecks for like £40 IIRC.

If you do get a BP monitor, make sure to be rest before you use it. Like, sit down for 10 minutes, then start it. It's naturally high when you're active, but you want to know the *lowest* your BP goes.

Some form of regular cardio, Omega-3, and red yeast rice supplements (which contains a weak statin used to reduce cholesterol) will help to reduce the risk, in that order preferably.

Psychiatrists, psychologists, the medical community in general, has tried literally everything but affirmative care, until the 2010s when they realised it produced the most effective outcomes, basically when it became a forgone conclusion that you cannot just remove dysphoria from someone without actually providing the treatment they need. 

Also, minors under 16 are not typically receiving surgery, over 16 they have an absolute right to make that choice but few doctors will consider it at that age without years of successful treatment of dysphoria first (it's usually 4-5 years for example before reassignment surgery is even put on the table by a doctor for an adult patient, let alone one whos still a minor).",2024-03-12T19:29:19+00:00,t1_kuk5yjp,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
