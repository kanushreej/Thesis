Department of Public Health, required the state to recognize same-sex marriages.[202] Romney reluctantly backed a state constitutional amendment in February 2004 that would have banned those marriages but still allowed civil unions, viewing it as the only feasible way to comply with the court's ruling.[202] In May 2004 and per the court decision, he instructed town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. But citing a 1913 law that barred out-of-state residents from getting married in Massachusetts if their union would be illegal in their home state, he said no marriage licenses were to be issued to people not planning to move to Massachusetts.[200][203] In June 2005, Romney abandoned his support for the compromise amendment, stating that it confused voters who opposed both same-sex marriage and civil unions.[200] Instead, he endorsed a ballot initiative led by the Coalition for Marriage and Family (an alliance of socially conservative organizations) that would have banned same-sex marriage and made no provisions for civil unions.[200] In 2004 and 2006, he urged the U.S. Senate to vote for the Federal Marriage Amendment.[204][205]""

Climatechange,comment,warming,l2fy0q7,TheIdealHominidae,,"Great comment, this is indeed the most reasonable thing one could say freebytes.

However you have to understand something that nobody understand, that is, there exist a scenario where the main driver of global warming isn't CO2.

If this unidentified agent X is natural and non human controlled we might be f\*cked. However statistically and via paleo data, it most likely is by far that either this is natural climate variability and it will therefore to match paleo data stop/plateau very soon (unlikely) or most likely that this agent X is indeed anthropogenic (human driven).

Climatologists hyperfocus on the greenhouse effect but there are other ways mankind can alter the climate.

By emitting a molecule that makes either:

1. clouds dimmer (less albedo)
2. clouds less stable (half life)
3. clouds less prone to form (accretion)
4. that alter the population of certain types of clouds (some having a net warming effect)
5. One of the most important one: by catalysing or blocking the process of cloud seeding/nucleation AKA the physical process that is necessary for rain. Clouds cannot rain naturally without an anisotropy that is provided by a forein molecule (e.g. a pollutant) in fact we can make cloud rain on demand via e.g. iodine or solid co2.
6. previous ones either altered cloud albedo efficiency or cloud surface or ability to rain,

then there are mechanisms that can alter the ability of water to evaporate.

For example alteration in salinity, but most importantly effects of molecules on plants biology,

fNitrous oxide emissions, water vapor increase, temperature and co2 all independently and synergetically catalyze plant growth.

The effects of a CO2 doubling (end of century) on plants is insane, it increase mitochondria number by 2.8 times, reduce respiration rate by 15% (this effect considerably yet partially capture future emissions (IIRC something like one third), accelerate plant growth by 40% (end world hunger), reduce water need by 50% and reduce plant transpiration rate of water by \~40% (IIRC).

The thing is, this is extremely huge, tropical forests, like the amazonia have 50% of their surrounding atmospheric water vapor that comes from plant evapotranspiration and that is concomitantly one of the most moist zone on earth. Therefore, plant evapotranspiration is a major driver of atmospheric humidity level.

Arguably it logically follows the extremely suprising result but empirically based, that CO2 increase would lead to a drier atmopshere and since water vapor is the biggest greenhouse gas (hence why the sahara is extremely cold at night), it follows that a co2 increase should cool the earth, and much more potently so than its mild greenhouse gas effect.

Strinkingly this is not (yet?) observed, water vapor is increasing (albeit is lowering in amazonia) and temperature too.

One extremely understudied explanation for this basic paradox is the fact that plants have specific symbiotic bacteria on their leaves.

Water vapor level is regulated by the ratio between evaporation rate and nucleation rate (raining) (and temperature), it could be argued hypothetically that those symbiotic bacteria secrete (along with evaporation) molecules that catalyze cloud seeding (something quite easy to do) which would allow bacteria, plants and mammals to thrive by promoting rain.

It could be that the empirically observed major reduction in plant evapotransporation, would also reduce emission of those cloud seeding molecules, if so then the effect could backfire by reducing raining rate and therefore overcompensate for the loss of water vapor, which would lead to an actual increase in water vapor consistent with observation. Those cloud seeding molecules could also independently of raining, alter cloud formation, albedo, etc albeit less likely.

The effect of CO2 of plant evapotranspiration cannot be just ignored, a 40% reduction is insanely huge and is clearly more impactful than the intrinsinc greenhouse effect of CO2, sadly very few climatologists study biology.

Regardless of point 6), there are countless pollutants (including but not only aerosols) that can potently alter point 1 to 5)

So yes as you said, CO2 is likely to have a role (albeit probably for the biological reason) but regardless it is urgent and essential that we understand how we impact anthropogenically points 1 to 6).",2024-05-03T19:29:38+00:00,t1_l2frnnl

That means you have to hire a safety person and buy equipment and prepare plans and SOPs and do safety orientation training, but it absolutely reduces workplace injuries and deaths.

Environmental regulations are another kind because it helps account for *externalities*. It also helps with problems of companies dumping environmental problems on taxpayers while taking all the profits (it’s a real problem with oil and gas wells here as companies go bankrupt before cleaning up old wells), something which most people would find an unfair trade off.

Neoliberal,comment,pollution,ima093b,Paullesq,,"I think neither of us are actually completely correct with this. My description of EPA tier emissions does contain a number of errors. Tier 1 was superseded by tier 2 and so on. Things become complicated because these tiers do not supersede each other at the same time for all applications.  EPA Tier 3 for instance still does actually covers road cars and light trucks. Tier 4F covers non road mobile machinery. The US is not good at writing laws that are both effective AND simple.  


I will admit that it has been 10 years since I worked for a company that built diesels in the US and we did not do on-road diesels. I think since then, European regulations have closed the gap, but there are still significant numbers of older diesels running around.   


While Europe does have a higher population density, it is actually slightly less urbanised that the US.  I think the most important factor is what percentage of the population live in a city where the air pollution tends to be. I do think that US emissions laws really help. And I think what would demonstrate this most is if we were able to see this graph evolve year on year. I think the EU will catch up in a few years older diesels get scrapped.

Geopolitics,comment,climate,hzg99y6,H4xolotl,,"But it shows that despite calling themselves a ""Sinologist"" the author knows less about  China or Chinese culture than the average person found on the street. 

""Phrenology for words"" is a pseudo-intellectual technique authors use to analyse foreign cultures by milking out meaning from observations of foreign language, often while getting all the etymology wrong.

&nbsp;

This technique is so prevalent that [Foreignpolicy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/07/06/chinese-characters-phrenology-orientalism/) wrote an article criticizing it;

>Phrenology for words, like the phrenology of the past, examines the mystic structure of characters and words themselves in an attempt to extract wider political and philosophical meaning. It often smacks of Orientalism, with proponents implicitly positing that the character-based languages of the East operate on some deeper, meta-semantic level that appears inscrutable in contrast to the logic of alphabet-based languages in the West.

Despite being written in 2021, the article addresses Victor H. Mair's argument almost presciently 

>By far the most popular target of Chinese word phrenology is the word for crisis, 危机. There is an entire Wikipedia entry on the Chinese word for crisis, in fact, because dating back to at least John F. Kennedy, Westerners have loved to awe at the fact that the two constituent characters are “danger” plus “opportunity.” 

And the final nail in the coffin for ""Phrenology for words"" type arguments:

They're more efficient, taking heat out of the atmosphere and putting that heat in your home.

Thru compression and expansion of a fluid to absorb heat outside, and release heat inside.  As the planet is heating up this could help lower temperatures too.

As they use electricity, and you can power them from your own solar roof, you get clean energy and year round energy independence with heat and air conditioning.

They 300% more efficient than pure electric resistance heat.

And as they displace one if the worst greenhouse gases, methane, and cut demand for pollution at every step, production of methane( natural gas ) and oil.

Which require, drilling, drilling wells, pipelines, storage tanks and storage tankers, truck transport, shipping, refining, more shipping and final delivery.

All made with steel, most pollution sources themselves: creation of drilling wells, drill bits, pipelines, storage tanks...

Solar, Wind, Battery Storage, and Heat Pumps have all Much Shorter Tails of production to use.

Also, Solar is One-And-Done: Build a solar roof and it runs for 30+ years.

Vs. Constant drilling, refining and delivery of natural gas and oil, every day.

The Difference is at least an order of magnitude.  Pop-Pop!

Price Stability.  Solar,Battery and Heat-Pump are fixed costs that can be amortized easily over their life.  Oil and Natural Gas?  These are collusion markets, always creating ""shortages"", refinery fires, refinery hurricane damage and disruption.  Pricing is highly volatile and unpredictable.  Once installed the Solar/Battery/Heat-pump solution is unaffected by world events.  You're safe.

Also, oil heat, for example requires yearly maintenance of the oil furnace.  Mostly to change the fuel filter, and be sure the burner if running cleanly.  Heat pumps don't have that maintenance.

\-----

Yes, adding to a comment below.

Conservation: When You own a home, start the efficiency upgrade process.

Better more efficient: doors, attic insulation ( double it ), go to triple pane windows, do an energy audit and stop air leakage.  Do a project a year, you can easily cut your fuel cost by 60% in most homes.

If you hit the stock market or are rich: Build a Zero Energy Home.

Efficiency pays off for Decades, for the life of the house.

Efficient homes are must more comfortable, one could say a luxury, vs. a poorly insulated home. 

Insulate your cabin in the woods too:

Do you want to be a fireplace slave?  having to axe cords of wood every year for heat?

Or, do you want an actual vacation property?  Insulate, better windows and doors, and a wood burning stove.  Efficiency pays off in the luxury of spare time, and less labor.

Do you want to hunt and fish, or just have a beer and listen to the birds?  Or do you want to chop wood and freeze in the winter under 6 blankets?",2022-03-29T15:05:12+00:00,t3_tqxu7i

The problem is that you're putting science and facts as the default, and religion as a contradiction to that. If you live a secular life you find yourself unable to empathize with a genuine belief that, at the heart of everything and at the root of our knowledge is something bigger that us that we cannot completely understand, but that nevertheless we trust. So if you hold that as inferior to secularism, science, and fact-based reasoning, wouldn't you expect a religious person to take the exact opposite tack and hold those as inferior to his view?",2014-10-17T04:40:56+00:00,t3_2jgihk

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,temperature,cyfbpfa,NotNowImOnReddit,,"I'm always up for a healthy discussion on political viewpoints. I'll address two things. First, your use of the word ""legitimate"". Secondly, one reason why Sanders continues to be popular.

How are we considering any of the current candidates to be ""legitimate""? What metrics are we using? 

If we're measuring by credentials such as time spent in government, bill proposals sponsored in congress, involvement in government committees and commissions, etc., then yeah... Sanders is a legitimate candidate. More legitimate than Trump, Carson, Fiorina, etc. He has served in political office for 34 years, 24 of those at a national level. He's got the experience of being a congressional leader (more than our last two Presidents have had). As an Independent, he's worked with both Democrats and Republicans, and he's well respected by nearly everyone on Capitol Hill. His home state approval ratings are consistently favorable.

If we're measuring by current polling data, Sanders is beating out Republicans and is gaining ground on Hillary, overall. Is he going to win? I'd be very surprised if he did, but it's a mistake to count him out before Iowa and New Hampshire. His campaign has at least enough legitimacy to make him a contender there. If he can win those two states (polls are showing he does have a chance), then I'd be surprised if we don't see an even bigger surge in popularity for him.

You obviously disagree with his proposed policies, of which there's a lot of pros and cons that could be discussed, but you're using that disagreement to attack his legitimacy. Sorry to say, but that's a weak move. You're comment here, and the wording of your original post, are phrased very similarly to the language one could expect in an attack ad. It only serves to discredit the rest of your arguments. Attack the feasibility of his policies, but not his legitimacy.

Now let's look at Sanders ongoing popularity. 

People don't vote policy. People should vote policy, but people don't vote policy. Sanders touts himself a champion of ""let's focus on the issues"", but that's still not focusing on policy. He is, however, focusing in on a lot of issues that the majority of Americans are actually concerned with in their everyday lives, and he's especially focused on the issues that matter to the age group that you'll find on reddit. Thus, his popularity. **""I'm gonna talk about issues that nobody else is gonna talk about, and then I'm gonna fix 'em!""** *Oooooh. I like him. He talks about issues that nobody else is talking about, and he has a plan to fix them.* It really is that simple.

Half the reason we don't vote policy is because the candidates don't run on policies. They're smart enough to know (especially the Dems right now) that any proposed policy will have to make it through the gerrymandered, corporate owned congress, which is currently a shitshow of inefficiency. Instead, the candidates run on their character, on their record, and on denouncing the character and the record of their opponents. They play the polls, analyze the data, and shift their strategies accordingly. 

The other half is that the corporate owned media isn't going to focus on the nitty-gritty details of proposed policies. That's not good entertainment, thus it's not ""news"". They'd rather turn this into a reality show. It's a popularity contest. It's [American Idol: Presidential Edition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQaO5ZCwryI). 

Campaigns play towards the media, and the media plays towards entertainment. This leads us to a lot of campaign ""promises"" that (while they make for great sound bites) are not completely thought out, and some that will simply be unachievable. 

(As a side note, it's really not surprising that the corporate owned media isn't treating the anti-corporate candidate as ""legitimate"". With something like 67% of the population not trusting mainstream media [Source: heard that mentioned somewhere], it's not surprising that there's a growing popularity for Sanders on the ""anti-media"" internet)

Pick any current candidate and one could find legitimate opposition against their proposed policies. Whichever candidate wins, we could meet back here in 4 years and see what percentage of the winner's campaign promises were fully and completely implemented as promised. We don't even **expect** that number to be 100%. We know that they're not going to do everything they say they're going to do. That's how presidential campaigns work. When they tell you what they ""will"" do, they mean that it's what they'd ""want"" to do. Whether it's feasible or not is something they usually worry about after the election. 

The general populace doesn't think this through, though. They don't think through the feasibility, they latch on to the sound bites and form opinions based entirely on emotional reactions. Simply by discussing the right issues, Sanders appeals to that level of ""baseline thinking"" more so than Hillary, and more so than any Republican candidate with the possible exception of Donald Trump.

**tl;dr** - You may agree or disagree with the feasibility of Sanders' campaign ""promises"", but it's disingenuous to suggest he's not a legitimate candidate. Also, Sander's popularity isn't difficult to dissect if you really think about it.",2015-12-29T20:30:38+00:00,t1_cyf68se

Climatechange,comment,CO2,j8ywk0x,anonymous_divinity,,"> I'm personally not a fan of sequestration because if we have spare renewable energy, then we should simply use that energy directly to offset the combustion of fossil fuels and keep them in the ground.

It seems to me that carbon removal is just an excuse to keep running infrastructure that otherwise will become useless. That's why I think that the only thing that can realistically change CO2 emissions soon is groundbreaking drilling technologies for access to deep geothermal practically anywhere on the planet (Quaise and GA Drilling, microwave and plasma drilling). The possibility of not needing fuel to power existing thermal power plants is too f-ing attractive, and the demand for hydrocarbons would fall just thanks to good ol' human greed/profit motive. Otherwise it seems transition will take much more than 20-30 years, twice more at least.

So, I'm horrified by it, and I'm furious about it, but I'm going to take my best shot at defending it to play Devil's Advocate:

All the agencies are being told to chill because the new administration wants to put its own policies into play - not just about science or protocol or guidelines, but just about tweeting and social media as a whole.

Now, WHY they might do that is also terrifying. Is it because they want to take over all control of social media (IE contact with ""us?"") Is it because they want to approve all tweets? Is it because they want to make social media uniform across all government agencies?

Politics,comment,environment,ijd1qs0,mpa92643,,"So the way it works is, when an amendment comes up for a vote, the ""president"" of the Senate (usually one of the senators) says ""the clerk will call the roll."" The clerk then says each senator's last name in alphabetical order. When they say a senator's name, if the senator is in their designated seat, the senator will yell back ""Aye! or Yea!"" if they support the amendment or ""No! or Nay!"" if they oppose it. The clerk will repeat the senator's name and their vote for the record.

If the Senator is not in their seat, the clerk will announce the Senator's name and immediately move on to the next senator's name. Senators who were not in their seat when their name was called must walk up to the front of the Senate chambers, wait until the clerk acknowledges them, then signal their vote to the clerk, usually by pointing or giving a thumbs up or down (McCain had a famous thumbs down vote that sunk Republicans' attempt to repeal the ACA). The clerk will repeat back their vote for the record.

After going through the full list of senators' names, the clerk will read off the votes they've recorded so far, first by saying the affirmatives (""Senators voting aye: Mr. A, Ms. B, Mrs. C, etc.), then saying the names of senators who voted in the negative the same way. After waiting for more senators to walk up and vote, the clerk may do it again until everyone who is present has voted, then ask if anyone who hasn't voted yet would like to or if anyone wants to change their vote, after which the ""president"" will announce the number of votes for and against, and the ultimate result of the vote (""agreed to,"" ""not agreed to,"" etc.)",2022-08-07T21:34:53+00:00,t1_ijcuhvh
