Republican,post,health care,475l8d,novuadrb43y,Veterans 'Choice' strikes again,"Background:

I have service-connected GI issues.  Since late last year, VA's been sending me out to private GI providers under Choice/HealthNet (HN).  After HN sent my records to the wrong office because they didn't have the correct address/phone number for the doctor, and after I spent a dozen hours on the phone finding out what happened (took 10 hours for them to finally admit there was a problem, then another couple hours to fix it), I got the corrected contact info for the right doctor to them.  How they kept getting the wrong info another 1/2 dozen times after that, I don't know.  This was the least of their incompetence, as the private doctor ordered a procedure in August (to be done within about a week) but due to HN's continual failure to process that paperwork (and after many many hours on the phone with them to get them to do so) they finally authorized the procedure several months later.  I had missed several scheduled procedures by that time (doctor kept scheduling then HN would delay and it would have to be re-scheduled, etc).

---------------------

Current situation:

Now again, this week, with a different private GI provider, HN strikes again.  I pleaded with this private office to understand the kind of organization that they are dealing with, the level of incompetence/mismanagement that HN displays (basically they are like the Comcast of health companies).  Several days later, I talk to the clerk and she admits that everything that I said about the delays in authorizations was accurate, and HN is again failing to process the paperwork (or even communicate with consistent information).  So far, she had to dispute HN's claims that paperwork was improperly filed (she had to send them files again showing that it indeed was done properly), and she said she had to spend over an hour just getting them on the phone to figure out what happened.  She apologized to me for not taking my concerns more seriously about HN last week. So it seems like I will again miss scheduled procedures due to HN.

---------------------

Complication:

When I wrote to my congressman/senator about the problems with HN last time, VA suddenly (within a few weeks) sent me a letter saying that they were taking money out of my disability check for payments made when I left service for my back.  This money was already taken out, and it was not for my back but for my knee.  So I have to fight this, and worry about this new problem in addition to the other issues here.  I'm not sure what else to do.

----------------

Note:

Private care is great, they run completely differently (i.e. faster) than the VA, but this does depend on which private provider it is.  I think there is a serious problem in letting VA run a program that could potentially make itself obsolete (i.e. 'choice' is designed to handle care outside the VA).

As keypuncher pointed out, I could let my politicians know that I think there was something more than coincidence in VA's timing to start taking out money from my disability check.  But, in the last 2 weeks, I'm not with a VSO anymore I'm now with a law firm.  I think I'm supposed to ask them if it's ok that I do that, and also I remember seeing something on the politician's webpages something like 'we cannot intervene in a legal dispute' and I'm not sure my having a disability lawyer means that this is now a legal dispute (I'll just ask the law firm).

----------------

TLDR:

This whole experience with VA Choice program makes me feel like it would be great if they actually let me see the right provider within a reasonable amount of time without me doing their job of getting the paperwork done (maybe if I got their pay instead of them then that might a motivating factor?).  Losing paperwork, sending paperwork to the wrong office, delaying authorizations for care and procedures, making me miss procedures due to delays, having incompetent customer service, these are things that happen on the VA's side (or their appointed contractor's side) of the equation not the patient's side.  Private care works well for me, but the Choice program should be managed by some government entity other than VA, preferably some agency who competes for funding with VA.

I have no doubt that if the compromise was that abortions after viability require delivery or a c-section, every pro choice advocate would be on board, as long as viability is determined by a Dr and not politicians

I think the sticking point there is that the number of 20+ week elective, non medically necessary terminations, even if low in number, is not zero. I have met a number of pro choice advocates who believe abortion until delivery should be unrestricted.

PoliticalDiscussion,post,primary care,29mpuj,tfitch2140,Reddit (Internet) Write In Campaign,"There's something I've been thinking about for a while, and I'd love to get some other opinions on it. Here it goes.

We've got a government here in America that people don't believe in. A system that doesn't really seem to reflect the views of the voters. And, as is always pointed out, it can't be changed but from the inside of the system itself.

So why can't we, the new digital generation, and the generation that believes the least in the system and is least involved in it, start voting for our own people to be inside that system?

Vote for reform. Set up a subreddit, or another forum, with viable write in candidates for various different regions. The goal would be to go around the 2 party system, and break it open. Get rid of primaries, superPACs, heck, even the current model of the House of Representatives to reform it to be a proportional representation system. Organize for elections at the city, state, and national level. Make a big enough splash, with clear enough talking points, that the major parties and players can no longer ignore the American people.

I know that I personally hold socially liberal viewpoints - higher minimum wage, better social safety nets, less money on war and more on education and infrastructure. Progressive taxation, including taxes on capital gains and inheritance above a certain threshold. I'd care for some more input, obviously, and I'd love to hear whether or not this would work and (if it could work) how to go about organizing this to maximize involvement.

>Insurance only muddies the issue. Insurance acts as a barrier between the consumer and the true cost of healthcare. Just try and get your local hospital to tell you how much it would cost to x-ray and put a cast on a broken leg.

Why do we need insurance? If it is a life or death thing like you are talking about does that really change the price if you have coverage on your insurance?

There was no marketplace, but you definitely could go to an insurance agency and ask about buying insurance for just yourself.  It was quite expensive, and if you had a pre-existing condition, you couldn't get it, however.

>What do you think insurance is? Insurance is about pooling risk, not providing a subsidy. 

Health insurance is how people in the US access medical care.  If insurance can't cover chronic conditions over the lifetime of the person, then it is not a way of providing access to health care.  And saying that insurance works if they are allowed to bump up the rates of people who get chronically ill is saying that insurance doesn't work.

You keep telling me that health insurance is like any other insurance market.  But perhaps you're also providing me with an example of how it is different. ",2017-01-09T12:03:54+00:00,t1_dc6oe1d

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Obamacare,dbeh5jk,CaptainStack,,"> We're talking about raising children here. Any thing that steers towards cultural norms of a child having TWO parents instead of one is a social good.

Here's my issue with that though. Two people can get married and still effectively have just one parent raising the children. You don't even have to live together. Conversely, you can have two people who raise children together without being married. So my argument is that marriage is not a sufficient pact to ensure that children grow up in a two-parent household, and being born to unmarried parents doesn't guarantee that you're raised by just one person. I'm just not convinced that marriage is a sufficient proxy for the kind of family structure you're trying to promote, and that if you incentivize it too much then you'd actually weaken that institution. People would be getting married and having children for economic reasons, not because they intend to raise their children one way or the other.",2016-12-19T23:51:19+00:00,t1_dbegzf3

Pre- Amazon, everything was still available everywhere, we are a consumerism to the max culture. That is perceived by many as QOL. Sports stadiums, not sure why that isn’t QOL, people love having high quality venues and on field performances to watch. Same with movies and concerts, again, take the average 25,000 person town, they all have a movie theater with 10+ screens.

Sports wise, its disingenuous to critique “world championships” and to say “how very American of you”, the best hockey, basketball, football and baseball amateur athletics, Olympic sports, all dominated by the U.S.. Formula 1 has races here, La Liga tried to have matches here, and we fully realize that the best soccer is played in Europe, but we have a serviceable national team despite the best athletes all choosing other sports.

We have solved things since the 70s also, you can’t look at modern medicine and infectious disease progress and ignore that it is driven by U.S government spending. Hell, even look at Ukraine and say without U.S. financial support, we’d be looking at a different Europe.

Healthcare, social safety nets, support for the unhoused, all major problems we have chosen to not invest in, and should. It’s just not fair to call the U.S. a shithole with no QOL improvements over other western nations. The average American values stuff and we have more stuff than other nations.

California Today is working through what was Established by Senate Bill 104 the Healthy California for All Commission is charged with developing a plan that includes options for advancing progress toward a health care delivery system in California that provides coverage and access through a unified financing system, including, but not limited to, a single-payer financing system, for all Californians with a final report in Mid 2022.

In Aug 2020 the committee reviewed Funding

 * A 10.1% Payroll Tax would cover current employer/employee premiums if applied to all incomes.  
* Would still leave **some*** patients responsible for Cost Sharing with out of Pocket expenses, up to 4% - 5% of income


-----
In California the Average Employer paid $8,100 per employee for health insurance and the employee paid ~18% of that as a Paycheck Deduction ($1,459)

 * In California the Average Employer per Family Plans paid $20,000 per employee for health insurance and the employee paid ~27% of that as a Paycheck Deduction ($5,400)
* Those number stay the same regardless of Income



Paying | Income is $30,000 | Income is $60,000  | Income is $100,000 | Income is $200,000 | 
---|---|----|----|----
Cost of Private Healthcare |  ~$1,500| ~$1,500| ~$1,500| ~$1,500 | 
Percent of Income | 5% | 2.5% | 1.5% | 0.75%
Under Healthcare for All ~5% Payroll Tax | $1,500 | $3,000 | $5,000 | $10,000
Percent of Income | 5% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 
**Increase in Taxes Paid** | $0 | $1,500 | $3,500 | $8,500
Cost of Family Plan Private Healthcare |  On Medi-cal| ~$5,500| ~$5,500| ~$5,500 | 
Percent of Income | 0% | 9.2% | 5.5% | 2.75%
Under Healthcare for All ~5% Payroll Tax | $1,500 | $3,000 | $5,000 | $10,000
Percent of Income | 5% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 
**Increase/Decrease in Taxes Paid** | $1,500 | $-2,500 | $-500 | $4,500

This is the issue wit the US.  Finding a way so the poor dont pay.  So in the case of California creating a Healthcare Plan, you have a 5% Payroll tax payment instead of 7 or 8 percent.  But you have the low Payroll Tax means you have a lot of costs not funded so to cover you can make Out of Pocket Costs higher, and adjustable.  Then you can have income limits so the poor pay no out of pocket costs

 * There would be No Out of Pocket Costs for households earning up to 138% of the Federal
Poverty Limit (FPL)
* 94% Cost covered for households at 138-399% of FPL
* 85% Cost covered for households earning over 400% of FPL",2022-05-13T01:17:47+00:00,t1_i8dvt8y

An impartial judge has a range of options, she can opt to settle the thing with a fine instead, for example.  But make no mistake about it: she will shoot you if you don't pay it.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Medicaid,d02j7ia,CardinalM1,,"First of all, props on seeking out other opinions and more information.  A lot of people blindly support their candidate without bothering to investigate the other side of things.

Regarding ""free public healthcare"", I think you're confusing multiple concepts together.  Every candidate agrees healthcare costs too much.  Different candidates have different proposals for how to reduce costs.  Sanders proposes both universal healthcare and single payer - which many believe will simply keep costs as they are, but shift the cost burden to tax dollars.  Other candidates have different proposals that are meant to reduce the costs of healthcare - for example, nationalizing regulations to eliminate the high overhead of state-specific regulations, expanding adoption of health savings accounts to encourage people to understand and control their own healthcare costs, and moving to a managed service model vs. a fee-for-service model.  Those concepts are more difficult to understand than ""free healthcare!"" and thus they don't easily appeal to the masses, but they are just as legitimate - perhaps even more so - than Sanders' ""free healthcare"" (i.e. taxpayer-funded healthcare) plan.  If your candidate isn't talking about these concepts, then I'd suggest your candidate is being disingenuous and vastly oversimplifying things to appeal to the masses.  If you personally don't understand these concepts, then I'd suggest researching them to get a better understanding of the overall issue of healthcare costs in the U.S.

Regarding Reagonomics - I don't think any front-running candidates are advocating an economic policy of trickle-down economics (if they are, please correct me!).  However, Sanders' seems to be advocating a concept that *all* corporations and *all* banks and *all* wall street firms are evil and out-of-control, and as a result of that he wants to dramatically increase taxes on those companies.  Other people recognize that companies depend on yearly growth to attract investors and if they're taxed to the point where their profits shrink (or go negative), they will lose capital investments - and thus have to reduce costs by shrinking their business, creating unintended consequences to the economy and workers.  Again, that doesn't fit in a nice campaign slogan like ""wall street is making too much money!"", so the masses are easily mislead.

This is really just the tip of the iceberg.  I strongly encourage you to continue your current line of thinking and questioning everything that you hear in every candidates' stump speeches!",2016-02-16T23:34:02+00:00,t3_4654j1

I'm not saying these numbers are wrong based on my personal experiences, I'm saying they're wrong because the statistics say they are (35k average for 4 years of public university, 11k average for a used car from dealership).  

There are various options available for paying the down payment on a house, and you absolutely don't **have** to wait 5 years to save up the money, nor do you have to pay 20%.  I'm sure it varies as to which options are best, but the point is that there is more than 1 option.  I'm curious why you think taking a personal loan on a down payment is poor financial strategy, but that's going a bit off topic.

Anyways, my main point is that you tried to paint a picture of a recent college graduate who is fucked when it comes to finances, but you actually proved the opposite point: the average college student, based on your numbers, is doing quite well.  And your numbers are of a college student who paid close to 3x the average amount for his degree, had 0 help from his parents, lives alone and drives a 20k car.

The problem is not with having insurers.  The problem lies in the role that insurers play in the American system. 

In the US, insurers use the amounts of their provider payments to compete against each other and build networks.  In effect, it encourages them to pay more.

Insurers should be used to provide administration and prevent fraud, not to set their own pricing policies.  Prices should be set more centrally so that prices are uniform within a given area and there is no incentive or option to build networks.  

Combine that with more internships. standardized paperwork and more services provided by cheaper providers within the system, such as allocating more of the load to pharmacists and nurse practitioners.  The goals should be to get more supply. cheaper forms of supply and more leverage to negotiate prices down.",2023-11-04T19:50:42+00:00,t1_k7tvruf

Most doctors offices charge you the full cost of an appointment if you miss an appointment, only prescribe medication in person due to the laws surrounding it, and won't book an appointment if you have a balance on your account.

So if you're a poor, mentally ill person, and you miss an appointment because you are mentally ill, your medication stops immediately, and you can't get more medication until you pay off your debt + have enough money for the next appointment.

This creates a pretty obvious death spiral where you miss an appointment, lose access to your meds, and then keep missing appointments because you are off your meds, until eventually you realize that you can't afford to be wasting $200 per missed visit and you stop bothering.",2023-09-18T03:31:33+00:00,t1_k12mge6

Conservatives oppose change because it's change.  Right-wing politicians know this makes conservatives easily manipulated.  This is why every story on right-wing media are conservative tales of paranoia and control.

Billionaires don't want to pay your medical bills, and they can afford to pay right-wing media to convince you that you don't want them to - or to pay for anyone else's.  That's their agenda, so that's what you think.

Conservatives couldn't care less about women, children, or babies.   This is why conservatives are consistently against subsidies for neonatal care, daycare, HeadStart, school lunches, welfare, food stamps, preschool, or any other mother/child assistance you can think of.  Conservatives just want everyone in their 'place' - with themselves at the top, dictating how everybody lives their lives, as they will tell you ""God and nature intended"".   This is why guns are now the number one killer of children.

Conservatives want women in their 'place' - which is having no choice getting pregnant and no choice staying pregnant.  Conservatives want trans people in their 'place', which is stuck in their sex assigned at birth.  Conservatives want EVERYBODY in their 'place', which conservatives are only too eager to dictate.  Conservatives are the biggest, whiniest, loudest crybabies on earth - and that's the only babies they care about.

Clearly you don’t want to hear that tho. So maybe someone else who reads this will actually listen. Nobody wants anyone to suffer - but they sure as hell want to rule the world.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,privatized,dexb8uj,Spaghetti-is,,"It would have to focus largely on the war on drugs. Either ending it entirely or at least rescheduling marijuana. It is hardly controversial to say that mass incarceration is largely driven by drug crimes. The fact that drugs only are sold through black markets also actually drives violent crime and property crime by providing a profit motive to organized crime, which is responsible for large proportions of both. 

I think an underrated aspect would also include reconsidering things like civil asset forfeiture and speed traps/ticket quotas; the incentive for police to gain funds through these mechanisms drives some to railroad suspects. Also, it is not uncommon for poor people to be unable to pay tickets which can drive them into debt -> into poverty -> into crime.

Perhaps some sort of automatic record sealing for minor criminals who do not repeat their offense within x number of years would be good, as a criminal record can prevent employment and leave people with no options but to lapse back into criminality.

Finally I think the way our prisons work for those convicted of minor offenses needs to be completely retooled. It is a well documented phenomenon that minor criminals who spend time in prison often come out as major criminals.

Neoliberal,comment,Medicare,jn4m55u,semideclared,,"Medicare currently doesnt negotiate, they use 3rd Party to negotiate, but yes it could be lower of course

>Using the raw data extracted from the 2017 Medicare Part D Spending Dashboard, we saw that Sanofi’s insulin drug, Lantus, had $4.2 billion in Medicare Part D sales. But when we looked at Sanofi’s audited corporate report from the same year, we saw that U.S. sales for Lantus were listed at $2.8 billion, a full $1.37 billion less in revenue. Mind you, the sales listed in the audited corporate report were for all U.S. sales, not just for Medicare Part D.

The vanishing sales represent the negotiations of pharmacy benefit managers (PBM), companies that act as brokers between Medicare and drug manufacturers.

**Lower drug prices** Saves 5.8% of Healthcare Spending

* A RAND study compared U.S. drug prices adjusted for rebates and other discounts to prices
paid in 26 other countries and estimated that an average drug price reduction of 47% would be
achieved if the U.S. were to adopt the average price of these other countries.
* This analysis assumes that an average retail price reduction of 40% is achievable in California if the Unified Financing authority negotiates directly with manufacturers and employs tight use of
formulary
 * Achieving these savings would likely require the state to be willing **to say ‘no’ to certain drug manufacturers in price negotiations, or be willing to exclude particular drugs from a formulary if** a price agreement cannot be reached

-----
Researchers at Prime Therapeutics analyzed drug costs incurred by more than 17 million participants in commercial insurance plans. 

* So-called “super spenders;” are people that accumulate more than $250,000 in drug costs per year.  
 * Elite super-spenders—who accrue at least $750,000 in drug costs per year

In 2016, just under 3,000 people were Super Spenders 

* By the end of 2018, that figure had grown to nearly 5,000. 

In 2016, 256 people were Elite super-spenders 

* By the end of 2018, that figure had grown to 354

Those 5,200 people (0.03% of the Sample Size) Spend about $1.8 Billion on Pharmaceutical Care representing 0.5% of All Spending on Drugs in the US

----
Most of the drugs responsible for the rise in costs treat cancer and orphan conditions, and more treatments are on the horizon—along with gene therapies and other expensive options that target more common conditions, he said. “The number of super-spenders is likely to increase substantially—and indefinitely,” said Dr. Dehnel, who did not participate in the study.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,medicine,c4vn920,keypuncher,,"""US Conservatism"" isn't monolithic.

There are two different conservative scales:  Social Conservatism and Fiscal Conservatism.  Among conservatives, different people fall in different places along those scales, so they're not as monolithic as American politics would have you believe.

Social Conservatives tend to be against gay marriage, unions, large scale social programs, affirmative action programs, environmentalism taken to such extremes that it makes peoples' lives difficult, and progressive tax systems.  They are for ""traditional"" families, deregulation of business, non-intrusive government, strong defense and low taxes.  Many Social Conservatives are also strict Constitutionalists.  Since much of their base identifies as religious (specifically Christian), they also espouse as many of those values that they can without conflicting with their main principles.  Social Conservatives also are big on tradition - though this isn't one of their stated principles per se, it is a common thread among many of their principles and makes it a bit easier to understand where they are coming from.

Fiscal Conservatives are against the government spending more money than it has, un-funded or underfunded government programs, government waste, hiding spending, earmarks and pork in spending bills, and government manipulation of the economy.  They are for balanced budgets, reducing fraud and waste in government, and eliminating unnecessary spending.

While there is some overlap between the two, they are not the same, and an individual's political views are usually determined not only by where on the scale they fall, but also on which they prioritize as being most important.

In the US, Republicans are almost exclusively Social Conservatives.  Some are also Fiscal Conservatives.

Libertarians are almost always Fiscal Conservatives and strict Constitutionalists, but usually otherwise Socially Moderate.

Democrats are almost exclusively Social and Fiscal Liberals.

Where the labels really get confused is where the individual politicians are bought by corporations or lobbyists.",2012-06-03T10:03:32+00:00,t3_uej8c

Lets take 2 examples right next to each other - she did too much in Libya, and too little in Honduras. Of course, Qaddafi's forces were marching towards population centers promising to wipe out the opposition. So inaction may have meant massacres of civilians and rebels. The criticism relies on an assumption that doing nothing in Libya would have resulted in something better than the current mess. I'm not convinced.

Compare that to Honduras. The democratically elected president wanted to hold a public vote on changing the constitution to extend the term limit. The courts said the vote was illegal, but he ignored the court and went ahead. The military led a bloodless coup, dumping him outside the country. Hillary asked him not to return and start a civil war, and convinced the conservative Honduran forces to hold the next election. The alternative is - what? Intervene militarily? Send weapons?

If we credit her with the decisions (and not Obama) she took opposite tactics in 2 different situations and potentially limited the violence in both.

That would save Americans $100,000 in lifetime medical costs and reduce global biomedical R&D spending about 5%. Seems like a good trade to me. And if we wanted to maintain R&D? We could certainly replace the lost $9 billion in research with some of the $440 billion we'd save. 

>On the other hand, we could reduce costs by reducing costly market distortions in ways that reduce barriers of entry and increase the likelihood of competition. 

I mean, **any way** you reduce healthcare spending is going to have an impact on R&D funding.",2020-10-12T00:22:34+00:00,t1_g8jhpkr
