(***WHICH WAS BASED ON A SITUATION IN 2022***)

> Because Starlink is a commercial product rather than a traditional defense contractor, Mr. Musk is able to make decisions that may not be aligned with U.S. interests, analysts have said.

Starlink was not a contractor in 2022.

From the CNN article that the NYT article cites:

> ... by asserting that the Starlink service provided by his company SpaceX was never active over Crimea and that the Ukrainian government made an “emergency request” to him to turn on service.

> “There was an emergency request from government authorities to activate Starlink all the way to Sevastopol,” Musk posted on X, the platform formally known as Twitter that he owns. Sevastopol is a port city in Crimea. “The obvious intent being to sink most of the Russian fleet at anchor. If I had agreed to their request, then SpaceX would be explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation.” 

From a [separate article](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/space-force-contract-spacex-starshield/) -->

> The Space Force’s contract with SpaceX is effective from Sept. 1, 2023, to Sept. 30, 2024, with an option for an additional year. 

Moreover, you'll find that [initially](https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/politics/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-ukraine/index.html), SpaceX had ***donated*** ~$80 million worth of satellites to Ukraine in 2022.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,antisemitic,c667cct,PickledHerrinSharin,,"My Response:

Members of my Family and Friends,

The US political system is currently in the throes of serious realignment.  Watching the two party conventions should make this clear to everyone..both mainstream US parties are dealing with an internal divide roughly along ""moderate"" and ""extreme"" lines.  The US two-party system is a system which by its design, agree with it or not, encourages moderation and discourages extremism.  This effect is caused by two parties fighting over moderate votes, thus forcing alignment to the center.  The effect of such realignment, however, often comes at the cost of periodic revolts by party hardliners on both sides. 

In the United States currently, the progressive left is revolting at the same time as the religious right.  These two parties are the enmity of one another and seek to discredit their opposing ""wing"" as it were in any way possible.  Thus, the DNC vote to reinstate references to God and the sanctity of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was very divisive in the Democratic party.  The progressive left will never vote for any religiously-charged statement because that is the primary platform of the enemy -- the religious right.  The subject of Israel is itself very divisive in both parties, and not just among the wings but among the party mainstream.  Foolishly, these two pieces of subject-matter were proposed in a single vote...so of course every progressive democrat would not vote for it on the basis of the ""God"" issue, and half of the party is divided on Israel anyway (as is about half of the Republican party...libertarians want NO external-foreign alliance systems).  If these two issues had been separately proposed, I doubt opposition would have been nearly as strong.  I disagree that this is a seminal moment or a telling one; it was a serious error on the part of the Democratic party to propose the vote in the way they did, and a sham, but not a turning-point.

The pendulum of US politics is slowly moving in a direction away from the center in the case of both parties.  This effect will eventually fade due to either party divisions (and the extinction of independent ""wing"" parties) or forced realignment to the center due to consistent failure of the more extreme aligned party to win elections.  This does not mean that damage cannot be done by the pendulum swing, however.  The best we can all do is be vigilant of party extremism and not tolerate extremist views, no matter the side of the aisle they emanate from.  I am no fan of the religious right nor the progressive left, both are short-sighted and seek to compromise personal freedoms for the sake of a hard-line agenda.

The example of France is brought up in the source email for this conversation; look to France for what we do not want to become.  The French system in the French 5th Republic is a four-party system which by its nature grants disproportionate power to the extreme parties..the middle is held hostage by the wings.  In France, the Communist Party and Front Populaire (Popular Front) control the agenda of the right and left respectively, and both parties would seek to seriously disenfranchise the voters of the other.  Do not be held hostage by extreme views: fear and an inability to compromise are our enemies -- reason and moderation are our allies.

No party in this country has upheld its public promises from the last four years, and both parties have purposefully stalled the political process as a way of attempting to discredit the other.  This has made us all weaker as a country, as a society and as a nation and has only made those who seek to inject extremism into the political process stronger.

As for the source message...I see no references besides a broken link.  The French have an often unmentioned and very unfortunate long history of antisemitism in their national culture which continues to this day, especially so when the left-wing is in control -- do not forget Vichy and pre-WWII France.  Muslims face a similar fate under Nationalist French governments -- do not forget Algeria.  I see little else which is verifiable in the initial email message besides sensationalism and encourage a reasonable look at what was said.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,genocide,gfi4r9o,fishybatman,,"Argument 1 for guns: people who plan to commit a shooting will get there hands on a gun regardless of the law. At least if legalised we can control the market and monitor gun sales which will help intelligence.

Argument 2 for guns: people need guns. They may need them defend themselves especially if they live in high crime areas where police services are stretched to thin to guarantee safety. They may also need them to allow the people to rise against the government should it one day stand against the will of the people. 

Arguments 1 against guns: buying guns enables ordinary citizens to easily become murders. Not all shootings are well planed and realistically one can not constantly check up on the mental state of all gun owners to make sure they are not close to snapping. The failure of the current system is demonstrated by the amount of shootings that America has relative to other countries which ban guns (pro gun people claim this is the result of different society’s rather than gun laws eg Japan is culturally homogeneous with said culture promoting more respect for the law.)

Argument 2 against guns:the argument about rebellion incorrectly assumes that America is not a polarised nation. Realistically if a time like this were ever to come we would see civil war between two or more armed sides (which pro gun people may argue to be better than the alternative of submitting to the dictatorship. There are plenty examples of successful armed anti and pro dictator rebellions and coups in past and recent history (right wingers got this idea from the post American and French Revolution line of thinking though))",2020-12-12T08:48:52+00:00,t3_kb2dkv

They keep forcing people to move into smaller and smaller areas, then claim that new area is where all the terrorism is, and tell them to move again. They are already up against the Egyptian border. They have no where else to move.

I think the goal is to get them to all flee across the border. Egypt is not accepting any significant number of refugees, but it is hard to stop hundreds of thousands of people fleeing. So either they go to Egypt and manage to get past the border, die trying to get across the border, or die being bombed for ""not moving."" And Israel is doing everything they can to destabilize the border there, making it increasingly more dangerous.

The only way I can interpret these events is that they are planning on getting rid of as much of the population by any means, but preferably violent ones. It is about as clear of an ethnic cleansing as I can imagine.

Quantum computing may also be disruptive in the same fashion, but has more niche influences & doesn't seem to be a standalone path to hegemony like AGI could be.
There are high profile voices such as Deep Mind CEO Demis Hassabis that predict AGI within a few years. We're getting close.


Current geopolitical scene:

Ukraine - Russia war remains the key issue. We could start seeing the result solidify if it becomes clear US support is untenable & a possible Trump presidency looms ever closer. A commited US might be enough to hold the line but it's hard to see a comprehensive outcome for Ukraine given it will likely never receive the scale and quality of support it needs to force Russia out.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Jews,eu5ct13,ManBearScientist,,"There is only one Republican that has publicly confirmed that they would want to be President in 2024 given that scenario.  And that Republican is Donald Trump himself. 

This is clearly extra-constitutional, but we've been in these situations throughout the Trump Presidency.  The fact of the matter is that Trump would likely be in a position to place a near majority on the Supreme Court with possible retirements of Breyer, RGB, and Roberts and it is impossible to say with certainly how our institutions would react to such a thing.

What does that mean?  I doubt Trump himself knows.  But his statements have again and again shown he fancies the idea.

>In fact, I said in a speech recently, 'Watch, we'll drive the media crazy. Let's go for a third term and then a fourth.' - Donald Trump

At a guess, 'going' for these extra terms will be as simple as saying ""I am running"" with the collective institutions of government and party not being able to do anything about it.  In scenario, the GOP is Trump's party, and no Republican dares step out of line to try and stop him.  The Supreme Court he picks backs him despite the law, the Secret Service is ousted in favor of Trump's private security force.

As an outsider to the Republican party, I see zero internal will to stop this and significant desire for such a thing to happen.  And with the state of our institutions now, I can only imagine their state in 2024 after a Trump trifecta takes hold.  Republicans already control virtually all power in this country, but this would shift the court system and the few other remaining safety valves their way as well.

People may say that is crazy.  I find it crazy that the Senate has stated that they would ignore evidence to avoid indicting Trump, putting him completely and totally above the law.  I find it crazy that Republican's changed the Special Counsel process post-Clinton to prevent recommending charges.  I find it crazy that Republicans openly laugh at breaking the Hatch Act and dare people to try and enforce the law.  We live in crazy times.",2019-07-18T18:33:19+00:00,t3_cdbuw4

We can all bet our money that our Russia helped president is not sleeping at all in the night.
With Twitter as his best friend, Trump is petrified about morning sun peeping through his bedroom window in the White House.

He also wishes that his new found friends in Fox Tv's morning show would wake up early and start their show at 2 AM instead of 7 in the morning so that their insomniac president can get some terrible advice on how to run his administration's foreign policies.

We all know by now that Trump formulates his immigration policies with the help of Sean Hannity and other pundits working in morning show of Fox Tv. 

That dependency on other ignorant advisers including Stephen Miller which dragged his reputation so far down with the majority of Americans that he might be ready to fire Stephen Miller, the main architect of his ill advised Muslim ban and the most degrading family separation policies.

This inhuman family separation policy that even Stephen's Jewish family members including his own uncle condemned after comparing his horrible practice to separate the parents of recent immigrants from their own children to that of Hitler's family separation practices of Jews and other prisoners at his concentration camps before they were gassed to death in '30s Germany.

No wonder now when the ghost of Nixon is making him wake up early from his bed at around maybe little after 12 o'clock in the night, Trump is contemplating to fight back against the apparent comparison of his presidency's end with Nixon.

Let's not even talk of the hundreds of thousands of lives lost in Afghanistan / Iraq over fabricated lies about WMD, or the SEA / Latin American CIA coups which installed brutal dictators instead...

China's approach to minorities is far more enlightened and humane than what most of the Western world has managed, and the proof is in the pudding - of the 55 minority groups in China - constituting less than 10% of their population but occupying 64% of China's land area - only 2 groups (Uighur and Tibetans) have seriously rebelled or sought independence.

All nations find it difficult to maintain control over far flung border regions which are culturally different from the centre of power. The British couldn't do it, and their globe spanning empire fell apart. The Soviet Union couldn't do it. None of the colonial powers could.

China remains largely intact, with 53 minorities largely satisfied, even enthusiastic about their integration with the Han Chinese. 

How does China keep its minority cultures happy? 

Let me introduce you to RAEM - Regional Autonomy for Ethnic Minorities - which has remained one of the three cornerstones of the Chinese Communist Party up until today.

In historical terms, the Communist party gained power BECAUSE they had the support of the minorities - and it allowed them to defeat the Nationalists, who retreated to Taiwan. Hence RAEM is enshrined as a core pillar of policy.

Any area in China where an ethnic minority exceeds 20% of the population, it gets given special rights. This applies to the province (state) level, prefecture and county level. The governor must be from that ethnic minority, and the region gets independence of finance, economic planning, control of local police, and choice of local language in schools and government. They also get increased representation in the legislature, and increased healthcare funding and economic development investment. Basically this is the carrot approach. RAEM regions grew their economies and population faster than the Han majority regions.

This is why the controversial birth restrictions - could only ever be imposed on the Han Chinese majority - because they were afraid of infringing on the special status of the minority groups in China and triggering a rebellion. Contrast this to how Australia or US treated its minority cultures...

China's recent ascendance on the world stage has gained itself the loyal support of the other minorities in the hopes of sharing those economic and political benefits - and so the gloves are off. No need to tip toe around the Uighur and offer them carrots anymore, it's time for the stick.

In any case, from a global perspective, China's handling of the terror attacks in Xinjiang is far preferable to the US response to 9/11 and the wholesale destruction they wrought on Iraq and Afghanistan (but leaving Saudi Arabia untouched even though most of the terrorists were from there?), wouldn't you say?",2021-05-12T13:02:14+00:00,t1_gxsbl4z

Because if the US bothered to lie to the world in 2003 about WMD in Iraq, it's only because the UN still has some use for them.

\------------------

Recent studies have been conducted on a large number of genes, homologous chromosomes or autosomes (all chromosomes except chromosomes X and Y). A 2009 study was able to genetically identify individuals with full or partial Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.\[8\] In August 2012, Dr. Harry Ostrer in his book Legacy: A Genetic History of the Jewish People, summarized his and other work in genetics of the last 20 years, and concluded that all major Jewish groups share a common Middle Eastern origin.\[9\] Ostrer also refuted the Khazar theory of Ashkenazi ancestry.\[10\] Citing autosomal DNA studies, Nicholas Wade estimates that ""Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews have roughly 30 percent European ancestry, with most of the rest from the Middle East."" He further noticed that ""The two communities seem very similar to each other genetically, which is unexpected because they have been separated for so long."" Concerning this relationship he points to Atzmon's conclusions that ""the shared genetic elements suggest that members of any Jewish community are related to one another as closely as are fourth or fifth cousins in a large population, which is about 10 times higher than the relationship between two people chosen at random off the streets of New York City"".\[11\]",2021-05-19T21:42:17+00:00,t1_gyqs2z9

* When the Islamic Republic first released the drones, it almost appeared as if they were purposefully giving Israel fair warning.  However, the way they timed the release of the remaining weaponry, to arrive right behind those drones that left a few openings in the air defense, showed that it was more strategic than for advanced warning.
* A country at war cannot be fully trusted.  If there were \~300 weapons fired and 3 got through, that's 1% failure and 99% success rate.  From the various video clips released by civilians during and after the attack, it appeared that more like 12-13 ballistic warheads passed through air defense.
* If the Islamic Republic legitimately plans to rid the Middle East of Israel one day with nuclear warheads, they really wouldn't have to get that many of them past Israel's air defense to do so.  Israel's tiny, and the same ballistic missiles that they used during the attack, can be refitted for nuclear warheads.  The Islamic Republic will study their attack, identify every weakness and hole, and they will learn a great deal from it, that they were nowhere near learning before.
* Reportedly, the USAF alone took down over 25% of the weapons the Islamic Republic used in the attack.  Reportedly, the UK, France, Jordan, and Saudi also played various roles in Israel's air defense during the attack.  This cannot necessarily be counted on for future attacks, and could lead to additional vulnerabilities in the future.",2024-04-16T07:31:26+00:00,t3_1c59n2k

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Israel,l0p24yz,A_Coup_d_etat,,"The reason that the current GOP is in their situation is because they spent 25+ years (mid-80's to \~2010) fucking over their voting base to serve their true masters, the wealthy and powerful; After Reagan took over the party they shifted from the party of ""small government"", which favors the wealthy (because they only really need the government to maintain order) but still does things for the average American, to a party whose entire domestic policy is to put more wealth and power into the hands of those who are already wealthy and powerful, primarily through tax cuts and weakening government regulation.

The problem the GOP has is that their policies only benefit the top 1% wealthiest, with maybe the top 10% being wealthy adjacent enough to have some benefit and some kind of chance of joining the top 1%. However you cannot win elections to get into power to achieve those goals with only 15-20% (factoring the people who don't vote) of the vote.

Which is why they engage in the culture wars. They largely don't really care about them, they just need those voters to win elections. The Single-Issue (abortion and guns) voters are no real problem because neither of those issues affect the rich. For decades they kept the general purpose Culture Warrior types on board by demagoguing on issues like immigration via talk radio and Fox without actually doing anything about it. Because the rich love immigration as it grows the economy and provides cheap labor.  Their voting base however hates immigration.

About 15 years ago the voting base woke up and realized they had been getting played and so they started taking out the GOP establishment through the primaries. So the current GOP is a mixture of establishment types who really just want to cut taxes for the rich and piss away taxpayer money on foreign adventures and maintain the status quo and the ones elected by the activists who want to roll back 40 years of immigration immediately.

There is no real room for compromise between the two sides it's just a matter of whether the activist voters are willing to abandon the party.",2024-04-22T03:59:57+00:00,t1_l0ny3ao

Politics,comment,IDF,c0r7hpo,recreational,,"The argument is that the ships in question were threatening to invade what is still legally Israeli territory. Therefore, Israel didn't actually have to wait for the ships to invade its territory to act in self-defense.

Think of it this way; if someone is standing on the sidewalk in front of your house, pacing back and forth and threatening to charge in, and you have reason to fear for your safety or, say, that of your kids, you have the right to subdue that person.

So there's a valid legal argument in favor of Israel's right to board those ships.

The trouble is that there's no legal standard that I know of that justifies using violent force in such a situation. You are allowed to use self-defense to *subdue* in many situations in which you are not allowed to use it to *kill*. You have to have, essentially, a reasonable fear for your or someone else's life *and* a reasonable suspicion that other methods of self-defense are inadequate for the situation in order to justify such a response.

Israel's going to have trouble doing that. The ideal situation from Israel's point of view is it's somehow proven that the ships were firing at Israel. But a response where ten people were killed and half the people on board seem to have been injured seems difficult to justify as merely self-defense against guys with sticks and kitchen knives. You can over-step your right to self-defense pretty easily; if someone is no longer a threat and you continue to attack them, you're no longer covered.

Now Israel clearly didn't order this actual attack. It's not in their interests, and the fact that it only happened in the raid on one of six ships says pretty clearly to me that someone got nervous and started shooting. But Israel (and now America, unfortunately) is acting to cover it up. This is particularly fucked up since Turkey is a member of NATO and thus we are obliged to aid them in this situation; their nationals have been attacked in Europe. Expect them to invoke the charter in the near future. And it's almost a lock that every other member of the treaty except for us will back them.

This is a bad situation all around. Turkey alone is actually way more important than Israel strategically, but it's not just going to be Turkey. We could lose the entire EU over this. On the plus side, this may actually be the catalyst that finally pushes Turkey into the EU. Europe's response has been far better than America's in this crisis, and the loss of peaceful protesters is bound to elicit sympathy.",2010-06-01T21:26:37+00:00,t3_ca42u

No question. But their actions have been consistent with not wanting to escalate. 

Maybe that changes if this conflict is still ongoing in a year, somehow. Maybe Iran reaches its tipping point. Maybe America has a political swing towards fascism despite what recent electoral trends suggest. Maybe Israel decides it needs a first strike on Iran. Fine; the thesis for this chain was that Iranian and American interests align on this issue *right now*. Not ten years ago, not five years from now. Right now. And the evidence supports that.
