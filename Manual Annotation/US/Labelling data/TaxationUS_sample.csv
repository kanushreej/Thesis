The themes echoed was
1. Bailout of Wall St by Tax payers money caused the Occupy Wall St and Tea party populist movements.
2. Trump, Palin, Bernie & Obama was a reaction against the establishment and latter became a part of it soon enough.
3. Affordable Care Act was a blow that GOP could never forget.
4. Trump even though was an elite, he gave voice to forgotten men and women.
5. Both establishment RNC and DNC have become a party of elites pretending to be a party of the middle class - so another populist candidate always has a room to run the show.

In my limited understanding, I neither completely agree or disagree with the statements except for ACA.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,social security,jgrifja,tracertong3229,,">Does DeSantis have a shot against Trump? If not, did he ever? If yes, what's his path to the nomination?

Desantis' biggest strength is the potential likelihood of Trump being convicted of something in the next year. I find this a Longshot at best given Trump's wealth and power, but if it does happen then Desantis will likely be the next best thing, and I think he understands this.

>DeSantis still the only viable alternative?

I think he's the highest profile Republican who already hasn't run already, which is an interesting problem that's caused by the large primary fields of the last few cycles, where lots of people threw their hat in the ring, and as a result are now tainted by their previous failures. In another timeline its possible that if someone like Ted Cruz hadn't run already and lost, he could run now and do better than he did in our history. However we don't live in that time and this is what the GOP is left with.

>Do the Disney feud and the Heartbeat Bill help him or hurt him in the primary?

It will depend how/if Disney views Desantis as enough of a nuisance to really throw their money around to try and hurt him. Corporations can be spiteful, and they are incredibly powerful but I'm not in  the Disney boardrooms and I don't know if they're really willing to act as aggressively against him as they theoretically could.

As for the Heartbeat Bill, it's unlikely to help in the primary or the general in my opinion. The GOP can't moderate on abortion, the problem with that though is that it makes it more difficult to differentiate any republican when they ALL oppose abortion in someway, it's expected and you don't really get credit fir what you're already expected to do. So it's unlikely to help in the primary, and in the general too much of the population opposes anti abortion laws for it to be a serious asset.


>Will we see any significant swings in polling if/when DeSantis officially announces and starts campaigning?

In video games production there's a concept called early access that allows people to buy and play games as they are being made, this comes with advantages for studios who can get money from customers earlier and put more money into the production. One of the big drawbacks of this idea though, is that it detracts from tgh attention and profits the studio would ordinarilly receive when the game is officially released. In the consumer's eye, there's only really one release and tgats the earliest one. If the game is unpopular when it hits early access that reputation usually defines the game in the public consciousness forever, regardless of how the game is when its officially complete. By  dragging out his announcement so long desantis will likely face similar problems, where he's likely already passed the point where he got whatever polling boost he would have received from announcing his campaign by acting like he's campaigning already.

I didn’t see price changes at least in the provider aspect of what the fee for service was. I would imagine that at some point it could have due to more people having insurance coverage. A lot of places have one fee scale for insurance and then a separate fee scale for no insurance (it’s less money for not having insurance) at least in the outpatient setting. You can’t charge insurances over a certain amount per service code it’s called a fee schedule. It’s an area based number and fluctuates per area. So most are going to bill at the highest they can. Tbh it’s not as much as you think for an office visit. People pay more for eye lashes, fake nails, etc. I don’t know how much Obamacare actually affected that. But I will say because the market place insurance cost so much for so little coverage and you still have high copays and deductibles, yeah things are actually more costly but it’s the insurance company who is winning unless you end up needing major medical care in the hospital. When I was looking at plans as a healthy individual who doesn’t really need to go to the doctor much but like to have coverage just in case. My copays for a specialist was $100. The allowed billable rate  for a level 4 office visits for an established pt is roughly $130. So I pay all of this money a month for insurance and when I need to use it I am still paying damn near the full cost of the appointment, basically insurance was a $30 coupon lol.

PoliticalDiscussion,post,social security,2p7bp4,BeingDS,"Opinion: The proper sphere of influence of American government, according to the intent of the Framers, is spelled out in the Preamble to the Constitution. Let's discuss.","This is a spinoff of [another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/2p2u27/proposed_that_most_of_us_on_the_left_or_right_in/cmt4egt). Feel free to peruse that one if you want some more context. 

I am proceeding from the notion that government and society are not separate entities, that government is the means by which all societies administer themselves; in general by setting a code of conduct and by deciding how resources controlled by that society will be shared and managed. I posit that it is impossible to have a society without a government. Without government, it is impossible for disputes to be bindingly adjudicated, and since it is inevitable that disputes will arise amongst any given group of people; without government, the only options upon a dispute arising are violence or termination of association. The current permutation of a society's government can be altered or discontinued and a new permutation instituted; but without any government at all, a group of people cannot reasonably be referred to as a society. I posit further that two groups of people separately governed are members of separate societies.

I feel that government should have almost unlimited power to act quickly and decisively; given:

1. Accountability and transparency exist such that a concerned citizen can identify and address with the proper individual something that he or she finds improper.

2. Government is beholden to the proper influences -- in the case of American democracy, the votes and petitions of the members of the electorate, in equal measure, without regard to wealth or social standing. 

3. Government is effectively restrained from acting outside its proper sphere of influence (see the [Preamble to the Constitution](http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/preamble)).

I would argue that none of these three things is currently the case. Rather than making me want to limit the government's power, however, I think we should work on repairing the framework of our government and both expanding the good functions and scaling back the bad or misconceived ones; in equal measure. 

Government should be empowered to perform its proper functions.

In response to some pertinent questions from /u/wordwordwordwordword, I replied like this:

>How would you interpret the preamble?

There are as many interpretations of the Preamble as there are people in the United States. Our Constitution is purposefully vague. It is not meant to have one hard-and-fast interpretation, which is why; as Jefferson said; ""the price of liberty is eternal vigilance"". Because the Constitution is so vague, we can't put enforcement of its text on autopilot. The survival and functioning of our government requires the constant and consistent participation of an informed, robust electorate. It is not only our right, but our duty, to give the government our mandate discerningly and sparingly. 

When 60% of us can't be bothered to show up on election day, and almost nobody actually writes to their Congresspeople (despite it being [easier than ever](http://www.contactingthecongress.org) to do so), our government won't (read: can't) take what we want into account, and may appear to have ""gone rogue"" to someone who regards regurgitation of what they hear on the news as ""being informed""; and is unable to understand that ranting on Facebook and taking 2 milliseconds to sign Change.org petitions based only on the title is not ""informed participation"". /rant

That being said, my interpretation would be as follows:

>in order to form a more perfect union

I'll get to why I think this is the most important part of the Preamble in a few paragraphs. What constitutes a ""perfect union"" is highly subjective. I therefore interpret this part as stating the Framers' intention to grant the government the latitude to ensure that the government has a solid framework and a foundation that allows it to do what it is designed to do, based on the mandate granted to it by the people through regular elections and the power of recall.

>establish justice, insure domestic tranquility

I regard these two as being tied together. Basically this reflects the Framers' intent to make the establishment and maintenance of order and justice part of the government's sphere.

>provide for the common defense

Allows the government to establish and maintain a military.

>promote the general welfare

This describes perhaps the most arguably controversial aspect of the government's purview. I view this part of the Preamble as stating the Framers' intent that everyone in society should have an equal right to reap the benefits of the Constitution. Nobody: not the rich, not a certain race or gender, not a certain religion or religious people in general, not a certain sexual orientation; should be favored by policy-makers when it comes to opportunity or access to resources, infrastructure, and upward mobility. 

Based on my interpretation, it falls under the government's purview to ensure that people to whom power, social standing, and wealth accrue to a lesser extent or not at all can nevertheless participate fully in society without undue hardship or adversity.

People to whom these things do accrue are already advantaged enough as a result, and do not need or deserve a government that favors them in addition. 

Of course, the government does do this very frequently, and this is damaging to the union because, unchecked, it can result in the effective disenfranchisement and even dehumanization of certain segments of the population.

This is the part that goes back to my earlier point about forming a more perfect union. The reason the first clause of the Preamble is arguably the most important is that when we have systemic problems with the framework of our government; such as its current failure to include effective checks and balances on the influence of the rich and of faceless, unaccountable corporations over our elected officials; it is critical that the rest of the electorate be able to use the government to reform itself.

>secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity

This last one simply states the Framers' hope that future generations can be made to understand the inherent frailty of our Constitution and their role in protecting and keeping it. If you don't know what's in the Constitution, there's nothing in it. If you don't know what your rights are, you don't have any. The government can't work for you unless you first understand how it works. If we stand by (in ignorance or in apathy) while our officials mishandle public affairs and exceed their authority, then they have no reason not to. 

I'll repeat Jefferson: ""The price of liberty is eternal vigilance"". 

As far as government purview, I feel this is the part that states the Framers' intent to allow the government to influence education. More than any other factor, education affects the ability of members of the electorate to understand the world around them and the actions taken or policies proposed by government. The uneducated or miseducated can be very easily led by the nose, which is the antithesis of how democratic society functions. 

>How would you respond to those who say that #2 is impossible and government can therefore never be trusted

I would say to them that they're wrong. Government needs a proper framework and a vigilant and empowered electorate in order to function democratically. Nothing is perfect, but with the loopholes closed and the populace involved and properly educated, government can be brought under control.

>This paper advances the use of pre-analysis plans in non-experimental research settings. In a study of recent minimum wage changes, we demonstrate how analyses of medium- and long-run impacts of policy interventions can be pre-specified as extensions to short-run analyses. Further, our pre-analysis plan includes comparisons of the effects of large vs. small minimum wage increases, which is a theoretically motivated dimension of heterogeneity. We discuss how these use cases harness the strengths of pre-analysis plans while mitigating their weaknesses. This project’s initial analyses explored CPS and ACS data from 2011 through 2015. Alongside these analyses, we pre-committed to analyses incorporating CPS and ACS data extending through 2019. Averaging across the specifications in our pre-analysis plan, we estimate that relatively large minimum wage increases reduced employment rates among low-skilled individuals by just over 2.5 percentage points. Our estimates of the effects of relatively small minimum wage increases vary across data sets and specifications but are, on average, both economically and statistically indistinguishable from zero. We estimate that medium-run effects exceed short-run effects and that the elasticity of employment with respect to the minimum wage is substantially more negative for large minimum wage increases than for small increases.

TL;DR: Large MW increases have much bigger negative employment elasticities than smaller MW increases",2021-09-21T00:39:40+00:00,t3_ps7ntt

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,income tax,f3oeno7,ChuChuChuChua,,"Regarding “rooting out corruption”, it’s fair to say that while Warren could simply replace officials such as Barr, it’s likely that most of the democratic challengers if not all would “clean house” so to speak, and while Warren has placed herself publicly in the progressive camp, her campaign is not built around key policy proposals, compared to Sanders being known for Medicare for all and student loan forgiveness or Yang’s Freedom Dividend and Democracy Dollars. 

Anti-Corruption reform as Warren proposes in her tax on lobbying while feel good among us political observers, the wider public might not necessarily care, or worse, feed into the narrative that the government is profiting off of lobbying by large corporations. Whether she could change the narrative is up to her, but personally I don’t even think her anti-corruption policies go far enough, considering that I don’t see a public financing of elections included in her plans. That being said, her presidency would likely be a highly top-down regulatory one, and could be a return to traditionally moderate Democratic Party, with gradual reforms. 

Sanders and Yang I would argue that should either of them get their flagship policies passed (which is not unlikely if they are elected), the American public would likely rally to their side, seeing the improvement in day to day life that can be direct attributed to their policies. Sanders’ election (or rather his mere presence) would spark a shift left for Democrats, the same way Trump’s showed a shift right. Sanders, I would argue, if his policies were successful would outcompete a Trump-led Republican Party. Yang despite his currently low polling standing already marks another shift in the Democratic Party, and which I predict will be the sort of second half of the future Democratic Party, if Sanders is the top-down government control (nationalization of power grids as an example) half, Yang would be the bottom-up.

Neoliberal,comment,taxpayer,f165f7l,URZ_,,"> My administration will also take whatever legal steps it can to stop states from preempting local efforts to enact tenant protection laws. More than 30 states have passed laws that explicitly prohibit cities from adopting rent control. Efforts to repeal these state preemption laws have been met with fierce opposition from real estate and private equity giants, who have shelled out massive sums of money to block these proposals. Just last year, firms like New York-based private equity giant Blackstone Group contributed to a $65 million war chest to defeat a ballot initiative in California that would have repealed a state law making it harder for cities to control housing costs.
These state laws effectively permit Wall Street to decide what’s best for cities and towns instead of the residents of those places choosing for themselves. It’s wrong, and as President, I will do whatever I can to stop and reverse these industry-backed efforts to take power away from cities and towns.
My plan will lower rents, take a first step towards closing the racial wealth gap, and make it easier for Americans to access affordable housing. Enacting the plan will be a top priority of my administration — because every American deserves a safe, decent, and affordable place to live.

For the record, that California ballot initiative she claims was defeated due to private equity was Proposition 10, a terrible proposal that would have lead to major Californian cities entrenching themselves even further than they already are. It's great that she wants to throw billions at the problem (billions i for the record would love to know where she would get from), but unless you fundamentally put an end to the problems that have lead to a housing shortage/rent increases, you are merely delaying further shortages down the road.

I think a lot of people don’t realize just how pointless that is when your Rep is MAGA. 

MAGA reps are quite clear that they aren’t listening or voting based on what their constituents want. 

Hell, mine doesn’t interact with the electorate unless you fork over $500 a head for a shitty dinner. No town halls, nothing. Just a very, very small group of donors even have access to my Rep. she’s locked up pretty tight in her bubble. She’ll claim that she represents the “will of the people” but I don’t see how she even knows what that will is when she doesn’t campaign, doesn’t meet with constituents (unless they’ve paid for the shitty dinner), doesn’t even send out a Fuck You form response to letters. 

My district doesn’t have a high count of seniors because the cities in my district have intentionally pushed seniors out (they don’t really contribute to the tax base) by zoning all the housing to family type homes. Seniors here are downsized out of the district because there’s no housing for them. They’re welcome here while they’re in their high earning years but once they hit the age of knee replacements - GTFO!

Conservative,post,sales tax,9ar6x2,IndefinitePresent,What Will Happen When the ANC Takes My Farm - The Plans of a White South African Farmer,"I have no doubt that the ANC Govt has given a lot of thought to the topic of Expropriation Without Compensation (EWC) however I think they might not have fully comprehended the consequences of such a policy. **As a farmer I thought it might be useful to enlighten them as to the course of action I would take once my farm is targeted for EWC.** Before I continue I would like to emphasize that this is not a threat nor delivered with the mindset of a saboteur, it is merely a description of the sequence of events that would unfold in the event of such a policy being enforced.

* I would immediately identify all the moveable assets on my farm and start selling them or placing them in a suitable storage facility. I list these below simply to demonstrate to non-farmers what makes a farm functional and profitable. The first to go would be all the livestock followed by all the machinery including tractors, pumps, silos, centre pivots, electrical transformers, irrigation equipment, water troughs, implements and piping. I would strip the dairy and sell the bulk tanks, milking machines etc. I would take down all internal fencing on the farm and recoup what I could. All sheds would be disassembled and all houses and other buildings would be stripped of anything sellable, including their roofs.

* I would disconnect/cancel the 5 Eskom points on the farm and obtain refunds on the deposits I’ve paid on them.

* I would re-trench all my staff and pay them off in accordance with the Labour Act. I would then strip all the staff accommodation on the farm and sell what I could.

* With the sale of all my livestock and cessation of the farming operation I would immediately default on the R5.5m I owe FNB but I wouldn’t worry as the farm is the loan’s security and I don’t really own anything else.

* When the day came to leave the farm I would hand the ‘keys’ over to the new ‘owners’ but I’m not quite sure what they would do as there’d be no roof on the farm house and there would be nothing to ‘farm’ on the farm. It would just be a piece of land, but that’s ok because the ANC says owning land makes you wealthy.




When you take the sequence of events described above and multiply it on a national scale you see another sequence of events unfolding.

* The new ‘farmers’ arrive on the farm but there is no livestock, machinery or working capital to continue the operation.

* They go to the banks to borrow money (A good farming habit) but the banks are sitting on a R160 Billion defaulted debt book from the ‘old’ farmers and won’t lend a cent to agriculture. They’re fighting for their own survival now.

* The Govt doesn’t have the money, which would be far more than the R160 Billion mentioned above, to re-capitalise and finance all the farms so most of the farms either fall derelict or are farmed at a subsistence level.

* There is a massive but short-term surplus of Beef, Sheep and Poultry products due to the sell-off by the previous farmers. This brings prices down drastically in the short term but eventually the meat runs out and there is nothing to replace it. Meat prices skyrocket.

* Dairy products cease almost immediately after the livestock cull/sell-off and within weeks there is a critical shortage of all dairy products. Importing is impossible due to the Govt’s actions which have decimated the value of the Rand.

* Maize lasts quite a bit longer and with careful rationing will endure until the next season but there is no crop in the ground for next year due to the new ‘farmers’ lack of machinery, experience and access to credit.

* All agricultural Co-Ops and suppliers very quickly cease operation and/or go bankrupt and re-trench all their staff. They cannot survive by selling single bags of seed and fertilizer to subsistence farmers.

* All processors of agricultural products such as meat, dairy and maize cease operation due to lack of product and re-trench all their staff.

* Rural Municipalities start to feel the pinch as there are no longer any farmers paying rates and the agricultural businesses in the towns have also sold up and left.

* Smaller rural towns that depended on agriculture eventually collapse and rural communities are forced to travel long distances to major centres to find ever dwindling supplies.

* Ironically the EWC movement creates more Urbanisation as the rural folk flee the agricultural desert that has been created.

* All food dependent enterprises such as fast food chains and restaurants either disappear or are greatly reduced…along with all their staff.

* With all the unemployed farmworkers, as well as those who have lost their jobs from other sectors, there is an unsustainable demand on the UIF system and it soon collapses.

* The Social Grant system teeters as the ripple effect from the agricultural collapse enters all sectors and the tax-base is shredded.

* Food riots become common and genuine hunger and poverty widespread.

* Unlike Zimbabwe the South African population has nowhere to run.

* With the White Farmer no longer an available target and the true ‘value’ of land revealed in all its fallacy the masses turn on the only target they have left. The ANC.

Politics,comment,minimum wage,gq09426,Gold_Karma,,"If you have kids, this is a big win for you. You’d still get the $1400 stimulus check for each child and yourself, plus the original child tax credit went up from 2,000 per child to 3,600 or 3,000 if 6 and older.  

They are proposing sending those child tax increases to you directly as a check starting this summer instead of having to wait to get it back as a tax refund like usual. 

So for example. My wife and I have three kids under 6. We will get a $7,000 stimulus check from the $1400.

We will start getting $300 checks for each of our kids for the child tax increase. $900 dollars a month when they start distributing those.

*Edit because I rethought how much I will actually increase by with the child tax because I realized I already receive over half of that $900 currently with the $2000 child tax that is already in place. 

I keep seeing major news articles out there stating people are going to get $300 checks per child with the new tax credit and this is not true because you are already getting a little more than half that now. It’s just most people don’t have their W4’s set up to claim their dependents and they get $2000 back as a refund per child
at the end of the year. 

Right now you are getting $166 a month per child from the current tax credit in place of $2000 per year. 2000/12 = 166. So really you are getting an increase of $134 per month per child, 1600/12 = 133.33. So for me and my 3 children, I can expect the irs to automatically increase my paycheck by $400 total for my 3 children. Since I have my W4 claim my dependents.

Or if they don’t do it automatically a check for about $400 a month. That’s a lot different than what the news about these child tax credits will have you think at first. When I was first looking at it, I thought I would get 300 x 3 children = $900 a month. The problem is, I’ve already been getting more than half that already with the current tax credit.

So, disclaimer, don’t forget about the refund you are already getting. If the government decides to send you your refund in whole with this new child tax increase, but broken up over 12 months, then don’t expect your usual child tax refund at the end of the year.

*Second edit to add, I’m just a fifth grade teacher trying to figure this out like the rest of you. If you have technical questions, contact a cpa after this gets made into law and they will be able to help you a lot more specifically than I can.",2021-03-06T20:02:30+00:00,t1_gpzvip0

Geopolitics,comment,social security,eeu17m8,exploding_cat_wizard,,"> Most of the austerity measures that cripple the european countries where forced by the European Commission and the ECB, hence it's not far fetched to say that the liberalisation caused most of the important changes in our european society.

There are only a few countries actually crippled by austerity. Those that would be crippled by spending every fucking Euro on interest payments otherwise, because they outspent themselves foolishly. While I disagree with many of the austerity measures that have been imposed on Greece, nobody forced them to become an ineffectual corrupt state that spent far more than it should have. It's just that within the Eurozone, the old standby of devaluing the currency instead of changing the overspending and corruption doesn't work anymore. Similar things could be said of Italy, though they are floating along for now. 

>European institutions which obviously lack representativeness

The central bank? That's independent, as it is in all economically successful liberal democracies, true. The heads of no central bank used to be, or are, elected in Europe, or indeed anywhere I know of.

The parliament? Obviously representative. The Council is basically the US Senate in the 19th century, though with more power - the democratic mandate stems from the people of the individual countries electing representatives to send to the Council. 

The same is true of the Commission - an executive not chosen by the Parliament or a direct election, but by the individual, democratically legitimized nations within Europe. You might complain that this is too much indirection, but in most member states, including France, you've got little say who actually runs the government - the ministers are all appointed, just like the council.

Finally, to get back to the actual point, the Commission has pretty much zero actual power to impose austerity on anyone. It was the majority of member states via the Council (and in Eurozone cases, the unofficial but equivalent gathering of all the member states) that is the driver of this. Without those, nothing can happen. Not even a unanimous vote in both Commission and Parliament could change that - the EU is still a confederation of nation states, not a federation of federal states. And France voted in just as much austerity on European nations as did Germany. It seems that they've got no good alternative story to sell, only crappy ones - those damn Muslims, for example - or ones people don't believe in anymore - see the socialists.",2019-01-24T09:50:39+00:00,t1_eerfqzl

Liberal,comment,taxpayer,c7nyj14,Duncanconstruction,,"I'll clear up your misconceptions about the Canadian welfare system. I've been on Ontario Works while working part time (I was 22 years old, had been laid off from one of my jobs and the other wasn't enough to pay the bills). I was given 650$ per month to cover everything... food, rent, transportation, etc. Every dollar I earned through my part time job went to Ontario Works, up to the 650$. I was required to give them all of my financial information (including a signed document from my landlord stating how much rent was per month with banking statements for the previous 3 months to back that number up). I also had to bring in my paycheck stub every month so they could deduct what I earned from my government cheque. If you think that's too generous, then I don't know what to say. I could barely afford to eat by the time the end of the month came around. I was on OW for 3 months, found a great job and have never been more financially stable in my life.

 Your family member is committing welfare fraud. It has nothing to do with the generosity of the government. It's akin to saying that wal mart gives out free tv's because your family member paid nothing for that flat screen TV she shoplifted.

After reading your post I think that this is just a classic case of somebody who is under-informed and lacking a teensy bit of empathy for anybody who has a different life circumstance than you.

Conservative,comment,taxpayer,jkqjlka,Secund2nun,,"I agree. White liberals are the worst. Many of them (except the moderates) believe all of the liberal agenda including the lgbqt trans men can become pregnant BS. The non-white liberals actually oppose the lqbqt woke trans BS part at least along with some other woke parts of the platform. They also don't hate the US, unlike most white liberals and many African American liberals.

This is based off of my memory, but Cubans are obviously the highest, especially older ones. Dominican men are up there also. They have high rates of being Republicans. The women not anywhere as much as the men (not a shocker bc we all know men are more likely to be conservative than women), but DR women are still probably somewhat to slightly higher than other female immigrant groups. South Asians are more Republican than most other immigrant groups also, but not as much as whites.  Mexicans (especially the men) are trending Republican thanks to the woke liberal policies, but there are still many liberals among them, especially females.

By far the most liberal groups are Puerto Ricans and African American females. African American men don't see to care about voting, but they are usually liberal but at noticably lower rates than the females. The few MAGA African Americans I have met have all been men.

Geopolitics,post,tax,d619ku,caonim,US debt problem,"At present, the US government's fiscal debt is 22 trillion US dollars, plus the state's debt of 6 trillion US dollars, a total of 28 trillion US dollars, while the US GDP  last year was 20 trillion US dollars.

If the average debt growth rate for the next five years does not change, then the total US debt will reach 38 trillion US dollars. This means that the US government's debt ratio may exceed 150%, while the US government generally requires the debt ceiling not to exceed 70% of GDP, and 100% is in the alarm stage.

If there are 40 trillion US dollars of debt, averagely ten-year debt. The US needs to pay back 4 trillion dollars a year. And the interest of 40 trillion US dollars is almost 1.1 trillion US dollars, which adds up to 5 trillion US dollars each year. It is almost equivalent to the tax that can be generated by US GDP, which means that even if all the taxes are used to pay back debt every year, it is still not enough..

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,minimum wage,evdmt6t,richraid21,,"**Pay Gap**

Regarding the pay-gap, I have my own anecdotal evidence as to some of the drivers but I'll start with two quotes and build from there:   

- [Nearly half of US female scientists leave full-time science after first child](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00611-1)


- Many employers and industries prioritize traditional work hours rather than flexible
schedules, a preference that tends to put women
with children at a disadvantage (Goldin, 2014)

These two factors have a big impact on how employers view their employees: 

1. Hiring someone is an investment
2. The cost of hiring can be quite large depending on the field
3. If you quantity the cost to hire vs the expected (or duration) of output it begins to become clear why, under some circumstances, a pay gap exists. 

I don't claim the circumstances are fair, but they do exist and it would be quite naive to ignore them as future policies designed to help women could hurt them in the long run if more perverse incentives are created to hiring. 

Regarding my own anecdotal evidence I mentioned at the start, I work in software at a Fortune 100 company. Since I started ~2years ago I've seen 3 women have a child, take their full paid maternity leave then quit immediately once they return. It's a hard situation to balance, especially for a large employer.

**Minimum Wage:**

> Pass a $15 federal minimum wage 

Once again we have a proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to a number that is just created out of thin air. Pete provides no justification as to why the minimum wage should be $15 but not $14 or $16.

This kind of policy making is horrible, especially for economic policy. I'm no fan of the minimum wage, but there are much better arguments, and I would even compromise if we made it easier for states to set local minimum wages that are more tailored to the COL in that specific area.",2019-07-29T23:15:18+00:00,t3_cibkyw

The size of the company will allow effective price negotiation, and the plans will be cheaper because healthy people will be mixed in with sick people at a better ratio.

Democrats,post,social security,6iz7la,bubba-natep,Can we talk Tip O'Neill,"So, on r/politics there was this [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/democrats-will-keep-losing-unless-they-do-this/2017/06/22/9eefb7c4-576e-11e7-ba90-f5875b7d1876_story.html?utm_term=.1f3f47311dd3) (x-post from politics). It was down-voted some, but I usually read these things because I find it interesting from a strategy point of view (how would a pro-life Democrat do in the South, etc.). 

Anyways, my favorite part of the article:

>The party’s latest setback has only heightened its internal tensions, with some calling for the ouster of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). But an even bigger challenge for Democratic leaders will be managing the intra-party fight between left-wing heretic hunters and more moderate forces hoping to rebuild Franklin D. Roosevelt’s coalition of ideologically diverse allies. Roosevelt’s melange of Northern progressives and Southern conservatives passed Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the Civil Rights Act. It dominated Congress for most of the 20th century. Tearing down that big tent in favor of a more ideologically homogenized movement would be a recipe for political disaster. 

>Instead, to win nationally, Democrats must start thinking locally. Tip O’Neill famously said that all politics are local, and the liberal Boston speaker of the House practiced what he preached. Because of it, O’Neill’s party dominated national politics for decades by recruiting conservatives in the South, moderates in the Midwest and liberals in large industrial states. That embrace of ideological diversity kept Republicans in the political wilderness for 40 years, and I saw the strategy’s impact firsthand during my time in Congress, even during a period when Republicans were in control of the House.

>In 1998, Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina and I traveled the country helping Republicans in tough election fights. One night we found ourselves in a conservative Kentucky district where the Republican should have been ahead by 20 points. I pulled the candidate aside and began peppering him with questions.

>“How weak is your opponent on the Second Amendment?”

>“Oh, he’s got a 100 percent rating with the NRA,” came the response. 

>“What about abortion? Any weaknesses there?” I asked. 

> “The guy is pro-life.”

>I smiled, excused myself and walked over to Graham. “Enjoy the hors d’oeuvres. This race is over.” 

Now, as a progressive, it's tough. It's tough to consider comprising on things I care about. As a strategy, though, maybe it is time we revisit what O'Neill did. Now, I don't see the Ossoff loss as doomsday, nor the Montana loss. We ran a poor candidate in Red Montana, and ran not just a liberal in Georgia, but a Bernie liberal. My meaning is I'm not yet ready to through out a certain purity in the party, but I am willing to maybe consider comprises that will garner good will at the local area of a typically non-liberal area.

If it is broadly referencing the deal that Pelosi, Schumer, Biden agreed to, then the failure to follow through on that deal still lands at their feet.  If they couldn't deliver on it, don't promise it, especially publicly.

>2: those 2 senators are the strongest part of the senate, what they say goes, that's political reality. They hold all 52 cards and the joker.

That may be true or not, but it doesn't change the fact that they should be put to the question.  Why are they holding up the president's agenda?  In the case of a failure to pass the reconciliation bill:  Why did they tank the president's agenda?

The Progressive caucus has been consistent in backing up the president's agenda; they will pass both bills.

&#x200B;

I had this same problem last year and was able to get in touch with a financial advisor who helped me for free. I just can't remember exactly what we did and I've been unable to get in touch with anyone else so far.

I am a resident of MO and my income this year is between 10 and 11K (I'm a student). I did my application and sure enough it says I am too poor to qualify for tax credit, but I don't qualify for medicare. (I'm young, non military, single, generally healthy etc).  My memory is foggy but I seem to recall that the advisor and I fixed the problem by pulling my application and recreating it and essentially overestimating my income so it was right at the poverty level, allowing me to get the tax credit, which did not result in penalties. Does this sound accurate?

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,income tax,d01jwg0,analog-heaven,,"This is a very general response to some misunderstandings in this thread that no one has brought up. I hope I'm not stating the obvious too much.

I read your source, you are misunderstanding the statistic in your first point. You said degree completion rate is 31%. That means 31% of all Germans are expected to complete university level education at some point in their life. It does *not* mean that only 31% of university students graduate like you said. Those 31% attend university for free and the other 69% do not attend university and do not use government resources or put debt on the shoulders of the country as you put it. Obviously there's a small percentage that attend and do not graduate, and I didn't try to find any specific numbers, but it is not 69% of the German population.

I don't know if this needs stating but it seems like it does... no one is pointing out that Sanders' plan is specifically only for public colleges and universities. Private schools would still be private and still charge tuition. If the public schools have no tuition however, this will put pressure on private schools to reduce costs and lower tuition to remain competitive. This will help reduce the debt burden on people who choose to go to private schools anyway, which is an important goal.

Finally everyone thinks that making a university tuition free makes it worthless. ""If everyone can get it there's nothing special about it"" yeah I understand that, but that's not what would happen. It's not like Bernie flips a switch and suddenly every school is required by law to admit every single applicant. They will still have admissions standards. People will still apply and then be accepted or rejected. The important difference is that the applicant will know that if they are accepted to a public college they won't have to worry about tuition. Choosing a public university to apply to will be a situation where you ask ""can I get in? Do I have the test scores and GPA?"" instead of ""can I afford it?"" or ""how much debt will I have in 4 years?""",2016-02-16T04:31:48+00:00,t3_45zfdj

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,social security,gw21rtg,no_idea_bout_that,,"The biggest benefit is maintaining the status quo. We see relinquishing military power as creating a void for the next power, and they're usually not seen as better replacements of American power. We may not fully trust our own military, but at least we have more say in controlling it compared to how much authority we have over the taliban, Russia or China. For example most Americans believe we need to return Afghanistan to the Afghanis peacefully, but also believe if we withdraw troops that will not happen when the taliban takes control of the country from the current government. (So we'll see what happens when troops are withdrawn in September.)

For current tangible benefits, American businesses benefit by predictable and safe international markets. 

It's hard to say if the American people benefit from this as much. Personal investments are doing great, but only 55% of Americans are invested in the stock market. Many geographic areas are being left behind due to globalization, but many others are booming (especially with foreign real estate purchases). Cheaper goods is a trivial benefit, but harms American production and makes American supply vulnerable to unpredictable markets (shipping disruptions, pandemics, wars, sanctions).",2021-04-27T14:54:36+00:00,t1_gw0qai8

Neoliberal,comment,minimum wage,jglm8t4,shitpostsuperpac,,">	Get your certainty from the things you truly care about, and I’m going to be honest here, caring about something as nebulous and impersonal and generalizing as “workers” or “the people” is so difficult that I think those who say they do are lying to themselves almost all the time.

In the spirit of open and honest conversation, caring about nebulous and general things is about the most human thing I can think of. I don’t know how you could design a system meant for human beings without relying on emotional intelligence. I gotta be honest, I was really tripped up when you used the word “impersonal” to help define the act of “caring about … the people”.

So I have a question.

Do you personally find it difficult to care about “nebulous” things like “workers” and “the people” as you say?

I ask because this is honestly quite foreign to me. For me, If I’m walking down the street and I catch sight of a newspaper headline like “Nurses strike for better conditions” or whatever - I experience a good, positive feeling. I’m not lying for internet points. I do feel this positive connective force, this feeling of care and support for people I don’t personally know. Put to words, it is “Hell yeah! Go get what you deserve!”

Why? Because I have depended on nurses for my own well-being and the well-being of people I love. I have dated a nurse. I have had friends who are nurses. I have observed and listened to their experiences to such a degree that I subconsciously have built a better understanding of their experience. Even camaraderie, despite having never worked in healthcare myself.

I agree with you that one needs to approach healthcare policy, occupational policy, and so on with a rational and logical mind. I get that part. What I don’t understand is how one can arrive at a political position without using feelings. What I really don’t understand is how one could arrive at a political position that respects and preserves something as nebulous as human dignity without that foundation of care.

Also, apologies in advance if you feel as though I have mischaracterized your thoughts. Internet can be an imperfect tool of communication.",2023-04-17T11:51:03+00:00,t1_jgknz84

And yea, the DCCC elections are frankly a stunning turn in SF politics. I thought that the moderate faction may get a handful of extra folks elected, but it’s for all intents and purposes a sweep. Mike Chen (who is active on the /r/SF sub) won a seat, and Bilal (who is likely to unseat the loathsome Dean Preston for supe of the tenderloin district) also ranked highly and will get a spot. 

If this momentum carries over into the BOS elections in 2024, and we prevent Aaron Peskin from taking the mayorship, this could really be a generational shift in SF politics. The “progressive” faction essentially abandoned progressive outcomes in order to advocate for rent seeking on behalf of wealthy, entrenched incumbents - and this is them reaping what they sow. SF has been so grotesquely held back by these decades-long regressive policies, it’s so refreshing to see possibility of real change.",2024-03-07T08:42:56+00:00,t3_1b8kggq
Politics,comment,tax,l01q92q,Numerous_Photograph9,,"With abortion, it was voted to become a constitutional ammendment.  Since it passed, some state senators have been trying to change the law, and say that the courts aren't allowed to interprit the constitution.  They can't change the constitution itself, but want to keep it where there General Assembly(state congress) gets to decide how it's to be enforced, or what exact rights are laid out in the amendment...which also seems dumb since it specifies 22 weeks, but whatever...you know they'd come up with some BS ""compromise""

With MJ, it's not an ammendment, but a law to be enacted.  It's still up to the general assembly to decide how it should be enacted, and lay out regulations for it's sale and distribution.  This is what they're slow walking, and could be a while before all the detail are laid out.  At least at this time, it's not illegal to possess or light up in the state, but may be a while before we see widespread retail outlets selling it.

A few years ago they also basically procrastinated redrawing district maps, ordered by the court, until they were told to use the maps because they ran out of time for the election.  After the election, they got a new supreme court, which ruled the old maps were fine.  We now have a ballot initiative petition to force independently drawn maps, which hopefully will go onto the November ballot.  Too soon to say what they may try there, but even if they keep getting rebuked, chances are they'll maintain power, and given that they'd lose a lot with fairly drawn maps, I expect a high amount of ratfuckery to subvert the will of the people there.",2024-04-17T21:10:34+00:00,t1_l00xgby
