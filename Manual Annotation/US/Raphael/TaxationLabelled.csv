The issue I take with this is that it's not the argument being presented.  The article itself is only focusing on the shift of trade deficit which is a Trump talking point (he literally campaigned on this).  Again, any real economist can tell you a trade deficit is not a positive or negative indicator of a strong economy, yet it was sold to people that it is.

So is the issue China's unethical dealings or that we operate at a trade deficit?  How about we start there and then move forward?

For all the good things he's done (SCOTUS pick, embassy move, yanking Iran deal, deregulating government, Tax cuts)...the tariffs are dumb and are going to come back and bite us in the ass.

...UNLESS it actually does work and China is willing to move on their unethical practices.  But you have to ask yourself, is a country that does all the BS that China does really care if a trade war hurts their people?  They seems like they are willing to let their people suffer knowing it will overall hurt us more if we suffer.

Heavily regulated? How do you define, ""heavily?"" Washington only had four cabinet members. You do realize that the United States didn't have a personal income tax until the Civil War, and it was rescinded shortly after and not reinstated until WWI (1913, to be exact). 

>I don't know what law you are talking about.

Seriously? I hope you don't practice medicine as badly as you practice being obtuse.

>Some of the first hospitals in the US were paid for by taxes shortly after they opened

Yes, but NOT ALL. That is the point of individual liberty. Unlike Obamascare (which mandates that everyone must purchase healthcare), citizens were at least free to move somewhere without those taxes if they chose to. 

Yes, I know that rules and regs are created after the law is signed. But why don't you admit that the President's decrees do fundamentally change the law? How can the law not have been changed if the 'law' requires that individual mandates begin on ""X"" date when now they won't? Did the House of Representatives draft an amendment to make that change? No, the President just decided to change it.

The fundamental difference between liberals and conservatives is that you want bureaucratic nightmares like this as a way to get to what you really want: socialized medicine, controlled and run by the government. I don't want that, because I fear the overwhelming hunger of an out-of-control government that believes it knows best.  The UCA isn't really about healthcare- it's about control, as I'm sure you refuse to admit. 

When it comes down to it, Doc, you're a policy troll. Please take your meaningless UCA factoids back to r/politics where they love your ilk. You're not convincing anyone here. ",2014-03-23T21:50:18+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

You want free money from the federal government.

Who gave you the debt relief? The federal government. The tax man.

So you hate the tax man when they want you to pay taxes. But you love the tax man when they want to hand out free money. 

I guess there’s illiterate people on both sides of the aisle.

Obviously if you calculate this out, you should take the debt relief and pay your taxes. It’s hilarious that you want to “have your cake and eat it too”. Here you are begging for handouts.

The budget also calls for a permanent expansion of enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage that he pushed through Congress but are set to expire after 2025.

In other unfinished business, the budget outlines a 10-year, $150 billion increase for Medicaid home- and community-based services after a major expansion he campaigned on in 2020 was set aside by Congress.

It also renews Biden's call to create a federal coverage option for low-income people in states that haven't expanded Medicaid under the ACA.

""While my administration has seen great progress since day one, there is still work to do. My budget will help make that promise real,"" Biden wrote in his budget.

The $130.7 billion health care budget also proposes increases for public health preparedness funding and greater support for mental health and substance use disorder treatment, including requiring that insurers' provider networks include enough behavioral health providers.

It also calls for a more than $2 billion increase for the cancer moonshot, a core part of Biden's ""unity"" agenda that aims to bridge partisan divides.

Compared with budgets in previous years, it also places a greater emphasis on health care cybersecurity as the industry increasingly is targeted by hackers.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug administration, is the main reason, beside his boss Trump sitting in the White House, why our cost of essential medicines are going north as they say instead of going south.

That is the main reason why we cannot allow an incompetent commissioner and a crooked drug czar called Alex Azar, the current United States Secretary of Health and Human Services and Trump, the businessman president to continue to function anymore.

People in those cities and in blue states tend to contribute more to the federal budget while supporting low tax states that tend to take more money from the federal government.

""Anybody who wants to argue Covid is dangerous is a virologist.""

What other expert authority would we listen to about the effects of minimum wage on job loss? The field has specifically studied the secondary impacts of raising wages, though we don't have much historic data on doubling minimum wage in regions already economically depressed.

There are always trade-offs in public policy. Whether the negatives outweigh the positives is the question. If racial equity is a concern, there's indication that minority economies will be especially hard hit if minwage is raised too fast without enacting additional programs. I've been looking for these in current proposals but haven't seen much of substance.

Economists aren't advocating in their own interests, or for the wealthy.  They're giving us as scientific a perspective as they can, and it's up to us to debate the moral trade-offs between raising median wages for the average semi-skilled worker and net job losses in minority and rural economies.",2021-02-09T14:22:34+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

In the event of an invasion of Eritrea, Ethiopia would be isolated. This wouldn’t be an issue considering that Ethiopia eclipses its neighbours in sheer numbers, but political alliances in the Horn of Africa are independent of national borders. A war on Eritrea would not be a clean cut war between nation states.

Assab is settled by the Afar people who have a presence in Djibouti, Eritrea and Ethiopia. They have long sought independence from Ethiopia and would likely side with Eritrea in this conflict, despite the majority of Afar living in Ethiopia. It’s also this ethnic tie that Ethiopian nationalists use to lay claim on Assab. The idea being that the Afar region in Ethiopia would be incorporated into the Afar region of Ethiopia, but the Afar have no desire for this. 

The biggest backers of this war would be Ethiopian nationalists - largely composed of Amhara + Ethiosemite minorities and Oromo Ethiopianists/nationalists (not to be confused with Oromia nationalists - which are secessionists). The problem is that the Amhara are currently at war with the government, Amhara also allied with Eritrea in their dismantling of Tigray (Eritrea’s primary enemy). All these factions mentioned probably don’t even account for half of Ethiopia’s population.

In an event of war, it’s extremely unlikely that Oromo and Somalis, the former being large in numbers and on the door step of Addis Ababa. Somalis are also able to choke the only road to Djibouti, as well as draw resources from the Somali-dominated Djibouti.

Totally disagree, not just because Latvia or Estonia aren't Slavic. There's also Poland bordering Kaliningrad but without any Russian minorities. 

This is actually the naive way of thinking that brought us here. People in the west should finally realize that they will not change Russians, they will not influence them by example or the knowledge. The English speaking, seemingly educated Russians in the vast majority are also supporting Putin and the war, even those that are living in the west hates it and support Russia. 

From what we can see the influence is going actually the opposite way, the Russian government propaganda has plenty of followers in the west and even some active or former policy makers in the EU and US.

The UAE and Bahrain are firmly in the Saudi camp, but Qatar has gone its own route and sought to be viewed as a neutral party and peace broker in the region. It hosts Al Jazeera, a news network known for relatively high quality reporting in the ME that's banned in Saudi Arabia and many other countries, and has served as a diplomatic broker for many organizations, including terrorist organizations like the Taliban. This has gotten them in hot water with many Muslim countries, especially Saudi Arabia. 

Many analysts believe a desire to stay in Iran's good graces is a major factor for Qatar's strategy; while Qatar is predominantly Sunni and has very good ties with the United States, which would seemingly make them a prime ally for the Saudis, it shares the world's largest natural gas field with Iran, and has  close economic ties with the Islamic Republic. After the 2017 diplomatic crisis with the Saudis, UAE, and Egypt, it increased ties with Iran even more, and at this point their main geopolitical goal is probably to not get overthrown by the Saudis.

In fact, the majority of the population are against them, as shown in the post (if you actually bothered to read it before replying).

What a dumb excuse. Is then funneling 11 billion to their mansions in Qatar also an inevitability? You're really looking for any excuse to shift blame.

>When a group of humans' security is threatened, they are going to support military action.

Again, they don't support it. And considering the blockade was only put in place because of Hamas, how Israel was lifting restrictions prior to October 7th, and how every single one of the wars between Israel and Gaza was started by Hamas, your argument entirely falls apart.

>because they cannot trade with the outside world.

Before this war, Gaza's exports were worth $134 million per year, mostly going to Israel and the west bank. In fact, Gaza's fishing economy is entirely reliant on export to Israeli markets. So Hamas also fully knowingly tanked those by attacking Israel.

>And before the present blockade, Gaza was under occupation by the IDF.

That's false. Israel occupied Gaza between 1967-2005. In 2005 it entirely pulled out. The blockade only started in 2008, a year after Hamas came into power and used the lack of blockade to attack Israel. 

>When IDF snipers are taking pot shots at your children for fun

Your argument is entirely based on emotion rather than any actual factual information. Fact of the matter is, if you ask any expert they'll tell you the leading cause of extremism is poverty, which Hamas very intentionally breeds, as shown above. 

>So what's your thesis?
That if Hamas wouldn't steal billions of dollars of **humanitarian aid**, that money would've actually gone to the Gazan population. What's your thesis?

Healthcare,comment,income,eew79n9,wijwijwij,,"Good news. 

You won't be penalized for 2018.

You live in a state that didn't expand Medicaid.

So if your income is under 138% of federal poverty level, you can simply use Form 8965 code G and be exempt from the penalty. 

138% of 12060 = 16643

Your income is below that. 

So no penalty for you. Just include Form 8965 and in Part III use code G. Check the instructions for Form 8965, page 3, and you'll see a table listing this special ""live in a state that did not expand Medicaid"" exemption.

Also, technically there is a penalty in 2019: It's $0.

Liberal,comment,tax,fcqwd5b,StonerMeditation,,"FBI warns of scam: WASHINGTON—Noting that millions have already fallen victim to the long-running grift, the FBI warned Monday of the ‘American Dream’ scam. “Reports are coming in all across the country of Americans who were promised great prosperity and success in exchange for a lifetime of hard work, only to find themselves swindled and left with virtually nothing,” said agent Dean Winthrop, who explained that susceptible parties are made to believe that class mobility is possible simply through ability or achievement, despite the fact that innumerable social, economic, and racial barriers prevent the vast majority of U.S. citizens from attaining even marginal amounts of upward movement. “Many even travelled across the world to live in what they were calling ‘The Land Of Opportunity,’ a fictitious meritocratic society where any person can simply work their way up from the bottom. The victims, it appears, were drawn in by wild promises about equitable access to wealth, education, and home ownership, but before they knew it, they got played for suckers.” Winthrop added that they haven’t identified the scheme’s kingpin, but are investigating a number of upper-middle class white men who have suspiciously benefitted from the longtime scam.

""SJW"" is a right wing snarl word. No different than ""liberals are the real racists"" and it is used in the same context. It used to be that when liberals rightly accused conservatives of racist talk they would ""snarl"" back with ""liberals are the real racists"". That no longer works because the racist politics used by the right are blindingly clear now. So now they've changed tactics. That's all this is.

Not at all. Fascism: ""an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization.""

Libertarian,post,allowance,18ept50,future_pirate,What type of libertarian am I?,"Just a short list of my beliefs:

\-Make taxes voluntary (EDIT: maybe ""taxes"" isn't the right word anymore, more like voluntary payments of some sort)

\-Eliminate zoning, repeal any business and building regulations not necessary for safety

\-I'm ok with the government doing philanthropy within its own borders with voluntary taxes (if the money is there after funding police/military) but it would be more like a charity in that case.

\-Pro-choice, support legal abortion to at least 24 weeks (which is pretty standard in US democrat stronghold states)

\-Very liberal and probably moreso than most liberals on LBGT and sexual issues, even support legalization of incest between consenting adults, legalized prostitution, and deregulating marriage (meaning a church or organization can choose to only marry a man and a woman while another can let someone marry their 5 pet dogs)

\-Free speech absolutist, offensive/obscene speech or even false information should have full first amendment protection. Against regulating the internet at all besides fraud (e.g. against attempts to ban tiktok or require uploading an ID to view pornography)

\-Against any gun control beyond restricting ownership by violent felons, a lot of the laws they have in California for example seem crazy and written by people who want to look like they're doing something but don't understand guns

\-Support legalizing all drugs to the point you can buy heroin at your local Wal-Mart

\-Support open borders, would literally want an EU-style border between the US and Mexico. I think drug legalization and allowing all immigrants to legally get jobs would solve a lot of the problems that stem from immigration and we also need immigration due to declining birthrates

\-I like the idea of the NAP, support legalizing all nonviolent crime other than property/financial or anything that harms people or property.

\-Abolish foreign aid but private charities are welcome to perform humanitarian efforts overseas

\-The only functions of government would be a violent/property crime/fraud police force and a defensive military which is welcome to hire private contractors and to sell weapons or even mercenary services when it is not unethical to do so which could be an additional source of income for the government",2023-12-09T23:17:17+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Libertarian,comment,debt,i5rjy3j,Andras89,,"So much to unpack here. I'll take a stab at it..

>Fiat money is “i owe you” note and technically anyone is able to create “money”.

Actually, there are very few people able to create money, legally, if we're talking about fiat. If we're talking about creating a crypto currency or lets say you took a particular metal and stamped your own coins, then I think that's okay?

But definitely, you will go to jail for a long time if you counterfeit money.

>If everyone was always repaying debt, no need in centralized currency would exist as people would just trade signed notes with confidence.

>But since it s not the case we use guarantor such as banks and government (that represents all people in a country) to sort of even out and bear the risks of individual defaults.

If everyone was repaying debt.. and we went to savings instead of holding debt, there would be no money. Its as simple as that.

Money that is saved on an account is not sitting somewhere. It went out to loan on someone/something else. That is how they create money.

>Nation becomes neither richer nor poorer every time government does it because nation sort of owes it to itself.

>No more and no less goods are produced or consumed directly because of that.

1. The Banks create the money. The Government creates bonds/treasuries to get money created by banks...
2. A nation becomes poorer if the money supply increases since it devalues the dollar. The supply of something increases, the demand and value/price decreases.. Its simple economics.

>Instead, it is nothing but another way of production/consumption redistribution, in addition to taxes.

>I stopped looking at dollars long ago, instead i look at production and consumption. Who has how much money doesn’t really matter - instead, when government implements another policy (tax or monetary) and/or creates more money, we should be asking: who will consume more and who will consume less.

The Government taxes and makes spending bills.
But you gotta ask yourself this very important question, if you believe the Government can simply make the money it needs, why does it need our money at all then?

>And sometimes it s not an easy answer (example: if government jacks up tax on “rich” to implement more social programs, it s not the rich who will consume less)

The right to do business is one of the most sacred rights under Libertarianism. 

A major theme of Biden's speech was the Green New Deal, heavy taxation and ""the government creates prosperity.""  The government just can't create prosperity.  The government can tax and print money- but it can't create prosperity like the free market can.  

The ""Green New Deal"" and infrastructure bills are designed to get as many people working for the government instead of the private sector as possible.  There were a lot of blue collar workers working in government factories in the Soviet Union, they just didn't create prosperity. 

It's pretty obvious that the Biden administration takes a lot of inspiration from Marxism.  The Biden administration is big into unionization, he said ""unions created the middle class,"" but said nothing about the factories and businesses who pay those unions.  It seems like he he wants every city to be run like Detroit.  I don't like the ""Protecting the Right to Organize Act,""  it takes away the rights of businesses to do what is best for the running of the business. 

> By the way – let’s also pass the $15 minimum wage. No one should work 40 hours a week and still live below the poverty line. And we need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. Let’s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk for equal pay. It’s long past time.

Libertarian,comment,mortgage,kjeqtds,cluskillz,,"> towns that I knew would rapidly appreciate the value of my real estate

If this is the case, you left money on the table by not utilizing mortgages. During the period which you highlighted, mortgage rates were around 2.5 to 3.5%. S&P500 gains average somewhere along 6-8%; much higher during that time period. Leveraging your money with mortgages means you could have used that debt money to put in an investment vehicle that outstrips the interest that you'd have to pay. You could also have bought more equity (whether larger homes or just more homes) in an appreciating market environment, meaning you lost out of home value appreciation. Additionally, you can write off interest on taxes, so you missed out on that as well. What you did gain was a decreased amount of risk, which in those stated years, probably was not terribly high (for market environment, anyway).

I have three mortgages. The latest one probably wasn't a great financial move, but it was needed for family reasons, and we can afford it. The two early mortgages I have no plans to pay it down early, especially when even savings rates outstrip the interest I have to pay on it. If I didn't utilize debt for those first two mortgages, I would be in worse financial position today. Debt is a good tool to utilize if you're financially responsible. If not, debt is a good tool for bashing your own head in with. But a lot of people think debt is *only* a negative, and that's just not true.

That said, is it fair that mortgages are so damned lucrative for those in society that are better off? Hell, no. This is why the Fed needs to be abolished so the better off can no longer leverage their money at artificially suppressed rates on the backs of the devaluing of currency (which hurts the poor far more than the rich and politically connected).",2024-01-24T21:46:30+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

I don't think there is any realistic way to get India, China, etc. to stop emitting carbon. People in Africa aren't going to just shrug and decide to live in poverty. They're going to want economic development as well and they won't be deterred by the threat of global warming.

Libertarian,comment,property,i9j8u79,SouthernShao,,"The only laws I'm in favor of are laws that protect negative rights.

You have to remember that every single law is, at the very end of that proverbial road, something that must be enforced by threat of death.

Imagine a simple parking ticket. Imagine you get a $100 fine and you just refuse to pay. Does the state simply throw its hands in the air and declare they tried their best? Of course not. So what's the penalty for refusing to pay that $100 fine? Well, possibly another, much bigger fine.

So let's say you don't pay that fine either. Now what? Well, now the state sends enforcers to you with the intent of claiming you and physically placing you in a cage. If your neighbor tried to do this, would you defend yourself? You would likely defend yourself. Your neighbor Joe is no different than officer Dave - they're both just other human beings, and both want to throw you in a cage.

So you resist. Now what do you think happens? Do the police just throw their hands in the air and say they tried? Of course not. They keep trying to use force against you until they either succeed in apprehending you to violently place you in a cage against your will, or they kill you. There is no alternative.

The state will never stop - it can't. If it doesn't fine you then it can't fine me. It can't play some kind of special favorite with one of us when we both violate the law. It MUST uphold the law, else the law doesn't exist. A law is only a law when it manifests the essence of what a law is in the real world, and the essence of what manifests a law as say, independent of a request, is that a law is a request of which is enforced through violence. If you do not enforce a law through violence then it isn't a law. You can CALL it a law, but it isn't a law.

IF the law exists, it must be enforced, and that means the punishment MUST be carried out. IF the individual breaking that law refuses to accept the punishment, it must be FORCED upon them. You cannot even let a parking violation slide, else you need to stop having parking violations entirely. It's binary - either parking violations are against the law, or they aren't. You can't have it both ways.

If you're not willing to kill someone for breaking a law then that probably shouldn't be a law.",2022-05-22T05:49:02+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Second, in order to not blow the budget, care must be rationed in some manner. Every government-run healthcare system around the world rations care to control costs. In Great Britain, the National Institute on Clinical Effectiveness makes such decisions, including a controversial determination that certain cancer drugs are “too expensive.” The government effectively puts a price tag on each citizen’s life—some $44,305 per year, to be exact. That’s just a baseline, of course, and, as the British Institute’s chairman, Michael Rawlins, points out, the agency has at times approved treatments costing as much as $70,887 per year of extended life. But these are approved only if it can be shown they extend life by at least three months and are used for illnesses that affect fewer than 7,000 new patients per year.

However, the comparison is often between a single payer system and the U.S. system. The U.S. system has been called a Mercantilist system and really is little better or different than single-payer systems. Due to the system's perverse incentives, much cost-effective care is squeezed out, resources are increasingly allocated to costly, inefficient and opaque administrative and regulatory procedures and central organizational overgrowth with un-necessary and inefficient micro-management of physicians rather than medical need.

The system wastes money on unnecessary premium care workups for all patients, and inappropriate use of expensive technology. Other inefficiencies include information failures, inefficient moral hazard issues, adverse selection, distorted incentives, inflated hospital and pharmaceutical pricing and cost shifting. Many attainable efficiencies are not achieved. We also use medicines and technologies that cost a lot for little or no marginal health benefit. Administrative expenses are high, and enormous sums are squandered in efforts to game the system. Given the mercantile emphasis on production and the ignored consumer it is no wonder that between one fifth and one third of medical outlays do nothing to improve health.

Single payer systems, through rationing of care, actually can force more efficiency because providers know they are limited. The U.S. system basically has no limits and care providers can expend resources to any extent they wish.

At the time same health outcomes in the United States are far better than those of single payer nations. 

For example, life expectancies are affected by exogenous factors such as violent crime, poverty, obesity, tobacco and drug use, and other issues unrelated to health care. As the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development explains, “It is difficult to estimate the relative contribution of the numerous nonmedical and medical factors that might affect variations in life expectancy across countries and over time.”

Similarly, infant mortality, a common measure in cross-country comparisons, is highly problematic. In the United States, very low birth-weight infants have a much greater chance of being brought to term with the latest medical technologies. Some of those low birth-weight babies die soon after birth, which boosts our infant mortality rate, but in many other Western countries, those high-risk, low birth-weight infants are not included when infant mortality is calculated.

When you compare the outcomes for specific diseases, the United States clearly outperforms the rest of the world. Whether the disease is cancer, pneumonia, heart disease, or AIDS, the chances of a patient surviving are far higher in the United States than in other countries. 

Moreover, the United States drives much of the innovation and research on health care worldwide. Eighteen of the last 25 winners of the Nobel Prize in Medicine are either U.S. citizens or individuals working here. U.S. companies have developed half of all new major medicines introduced worldwide over the past 30 years. In fact, Americans played a key role in 80 percent of the most important medical advances of the past few decades. Advanced medical technology is far more available in the United States than in nearly any other country.

Health and medicine present unique challenges but non-coercive measures are best able to address these challenges. A comprehensive functional market-based system is far better positioned to match resources without price controls or rationing care.",2024-03-30T12:32:13+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

This argument is overused and old, but I'll bite.

And I'm the tyrant if I don't get off your island. Technically nature is the tyrant, nature in this instance simply implying anything that isn't controlled by way of human action. The natural laws of the universe, as well as just plain dumb luck aren't your fault nor your problem.

Now are you an immoral asshole by way of my subjective defining of your character? Oh absolutely, and would I likely use force against you to survive? Most assuredly, but that still makes me an aggressor and in the wrong, from an objectively moral perspective.

>Just two people on an island and your version of libertarianism no longer works. Can it be that fragile?

It works perfectly - that's literally the way it's supposed to work. The coincidental byproduct of human decisions isn't ""libertarianism"", the potential for those choices to be made in the first place, is.

You completely misunderstand the entire underlining paradigms here. ALL there can EVER be are humans who control property. All you can ever do is flex force in a way in which property is either taken to be controlled, or protected so as to maintain control. All you can ever do is shift around who has exclusive authority over that property.

So imagine in your little scenario I happen to represent the government and I mandate that you simply cannot own the entire island, so I manage to imprison you in a steel cage dropped off by way of helicopter (that I radioed in, because being government, I have infinite resources compared to you, and you will fundamentally never beat me, because even if you killed me, I merely REPRESENT government - more officials will be by shortly to apprehend you and destroy your entire life for killing me even though I clearly trespassed on your property).

In fact, I could just mandate that you own none of the island even though for the sake of this argument nobody else even knew this island ever existed. This is just one prospect you're completely missing here.

And the irony is that in your scenario, your WILL is in fact to own ALL OF THE ISLAND. By way of your own construct here you're creating an internal paradox, because your argument is that it's unfair of you to claim the entire island, and yet, in your very own scenario your WILL is in fact to claim the entire island - you're creating a hypothetical that is in its very design contradictory.

Do you think it's unfair of you to claim the whole island for yourself? Or do you believe it should be force-shared? Because if you believe it should be force-shared, then you wouldn't claim the entire island for yourself. Surely you understand at least some of this.

And IF you actually want the entire island for yourself, then your entire argument is moot by simply way of the fact that you do not want the government, or anybody else for that matter, to circumvent your authority over it. ***You cannot desire the circumvention of your own will***.

Your entire line of thinking is contradictory. Do you think it's fair or unfair to own that entire island? If you think it's fair then you don't want anyone else circumventing that desire, and if you think it's unfair, then you never would have ""claimed"" it in the first place.

And your argument of a system of liberty falling apart by way of its fragility is nonsensical. It asserts that if Dave and Joe are both stranded on that island and Joe got there first and claimed it all to himself, that Dave is forced to die. Alright, fair enough (if he didn't want to act immorally, anyway). But what you espouse with that by way of implication is that if Joe was government and made that exact same system and codified it into law, that somehow that changes everything.

All there can EVER BE is Dave and Joe. There is no government. Government is an abstract idea. It's helpful to describe complex systems, but government can't do anything, only people can. Government doesn't make rules or laws or mandates, or initiate social programs or anything else, people do.

So to assert that Dave and Joe can't be trusted to choose their own life choices but Dave and Joe can so long as one of them is government is absolute nonsense. You don't even know what you're talking about.

In a state of liberty we simply get to do whatever we want barring that doing so does not initiate actions of which circumvent the will of our fellow man. That's it. The difference between this and authoritarianism (tyranny) is that in a state of tyranny, the tyrants can (and will) simply initiate actions of which do what you don't want them to do, such as take your property, kill people who did nothing wrong, or pass laws that you'd never want passed.

Every time people learn that you're a libertarian, they say ""have you played Bioshock? That game shows why a libertarian society is impossible"".

So I played it. Spoilers for a game that is like 20 years old or something like that.

The story goes about some billionaire dude named Ayn Rando who builds Rapture, a city in the bottom of the ocean in order to create a libertarian utopia: no government regulation, no taxes, drugs allowed, etc. The state (in this case, Rando) keeps the peace via some menacing flying drones with machine guns, and does the necessary repairs to keep the city's infrastructure going, via some big guys in diving suits called big daddies. The big daddies also protect some creepy children called Little Sisters, who harvest corpses (what did they harvest in the times the city was thriving and there weren't no corpses around?) to get a substance called ADAM. ADAM gives you the ability to gain a lot of cool mutations and powers, but eventually turns you into a demented anarcho capitalist with hooks for hands or something. Eventually it's revealed that our friend and guide, the cool, shoulder-shrugging Atlas, is actually the crime lord Fountain Heado, a man who accumulated so much power and money that he unsuccessfully tried to overthrow Ayn Rando, who tried to get him imprisoned, but he escaped and turned into Atlas.

The game has it's own wiki, so you can look at it if you need more info. Or just play the game, it's really fun.

Now, about the philosophy within.

I really don't know if this game's message about libertarianism is done in good faith, wanting to show traits the game's creators found to be negative in libertarianism, or if those creators just didn't like libertarianism, so they created a world where a self-proclaimed libertarian builds a libertarian city and it fails because the plot says it fails. Say in XVIII century france, some absolutism-leaning writer, to respond to the growing anti monarchist ideas, writes a book called Democrazyness. There, in a country, the people kills the king and create a government ruled by the majority vote. They elect a president called Evilio McReallyEvilGuy, who then decides to give citizenship to dogs, and then the dogs, wanting to have a dog elected as the next president, devour all the human babies in order to reduce human population in the future. There's a civil war between dogs and people, and the country collapses and everyone dies. Moral of the story: not having an autocratic, god-chosen leader is impossible, you shouldn't even try.

This stupid story, as you can see, is written in bad faith; it doesn't really talk to us about the possible risks of getting rid of autocratic monarchy, but about the author's bias towards the subject. I see the same in the case of Bioshock. If you want to tell a story about why libertarianism would fail when applied to a maximum degree, then do it. Maybe some people who are less smart or less willing to put elbow grease into their own progress, and therefore are less successful try to create some form of socialism or something like that. I don't know, talk about the real challenges such a utopia would face.

But Bioshock doesn't do this. Rapture is a terrible place, but not because libertarian ideas have made everything go out of control, but because the system isn't libertarian at all. Here some evidences of this:

1. Ryan isn't as interested in every person exploring and setting their own rules as he is in imposing his own rules over the people of Rapture. Every space in the city has his name or initials written in some place. This is Ryan's city and he wants you to know that.

2. Talking against Ryan or mocking him is forbidden. Censorship is absolutely the opposite from libertarianism, where people could and should say whatever they want with no repercussions.

3. The worst crime is... Smuggling? How do the crime of smuggling even exist, if there's no taxation and every interchange between agreeing parts should be a fundamental right? Again there's no real freedom at all from the very start. Not very libertarian.

4. Practicing religion and owning religious artifacts is forbidden? Come on, that's not libertarian, that's fucking communism! My freedom includes my right to freely worship ~~my wife~~ whoever I want.

5. People are regularly used as guinea pigs for experiment against their will by scientists and other madmen. Practically the only role a libertarian state should have is protecting private property, which includes the body, the first private possession you own. So putting the choice of ""would you kill someone else if your own accomplishment is the prize?"" Hell no. That's fundamentally not libertarianism. Libertarians don't grow at other people's expenses.

6. Ryan considered Fontaine's charity towards the poor like heresy. Why? Nobody should be able to tell anybody what to do with their own resources. If Fontaine wants to give his money to the Salvation Army or open a soup kitchen, as long as he does it with his own private funds, it should be okay.

There are some more items, but I don't want this to get too long. Let's only say that, after having played Bioshock, I don't think it's an accurate portrayal of libertarianism at all. Rapture has an authoritarian leader who is extremely conservative about his liberal ideas, and its failure was, if anything, because of Ryan's inability to actually leave people thrive by themselves, as a true libertarian would. For us libertarians, freedom is the point, even the freedom for the people to choose conservative or stupid ideas, as long as they don't harm somebody else. I'm writing this text mainly because I couldn't find one like it on the internet, and I think using Bioshock as a tool to understand libertarianism is not a very good idea.

I am a homelessness policy expert. That’s not a brag or anything just providing context that I actually know a lot about this issue. 

And you think 40 hours a week is tiring? Libertarians would say that you as an employee are entering freely into a contract with your employer so any labor protections like a minimum wage or the 40 hour work week would disappear. If you don’t like it, you are free to choose to starve or die of a preventable illness! Before the government stepped in people working 12 hour days (or more), 7 days a week, in dangerous working conditions with minimal pay was the norm. It was great if you owned a factory, but if you worked in one it was not an ideal life. 

There would be more homelessness and crime, but it would be confined to areas where rich people didn’t have private security forcing them out. So if you are rich it would probably be an improvement. You would not have to see homeless people in your privately controlled rich people enclaves, but for the rest of us it would be pretty bad. 

Look, I know I’m in the Libertarian sub. I am expecting downvotes. But I just want to highlight some issues that I think Libertarians just brush off. Oh if we didn’t have taxes then everything would somehow work itself out! 50% of this country does not pay income taxes because they make too little money. How does cutting taxes on other people and getting rid of social safety net programs help those people? It doesn’t. In a more Libertarian society those people would live in shanty towns like they do in other countries. But there would be more homeless people and crime would be significantly worse (because crime is correlated to poverty). More people would starve on the streets, which is something you seem concerned with. 

For the record, I lean Libertarian on some issues, like legalization of (most) drugs and definitely in regards to local zoning regulations. Fuck minimum lot sizes, height and setback restrictions, and parking minimums. 

I also think there are some areas where the market intervention by the government has been significantly bad - we subsidize oil and gas companies with around $50-60 billion per year (which by the way would be enough funding to effectively end homelessness in America). 

Imagine a world where we were paying the real price of gas at the pump for the past 60 years. There would have been a lot more market demand for electric vehicles, smaller cars, public transportation, etc.",2023-12-12T18:39:25+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Libertarian,comment,welfare,gv6ds4w,AnarchistBorganism,,"""Personal responsibility"" is treated as an ideal that should be strived for, i.e. people should be responsible for whether or not they are in poverty, but right-wingers treat it as a statement of fact that people are responsible for whether or not they are in poverty. In either case, the motivation behind it is typically authoritarian, and not libertarian.

In the first case, there is generally a belief about how a person should behave based on an ideal of maximizing productivity, with the assumption that the capitalist system rewards behavior that is productive and punishes behavior that is unproductive. In the latter case, there is an assumption that the existing system is just, and does justly reward and punish people for their productive and unproductive behavior. In either case, there is no attempt to examine the power that people actually have or can have under capitalism (which power and responsibility go hand in hand), and there is no attempt to examine the psychology of humans to even determine whether people are realistically capable of conforming to their ideal.

A UBI can be justified on libertarian grounds, because it can recognize that the power structures don't give everyone the capacity to escape poverty. It can also be justified on the grounds that we cannot or should not expect everyone to conform to the ideals of capitalist ideologues.",2021-04-20T07:10:11+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

People shouldn't die or go bankrupt because of hospital bills. I do also agree that taxes should be lowered, but I also believe that billionaires should be paying their fair share (ie. a higher tax rate than the average citizen, money for social infrastructure has to come from somewhere). Or, in the ideal socialist society, the workers would own the means of production which would in turn net them a much higher salary (NOT to be confused with taxes, because true socialism has nothing to do with raising taxes).",2021-12-14T07:37:39+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

The court’s three liberals dissented.

Legal challenges to the law are ongoing at a federal appeals court.

The court had been blocking the law from taking effect, issuing an indefinite stay on Monday, which was wiped away by Tuesday’s order.

The decision hands a significant – yet temporary – win to Texas, which has been in an ongoing legal battle with the Biden administration over immigration policy.

Please tell me what “broadly applicable” skills I obtained by being forced to take the college-level equivalent of gym class that I didn’t already obtain from elementary through high school? What skills did I obtain being forced to take an English lit class I had zero interest in that I didn’t already obtain in AP English?

You’re talking in vague generalities because you have no actually utility you can point to. Like why are you defending institutions that waste the time and money of young people by forcing them to pay for classes they don’t want to take? All of this costs money and time.

>	doing essays and analyses about the social context surrounding the city of Athens in the 5th century is useless but trains your communication and critical thinking skills.

But to what extent? What is the value add of doing this at a college level vs at the high school level? What is the value add of making people who actively *don’t* want to do it, do it? College is not compulsory like primary education, people are paying directly for this time and instruction that is not useful to them.

>	Of course, you’re too STEMbrained to see that.

Neoliberal,comment,deduct,gnpb4mo,kfh392,,"I respectfully disagree with each of your points, though I certainly recognize that several of them have merit and see where you're coming from.

>The reason why I want them to keep them around is that I'm worried that it would get underfunded and Republicans have a history of doing that with benefits. It will easier for them to restrict abortions under a single-payer system. Also, a lot of single-payer systems are under the state level or local which easier for the Red States to underfunded it. 

I submit that the women who need abortions and cannot afford them are having a MUCH harder time under the current system, and the public option proposed by Biden would be EASIER for Republicans to restrict benefits due to its lack of universality and inevitable status as health insurance for the working poor that aren't poor enough for medicaid.

>Not only that but America has a history of racial issues. Australia has the public option but they heavily ignore minorities and Rural areas. This is will be a bigger problem in the USA. The majority of people who take advantage are the white upper class and abused it.

Strongly disagree.  Under a single payer system, benefits would be the same for Jeff Bezos and a poor black woman in Alabama.  Now, Bezos could pay cash for more bells and whistles or purchase a private plan that gives him the same, but the baseline benefits would have to be good enough to keep generally well off people satisfied with their coverage, and every single payer proposal has included benefits that would absolutely accomplish that goal.

>Also, the single-payer system has long wait lines and private insurance doesn't have that problem.

Study after study of Canada's single payer system has shown that this concern is overblown.  More fundamentally, the only reason we don't have longer wait times now is that *people who need care don't seek treatment because of cost concerns.*  Importantly, that includes people who have employer provided insurance plans.  I'll gesture vaguely toward the benefits of preventive treatments over emergency care and trust that you get my point.

If the only benefit provided by health insurance carriers is that they're not the government, I think that hardly justifies the administrative bloat intrinsic to their existence.",2021-02-16T23:15:36+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Neoliberal,post,deficit,txm8h0,transubstantiator,I'm trying to understand the endgame of 90s-era Clintonomics/Blairism neoliberal policy and its vision for achieving local/global prosperity (before everything was destroyed by the era of neocons and Islamophobia),"I realize it wasn't a completely uniform zeitgeist, but from what I gather the essential components seemed to be:

1. Demilitarization and overall spending cuts for the sake of eliminating massive deficits/debts, so Gen X/Y wouldn't shoulder the burden of supporting massive numbers of Boomers as they left the workforce
2. Using ""soft power"" and free trade to help fulfill the vision of ""The End of History"" (the inevitability of the world accepting free market liberal democracy was the only truly viable form of governance, after the collapse of the Soviet Union)
3. Eliminating most welfare programs and limiting immigration to push impoverished people into the workforce, while also ensuring those jobs paid something closer to a first-world standard living wage (via a combination of low inflation secured by deficit/debt reductions, minimum wage increases, targeted tax cuts, and means-tested tax credits)
4. Creating special Westernized economic zones in developing countries and near borders between poorer and wealthier countries (which migrants could be drawn into instead of actually crossing over). Accepting some degree of exploitation would occur, but that having those jobs was beneficial overall, and trade incentives could be used to enforce some degree of regulation and improved working conditions
5. Overall, on a grander level, a reliance on the idea that investments in technology and infrastructure would slowly and incrementally bring us to a ""Star Trek"" future (if balanced with investments in environmental protections and preventing climate change). That given enough time and stability, tech would advance to the point the Earth was capable of giving everybody a decent standard of living, in a manner which could spread across the globe after liberal democracy was accepted as the only way forward and nothing impeded the flow of free markets across the entire planet

I'd like to hear any feedback on what I'm missing, what I have wrong, etc. Also, I'm interested in hearing what contemporary neoliberals see as inherent flaws in the 90s-era vision (ie, why it wouldn't have worked even if various sociopolitical forces hadn't kneecapped its proponents and architects)",2022-04-06T13:30:32+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Look at Canada as an example of what we should be doing regulatory wise. I also think we need to increase some of our limits on allowed doses and radiation releases. The USA has the most restrictive rules in the world for this (even compared to Europe and Canada) and there is no science supporting these cost increasing limits.

Neoliberal,comment,income,jq2kyx8,Fire_Snatcher,,"I think you made a case for affirmative action largely, though not entirely, based on its legal foundation. However, I don't know to what extent most people on r/Neoliberal or the general public are defending the outcome, or predicted consequences, of this ruling based on the strength of its legal foundation nor how much they really care.

I think the question over affirmative action is a tough one for a lot of Americans because there is the strong belief that education is meant to be the great equalizer. I've heard that all the time since moving to the US, and a lot of people want that equalizer to be applied in a manner they deem fair. To a lot of people, especially for the Asian community as the Pew Poll you linked showed believe that someone proves their worth through GPA, SAT, and community service. However, college admissions officers proudly declare they reject many people with 4.0 (unweighted) GPA and 1600 SAT.

To them, there is a real question of what are we valuing in admissions (sports, legacy, triumph through adversity, ""personality"", cultural fit) especially when tax dollars flow, through many channels, into universities? What do we afford our greatest academic minds? What stability is promised to those who demonstrate achievement academically? How can I ensure that admissions don't seem like such a crapshoot?

I think those are super fair questions (especially when you are funding part of this system) that have to be balanced with the idea that most people recognize that there are groups of people who did not have a lot of resources but what they did achieve was impressive and the educational system should give them a boost when viewing them holistically. I think almost everyone shares this desire to have some measure of predictability with an understanding that you have to view people within the context they come from.

For me the only thing I really see that can satisfy both may be for all universities to have transparently two-tiered admissions system where the first tier is anyone with these academic accomplishments is allowed in (and that should form a large part of the student body), and then a second tier that may be more like today's admissions' standards. That way there is a balance of predictable access to this resource with some understanding of the complexity of humans and what they have to offer the world beyond just academic excellence.",2023-06-30T01:07:37+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Contrast that with an example from Louis Rossman's MacBook repair business. If you drop off your computer and ghost them for two years it's abandoned property, and he gets to re-sell it. But NYC has a specific regulation that you have to register computers you buy off random people so that they can track muggings. Do you have to enter the abandoned machines onto the LEADS online database?

Because they didn't know. The cops not only did not know the law, they couldn't simply tell him they were gonna call legal and get back to him.

The Danes would have been able to get him an answer, and if his business was gonna get screwed by this stupid technicality likely would have simply had the politicians grant him some sort of clemency.

This is an outdated understanding of labour markets.

Again, this is a market failure. Monopsony power pervades in retail, healthcare and administration, but not in manufacturing and the auto industry which are heavily unionized. Why? *Because unions drive wages closer to what they would be in a competitive model.*

Neoliberal,post,student loans,ri4gcx,Kross_B,Is Biden facing an doomed battle to win re-election in 2024?,"At the moment, it seems difficult to look at the news and not conclude that Biden has no chance of winning in 2024. The chaotic and bloody withdrawal from Afghanistan shattered his reputation as a competent and capable pair of hands. Voters, particularly independents, are souring on him over inflation and Covid, which little signs of abating anytime soon. The more progressive elements of the Democratic Party are showing discontent over Biden’s landmark social spending bill and other legislation such as voting rights and climate change being unable to pass due to opposition by the more conservative elements of the party. Support for Biden among young voters, a key pillar of the Democrats coalition has also dropped massively, and unlikely to improve given Biden seemingly balking on promises to forgive student loan debt. And all polling thus far indicates the Republicans winning Congress in the 2022 midterm elections in a landslide, preventing the Democrats from getting anything done except for executive orders. Much has also been said about how poor the Democrats are at messaging compared to their opposition. I’ve seen at least a few draw parallels between Biden and Carter’s presidency and how the latter’s unpopularity led to Reagan’s landslide victory in 1980.

As such, Democrats fear/Republicans hope that Biden will be entering his re-election in 2024 as an enormous underdog with no chance of winning. No incumbency advantage due to deep and engrained unpopularity over Afghanistan/Inflaiton/Covid, lack of political achievements or “wins” to point to in making a case for a new mandate, and an apathetic Democrat base that concludes their party failed to do anything, causing weak turnout. While Trump, DeSantis or whoever the Republicans nominate will be not just the odds-on, but a guaranteed favourite to win with lots of momentum thanks to the always energised Republican base, plus the structural advantage of the Electoral College favouring the GOP.

Now, some do argue its far too early to count Biden out. Every president faces a drop in approval following their honeymoon period, and midterm elections in the the U.S. tend to see the incumbent part lose seats, only to bounce back in the presidential race. But others feel Biden simply isn’t an effective enough politician like Reagan, Clinton and Obama to mount an post-midterm rebound. And that even if inflation improves, and Covid finally settles down to a tolerable endemic state, the Dems poor messaging will ensure theirs and Biden’s approval remains permanently underwater, guaranteeing GOP victory in 2022 and 2024.

With all that said, do you believe Biden can still bounce back and win re-election in 2024? And if so, why do you believe that can still happen given everything else.",2021-12-17T00:30:30+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

We can't verify the veracity of academic/exam records from e.g. China, the way we can with records. I do business in China. The entire place is corrupt and runs on bribes -top to bottom. When a tycoon or party official wants to send their dingleberry kid to a US college, they make it happen and (unlike domestic students) it can never catch up to them.

The result is unqualified international students in difficult degree programs forming *huge* WeChat cheating rings. In my graduate CS courses the international students couldn't even get Hello World to compile. My friends who went on to teach at University say that the problem has only gotten worse in the decades since, but they're not allowed to address it. 

There are also instances of US college admissions staff getting busted for accepting bribes to let hundreds of unqualified Chinese international students through the admissions interviews.

What do you think would happen if we just took US students at their word about their grades and test scores? People follow their incentives, and when you create perverse incentives you get degenerate results.

At least in the rare instance when a domestic admissions bribery ring is discovered we weren't educating somebody who was going to ply their skills for the CCP. We can actually discover that fake domestic records are fake. College professors can take action against those students for cheating or just generally being awful. We can put people in jail.

Neoliberal,post,subsidizing,1bjtqcc,John3262005,"Freedom Caucus members push to cut off ""morally dubious"" expanded IVF access for veterans","A group of right-wing House Freedom Caucus members on Wednesday sent a letter to the Department of Veterans Affairs opposing the agency's recent expansion of in vitro fertilization access.

Several Republican lawmakers have gotten behind a GOP resolution declaring support for IVF, while one even signed onto a Democratic bill to create federal protections for fertility services.

At issue is the the VA's announcement last week that it will provide IVF services to unmarried veterans and those in same-sex marriages, as well as those who cannot create their own sperm or eggs.

Four Freedom Caucus members, led by Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.), wrote in a letter to VA Secretary Denis McDonough that they have ""strong objections"" to the new policy.

""IVF is morally dubious and should not be subsidized by the American taxpayer,"" they continued, echoing opposition from anti-abortion groups to the creation of ""surplus"" embryos as part of the IVF process. The letter includes a list of questions for McDonough about the storage and treatment of surplus embryos and the cost and legality of the policy.

In addition to Rosendale, the letter was signed by Reps. Mary Miller (R-Ill.), Josh Brecheen (R-Okla.) and Bob Good (R-Va.), the chair of the Freedom Caucus.

The lawmakers wrote that it would ""make more sense"" to use the funds for the IVF policy tot ""bolster adoption efforts"" instead.

A VA spokesperson told Axios that, by law, the department's policy must adhere to that of the Pentagon, which similarly expanded IVF access. The spokesperson added that the VA only covers the freezing of embryos but does not destroy them. In the event of divorce or death. Disposal is a choice for the veteran or their family.

Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.), who introduced the Democratic bill to create federal protections for IVF, told Axios of the letter, simply, ""Unbelievable.""",2024-03-21T00:49:07+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

There are definitely other factors, and the minimum wage - unemployment relationship may not be the same for every country.

The unemployment situation seems very different in France and Austria, though. For us, 7% is the lowest rate in 41 years. While Austria had [unemployment below 5%  as recently as 2011](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/AUT/austria/unemployment-rate#:~:text=Unemployment%20refers%20to%20the%20share,a%200.94%25%20increase%20from%202020.) . So, to explain the situation in France, I'll tend to look at our long-term characteristics (and our min wage / median wage ratio has been high for a long time). Whatever causes the high unemployment in Austria seems recent, it might be a shock (could it be covid-related?) or recent policy changes.

And, while Austria doesn't have a national minimum wage, my understanding is that many sectors are covered by agreements setting minimum wages. [This article](https://wageindicator.org/salary/minimum-wage/austria) even says all sectors have a minimum wage of 1500€ since 2020? Minimum wages would have the same effect, whether they are set by national governments or collective agreements (the latter just makes comparisons harder).",2023-03-26T19:04:02+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

However, the fact that the law was written only about 50 years ago means you can't really argue based on some archaic interpretation.

I have to say this is one of my favorite topics. Because I think. We have become way too indulgent in this view that parents are the be all and end all when it comes to raising children.  I have four children but while they are my children, they are also citizens, friends, students, colleagues, etc. that is to say I do not have a monopoly on who they are.

I personally am cynical enough to believe that this view is a spinoff of the idea of radical individualism. And I view radical individualism, as smokescreen for the wealthy and powerful to increase their wealth and power. That is, it is part of an attempt to make people less aware that they are part of a society and the community.

I also feel like I need to call out what I see is one of the greatest disservices. That is when parents are allowed to homeschool their children or send them to religious schools. If as an educated adult, you want to believe in bullshit, magic, hocus-pocus, that I suppose is your prerogative , but I view it as almost a form of child abuse to subject your child to that. 

While this is not completely unproblematic the French, especially during the revolution, you children as creatures of the state first and foremost. I think you by state you mean the community and society at large, I generally agree with that sentiment. So I have a huge issue with this absurd.

The Taliban was only in conflict with the US because the US invaded and drove out the Taliban.  Of course, from the US point of view, it was because the Taliban harbored Al Qaeda.  

Bin Laden was a personal friend of Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader in 2001, and Bin Laden had helped Omar consolidate control over most of the country.  The majority of Taliban leaders counseled giving Bin Laden up to the Americans, but Omar wouldn't do it (and so the Taliban were driven from the country).  

Normally, there would be efforts to reintegrate almost all the Taliban back into civic life, but the US didn't want to do that, so the taliban turned back to war in 2003.  Then Mullah Omar died, and then the US got Bin Laden.  So other than the US being there and fighting the Taliban, there was no real need for a further conflict. 

So the Taliban said ""look, we won't let Afghanistan be a base for international terrorists.  We get that made us a big target in 2001 and we don't want to repeat it.  So if that works for you, will you finally leave?""  And the US basically said ""ok.""",2023-03-28T21:11:45+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,allowance,k6ee11r,captain-burrito,,"> Why is it when people get wealthy, established, and start families they ALL gravitate to the suburbs (ran by Republicans?) 

Do you have evidence of that?  Suburbs are competitive in elections.  Plenty of suburbs are democrat ran.  The story of the last decade or so was democrats winning the wealthiest house districts.  It was also a story of them spilling out of the urban core into inner ring suburbs.

That's how dems in 2018 in TX & GA won 12 more seats in their state houses as the gerrymandering plus increasing immigration had caused the lines to blur.  What did TX republicans do when redistricting this decade?  They just shored up narrowing margins in their districts and ceded a bunch of suburban districts to democrats.  They dared not go balls to the wall and just wanted to keep what they had so they could prevent another blue wave plus further dem migration to suburbs from overwhelming them.

There's some poor, crime ridden, polluted, corrupt, drug infested republican controlled areas too.  We've literally seen some former blue states switch red that are in the doldrums that have not improved.  Some democrat policies in cities do indeed make crime worse.  Some republican rule makes corruption and pollution worse. I mean one party rule of both parties does lend itself to the former.  Outright removing environmental protections is going to make pollution worse.  

>Name one.

North Dakota republicans effectively disenfranchise native americans from voting by requiring voter IDs to have a standard residential address in a new rule change.  They rely on PO Boxes which made them ineligible to vote.  That lasted 2-3 cycles before they settled with courts as their aims had been achieved.  Their main goal seemed to be to topple Heidi Heitkamp from the US senate seat.  Native americans were part of her base.  In the event they didn't have to as she lost by 11% which native americans would not have saved her from.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,capitalism,djhatsd,georgiedawn,,"> what exactly are you proposing we do instead?

What we have to do is be fair. Most middle class families have their assets tied up in their houses. If we force people to move, society needs to cover their losses. It's only fair. Otherwise, you're asking families to just give up hundreds of thousands of dollars; no one will buy their old home b/c there's no jobs there. Goal is to help them restart their life with as minimal an impact as possible. So we would need to raise the federal tax rate by 5% for 4 years.

So here's the math. For example, there are about 10 million jobs in oil and coal. Say we cut 80% because it turns out we actually still need oil; our chemical industry depends on organocarbons. Assume 50% are rural, 50% urban. Urban people (the business side of oil rather than the extraction) don't need to relocate, so they find new jobs easily, but we give them each 3 months of salary (say 20K/yr). So for those people: 4M x 20K = $80B

Then for rural people (say coal miners), they each get money to cover their homes ($200K). Homes in rural areas are cheaper than in cities; median home price in North Dakota is 180K. Include a relocation expense (5K), plus one year's salary (about $50K for a miner) as well as up to 2 years of education (say $40K). Thus per job that is lost (assuming one miner per family, usually the dad): 200K+5K+40K+50K roughly 300K. So 4M x300K = 1.2 trillion.

Thus if we want to be solely fair, society would have to hand out $1.3 trillion dollars to gut the oil industry. Assume they don't all switch in one year, but over 4 years so we need to spend $325 B for job relocations. In 2017, the estimated tax revenue was about $6.5 trillion dollars. I know 5% of people are in the oil/gas industry, but I'm going to pretend that's immaterial b/c only 1% of all employed peole are switching from oil/gas to a different career every year. 

Thus, we need to raise federal tax brackets by 5% for 4 years to cover this transition. I probably overestimatd the amount of people that need to retrain, as not everyone in oil/gas is in a small town (I couldn't find stats on how many). If you are unwilling to pay an extra 5% of your salary to help someone who's job is displaced, you don't really have a right to say ""Life sucks. Too bad.""",2017-06-27T20:33:04+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

If there were a conservative solution to climate change, police brutality, healthcare, etc. I would at least be willing to hear it out. Instead, their response is always that the problem isn't real or that if it is there's nothing we can actually do about it. For example, I don't believe for a minute that the Republicans have any intention of replacing the ACA with anything that would help anyone who isn't an insurance company.

The non binding referendum allowed for the governor of Puerto Rico to create a seven person commission to determine what statehood would mean to Puerto Rico.

After the governor gets the commissions results he can formally request statehood, or he can decide to keep things the way they are.


Aka this is all moot until PR officially requests statehood, which they haven't done.

Hell the governor can decide that 53% yes vote isn't enough to request being a state.

The bigger issue IMO is the way the structure is set.

You should read the sources that you post. 

>Estimated Budgetary Impact of the Legislation
CBO and JCT estimate that enacting both pieces of legislation—H.R. 3590 and the reconciliation proposal—would produce a **net reduction in federal deficits of $143 billion** over the 2010–2019 period.

Your first link is not to the cost of the ACA, but to the amount by which it reduces the deficit over the 2010-2019 period. 

The second link talks about the total cost, so those figures $143B and $1.4T are not a like for like comparison. 

>CBO and JCT have **lowered their estimates** of **the net federal cost** of the ACA’s insurance coverage provisions—to $1.4 trillion over the next decade, about $100 billion less than estimated in February.

Note that the revision is pointing out that they are lowering their forecast of how much the ACA costs, 

>Relative to their previous projections made in February 2014, CBO and JCT now estimate that the ACA’s coverage provisions will result in lower net costs to the federal government: The agencies currently project a net cost of $36 billion for 2014, $5 billion less than the previous projection for the year; and $1,383 billion for the 2015–2024 period, $104 billion less than the previous projections (see the figure below).

You can see how for 2014, the original prediction of cost was $41B,  the updated cost $36B. 

What you are doing with those two sources is misleadingly comparing an estimate of the amount that the ACA saves the Federal Government, with a second estimate of what the total cost of the ACA is.",2018-11-02T21:04:10+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,earnings,hrxm54y,CartographerLumpy752,,"So what you’re describing is basically a parliamentary system here (not sure if you’re American or not and actually know how parliament works). While I wouldn’t be apposed to that, it would cause more trouble than it’s worth in the short term for a couple reasons. 

1) you are now requiring the US president to give up A LOT of governing authority and nobody really wants to give up power, be it a person or institution. Parliamentary systems developed over about 1000 years, slowly pulling power away from the Monarch, giving it to appointed or elected bodies. European presidents are on the same legal level as the British queen, just without the birthright and history. 

2) We would need to abolish, make drastic changes, or find a way to incorporate another constitutional body: The Senate. What would be their place in this? Could the house appoint this leader (The Speaker of the House is currently the closest thing we have to a Prime Minister) and the Senate confirm them? Do they have to vote as well? The House and Senate are legally considered co equal so totally removing them from this decision would not fly. We’d might also have to find another way to appoint this person because PMs are installed by the parliament and presidents by a national vote. Would this person be legally part of the executive or legislative branch? Are we changing the boundaries of the divisions in government?

3) As hinted before, we still have the EC which would no longer be necessary. The goal of the EC is to more or less require a broad consensus and not make the most powerful individual in US government a total popularity contest. Without that worry due to the lesser amount of power, the EC is now absolutely irrelevant and a popular vote would work better to find someone who can truly represent the people of the US.

4) lastly, you have to deal with the fact that Americans are highly conservative. Not in the political sense of the current Republican Party but in that we are adverse to change, doing things in baby steps. Completely rewriting the US constitution (which is what this would be) is not going to happen in current peaceful times, relatively speaking. Outside of a post WW2 Germany situation, it isn’t going to happen.

All in all, it would be a difficult and probably unattainable process in current times but I wouldn’t be against having the house appoint and the senate confirm the head of government. The president would still be the head of the military, have specific veto powers, and appoint Supreme Court justices but all the actually governing and passing laws would be up to the PM and congress

For democrats imo it would be wise to play defensively. Aside from a slim possibly in Texas(Ted Cruz isn’t the most popular), don’t spend alot of money on uphill races(like Indiana or Nebraska). Focus on protecting the senators in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, Montana, and Ohio(especially Ohio and Montana) while giving Gallego enough money to beat Sinema and Lake.  

As for talking points talk mainly about Abortion, healthcare(a plan to fix/reform it), project 2025(ESPECIALLY THIS BECAUSE THIS IS DISTURBING IMO), and marijuana. Avoid talking about guns as much as possible. 

Now for Republican strategist imo focus in on Montana and Ohio. Since it only takes one of those seats flipping to have the senate(since West Virginia is very likely going red without Manchin around). Aside from potential defensive spending a bit of money on Texas, be on the offense. Talk about the economy, inflation, government paralysis(that your party caused but don’t mention that part) and crime(aka blame Biden even if it’s not his fault).

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,income,gxps32l,TyphosTheD,,"Poverty is generally defined fiscally as earning above a certain wage, established as a minimum baseline for certain goods and services including housing, food, clothing, etc. based on the average costs.

Poverty can be defined colloquially as the kind of lifestyle you'd be embarrassed to learn of others living in.

It seems the way that you take poverty is somewhat limited, in my opinion, as living paycheck to paycheck effectively disallows any form of upward mobility - which I think is a fundamental crux of the issue of poverty. If someone cannot extricate themselves from poverty, if poverty is in most senses a permanent state rather than a temporary burden, it becomes a more impactful issue. Impoverished people are more susceptible to abuse from systemic issues that don't impact their more well-off peers, which creates sort of a downward or at least stagnant spiral that will eventually bring them below the poverty line.

With this established, I think coming to an answer is reasonably possible, which is yes, but with a significant caveat. I say this because given the right conditions and adequate resources poverty would be a temporary state of being, not a constant lifestyle bereft of upward mobility. If poverty is intended by your example to be a temporary condition, then in the long scheme of things eventually poverty would be eliminated. 

However this begs the question, because as poverty lowers, the standard and quality of life expectation raises, which necessarily raises the poverty line, so there will always be someone impoverished. So in short, we should expect a certain percentage of our people to be impoverished, but should also provide such benefits that enable folks to extricate themselves from poverty by raising the standard of living and the capability of everyone to afford it.",2021-05-11T11:10:55+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Basically, the world has changed, and things that were once able to be tolerated as necessary evils are no longer necessary, and just evil.

The IRS could send you a post card that just has a simple number, and give you the option of either paying that, or doing a tax form to add in deductions or other options, so tax forms could be made to be optional, or they could be eliminated altogether.

Unfortunately it seems like the predicted savings wouldn't be that significant.

Now personally I feel that it should be the minimum livable wage, however to achieve this we would need to just about rebuild the economy, we would need price ceilings on products, and stipulations to ensure companies only hire Americans and to make off shoring illegal. Unfortunately this would likely not work and would require far too much government interference in a capitalist economy, at that point we may as well switch to communism. Another thing that inflated well beyond the inflation of the USD is college tuition, decades ago you could pay for college completely via a part time minimum wage job, but now the boomers decided to treat Generation Xers and Millennials as a commodity or credit card by convincing then to severely indebt themselves to the government via college student loans, in essence to pay interest to cover the failing social security that exists in the general fund, but this is a whole other argument.

Most gun rights advocates I know believe, like I do, in the value of property rights.  Therefore, it follows that you have all the right in the world to wear your guns, *unless you're on my property and ask you not to.*  So, if Starbuck's doesn't allow guns, voice your displeasure by not drinking their overpriced lattes; don't fucking bring attention to yourselves so that people who would love nothing more than to restrict gun ownership can use you for political fodder.

If you want to protest in public space, fine.  You want to bring your guns to that protest; I think it's over the top, but fine.  But, goddamnit, barging into someone's *private business* with firearms when they explicitly state that you can't have them is crossing the line.

Anyway, I realize that this is more of a rant than a question, but I'll throw this out there.  Is there something I'm missing here?  Is there some reason that protest involving firearms somehow trumps property rights?

Yes. It matters a great deal. Sales taxes, European VATS, Payroll taxes, and 'traditional' taxes on profit attempt to capture these various stages of production & profit. R & D, generally, is not taxed.

So my solution would simply be to penalize ""offshoring"" of capital which hasn't been used after a year, maybe 18 months. You can use tax havens to ""save"" for budgeted expenditures, you can reallocate resources to a new market without being taxed multiple times, but you can't use them as literal tax havens.

You are just wrong on this.  First ""income other than savings"" is a silly statement -- savings is a form of income.   Second, the elderly tend to have houses that are paid off, and lower taxes.  For the vast majority of Americans, those are the two major expenses.

Check the stats: the elderly are the richest, the young are the poorest.   This is not controversial.

The idea that Democrats are the ones who need to play defense on abortion as an issue post-Dobbs is ridiculous and not at all in tune with the current political environment. 

To put it in simple terms, there is a reason support for 15-week bans have dropped since Dobbs and that support for no limits on abortions have increased.

We as a society set goals: We want clean water, bridges that don't fail, hopsitals that offer top rate service.  They aren't a ""right"" it's simply a baseline we as a society set.  Doing the math, employers can afford it or we as a society can afford it via taxes.  I mean we are talking about 1% of an employees career if we average 3 months over 45 years and the fact that we as a society are having 1.7 children per woman.  There's ample proof that other societies afford it.   


So it's not really a matter of if we can do it, but a matter of do we want it as a society.   Now on your first point of ""I have to do the work of two people"".  In europe and Canada it was usually used as a time to hire people on contract as a way of evaluating them before hiring long term, or a way for people to trial new positions (doing your bosses job etc). These effects were considered pro employee and employer and seem to be enjoyed by both sides of the equation.    


Do they ""earn"" it.  No, in the same way that people who go on disability didn't earn it. It's called family medical leave. Having a baby pushed out of you is not a leasurely activity and it can take weeks to heal.  The time is there to stablize, adjust etc during a time when you will probably get the least sleep in your life.  Sure you can work right after that, but it leads to worse infant outcomes for both the parents and child.  If the employee was a forklift driver or airplane pilot why would you want them coming in fatigued, unrested and bleary eyed? I mean that's not even a sound company position.  


It's not a free vacation it's recovery and bonding during the most critical and dangerous part of your life; when you're born.

So really it just goes down to whether you have enough compassion for newborns and parents to decide that as a society we want to give them time to rest. It's demonstrated we can afford it, so it's just a matter as whether it's a goal.  I for one encourage it and offer it at my company. Not as a trick or to lure better workers. It's just the right thing to do. I also experienced it when my first son was born I got exactly 1 day off and will always regret not being able to spend more time because we were a single income family and I had to work.

How does one earn these revenues? Wait until the obligation is gone and keep any remaining money you haven't paid out to the person you owed the obligation to. For Social Security essentially, the person dies before they collect what they paid in. That's when you can recognize the revenue. You can't recognize revenue before that because you don't know if they will live longer and take more than they paid in. If they take more than they paid it, not only will you not have ANY revenue, you will have an expenditure!

Not really for a few reasons, but these are good questions.

1. Not all loans will be repaid.  Making a loan is a risk, and the risk is that the money will not be returned.  For some amount of borrowers, that will be true.
2. Inflation.  Money is worth less each year.  On a good year, it's worth 2-3% less than the previous year.  On a bad year (2022), it can be worth 8% less.  So while the nominal amount is returned, the value of that amount is a loss.
3. Opportunity cost.  Everytime you spend money on one thing, you don't spend it on something else.  If I buy $100 in cigars each month instead of putting my money in an IRA, then the true cost is not only the $100 but also the amount I could have earned by putting it the IRA.

Really student loans are a solid bargain for borrowers.  When you factor in low inflation rates, the real return on a loan to the federal government is closer to 3%.

basically the argument comes down to 
do you think it is bette rto have huge protions of a populace not participating in the economic consumer suystem of a country becuase they must toil at substenance jobs or be unemploymed and not spending?

Citation?  Now this one I agree with you, seeing as churches are exempt from this.  Churches don't have to marry ANYONE and can deny anyone for any reason.  A church isn't a business.  These laws ONLY applies to businesses open to the public.  Same goes for clubs or other organizations that aren't businesses.

>This couple is trying to use the government to force A Christian to go against his beliefs.

Again, a church is not a business, so this couple is barking up the wrong tree.  No law is being violated.

PoliticalDiscussion,post,subsidy,4d9un3,Mrs_Frisby,Should medicare be turned into a block grant to the states program with no provider billing like Bernie proposes?,"The full text of Bernie's [Healthcare NOW!/Medicare For all bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1782/text) is in this link.  In it he does the following:

* Extends enrollment into medicare to all US residents.
* Prohibits all federal socialized medical programs ( SCHIP, Medicaid, Tricare, etc ) except medicare from providing any medical services that compete with medicare and takes their funding away to be given to medicare - effectively destroying them.
* Decomissions the exchanges and appropriates ACA subsidy funding destroying it.
* Restructures Medicare into a block grant to the states program offloading a lot of the admin overhead of running it to the individual states ( so instead of one board there are 50 state level boards ).  
* Retains federal control over what services medicare must cover.
* Grants states the right to set the amount each service is paid for in that state with no guidelines or minimums ( So, for example, if 7th day adventists control your state government they could set the reimbursement rate for blood transfusions to a penny effectively providing no coverage at all - luckily for the guys reading this nobody hates your health care.  Us women aren't so lucky on that front ).
* Ends the current Medicare practice of allowing patients to go to a doctor that doesn't accept Medicare and then file for reimbursement themselves - only providers can file for reimbursement so doctor choice is more restrictive than current Medicare.
* Prohibits participating doctors from charging anything above the reimbursement rate set by the state ( provider billing).  So if the reimbursement rate is lower than the cost to provide a service the physician must either take a loss on the service, or stop providing the service to anyone, or not accept Medicare patients ( and again, you can't see them yourself then file a claim yourself for patient reimbursement since this isn't allowed anymore.).  
* Prohibits private insurance from covering anything Medicare covers. So if you are rural and your local physician can't pay off his student loans without provider billing ( or hey, just objects to Berniecare on principle ) then you have to pay them in cash.  You can no longer buy useful insurance they will accept.   If you can't you have to travel to an urban center to find a doctor willing to accept your Medicare.  Sort of like how Texas treats women trying to get abortions only for everything.

This strikes me as hideously regressive and unworkable.  He is, in essence, promising the *result* of a full on National Health Service - where doctors and hospitals are mostly state run with salary and living stipends and no student debt *through the mechanism of insurance reform*.  And thats impossible. You can't get there through insurance reform alone.  

But you can do a hell of a lot of damage *trying* and when I read that bill I see a mountain of really bad unintended consequences.  Bernie supporters, what am I missing?

The idea that 'marriage' was somehow de-emphasized by the de-segregation and a renewed focus on civil rights is rather outrageous.  

Furthermore, it's been shown that even during the greatest economic times of the last 150 years, such as the economic boom after WWII, when our Middle Class was truly born, minority communities were systematically oppressed and wallowed in horrifying levels of economic stagnation even a the white population were the primary beneficiaries of that economic boom.  

In short, systemic economic oppression of minority communities are what kept those minorities from joining in on that economic boom.  And by the time we got around to trying to dismantle that oppression with the 1965 Civil Rights Act, that boom was coming to an end and we ended up in a nation-wide cycle of expanding profits for businesses, but stagnating wages across the board.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,subsidy,l5d8g51,InvertedParallax,,">My argument is that modern (usually Republicans) believe that the Senate and electoral college over-represent rural areas to protect them from urban areas, and this is a desired design of the system. 

I think we may be talking slightly past each other.

IMHO, the original argument, ""The South must have sufficient power to block federal anti-slavery action"" was re-interpreted as ""State's rights!"", which persisted past the post-bellum era to this day.

The actual turning point was, however, the 14th amendment, which truly established constitutional supremacy over the states by forcing them to obey the bill of rights, which they were not subject to previously.

There was writing in the federalist papers about the role of the Senate in preserving the power of states, but also remember that before the ... 18th(?) amendment the senate was not elected but appointed by the party structure within the states.

At that point you have 1 sub-branch out of 3 that in any way represents the power of the states, while the executive and the house (which was actually the more powerful camera at the time given its power to draft bills, while the senate was expected to be less active, much like a modern ""house of lords"") were both heavily biased by the slave vote, and the judicial branch was picked by the president (and was heavily southern dominated to the civil war, including justice taney of Dredd Scott infamy).

I will give you that the senate was a sop to smaller states that they would not be trampled by the slave powers, but it was a small sop, particularly given the weakness of the senate at the time.

> This is not necessarily true. Groups of individuals can make rules for themselves, and voluntarily abide them. If you don't like a community's rules, then why live there?

How are the rules enforced though? With guns? Then that is simply a really small government. 

Pan-archy is a really intriguing idea to me. I like the idea of different communities with different laws to suit different kinds of people. Although I think there need to be some overarching laws to ensure efficient trade and to guarantee certain rights (such as the right to choose a new community). 

However it is decentralization of government that I believe in, not decentralization of the economy. 

> Correct. Except in the first instance, you are violating the will and right of the individual to not be aggressed against. Self defense is a natural right. The redistribution can be guised as serving the greater good, but for that individual, it is not in their interest, or ""good"" for them to have what they work for taken by force, regardless if it is done by a government, or a private actor.

""Aggression"" is defined in terms of the property rights which we collectively agree on. If we decide on redistribution, then resisting the redistribution would constitute aggression against the rightful recipient of that money. 

It is not in my interest, as an individual, to allow my competitor to get the job that I want. But part of living in society is sacrificing your personal interests to the common interest. 

> Ahh the old Somalia canard. anarchism is not chaos, it is a lack of government. There would still be order, and rules in an anarchic society, the difference would be they would be community based, and not imposed by a State.

> If you freed up all the inactively held land, there would be a diaspora away from cities, and those that choose to make a life off the land, would. As of right now, land costs money.

> I do believe that if people were allowed to ""opt out"" and go find some land to live on, they would. And they would be better off for it.

I can get on board with that. I think that it makes a lot of sense that if land is not being used, you should be able to live on it. Land belongs to all of us as our birthright, and its not right that some people hoard this fixed, given resource. 

> Again, why have progress if it is killing the landbase? What is more important to you..Shiny cool objects? or a habitable planet? If ""economic growth"" means doing more of what we're doing now, and faster, then I would rather we not grow at all.

I think its not technology's fault that we're killing the planet. Its our fault. Technology doesn't kill, people do. Technology is advancing much faster than our moral conscience about how we are affecting each other and the environment. But I'd argue that instead of putting a wrench in human potential by dismantling technology, we need to view this as a moral challenge, and we need to step up to the plate.

If you go beyond the moral conviction that foreign powers shouldn’t have been in Afghanistan in the first place, as it stands right now, do you think it’s justified for coalition forces to withdraw from Afghanistan fully? 

There where statements from local governance that withdrawal would mean civil war as the Afghani forces would be unable to fight of the Taliban. Essentially, by withdrawing, the coalition is inviting the Taliban to take over, enforce sharia law, take control of social life: women and education being two major spheres. 

On the other hand, if you look at the historical background of Afghanistan, since the 19th century, not a single global power has ever managed to conquer Afghanistan and enforce their rule, from the British empire, to American forces today, 20 years of useless conflict has left the Taliban with the same territorial power as they had at the start of the 21st century at the cost of tax payer money and human life. 

On a larger scale, I guess the question boils down to whether or not “western” powers should enforce western values abroad. 

- If say, Afghani women may not feel the need for sexual liberation and full emancipation, who is the west to enforce their values? Same thing with concepts of liberal democracy, the rule of law etc.

PoliticalDiscussion,post,taxes,n4bc5p,ThBaron,Do you think withdrawing out of Afghanistan is a good policy?,"I think it’s important to frame this argument properly. If you go beyond the moral conviction that foreign powers shouldn’t have been in Afghanistan in the first place, as it stands right now, do you think it’s justified for coalition forces to withdraw from Afghanistan fully? 

There where statements from local governance that withdrawal would mean civil war as the Afghani forces would be unable to fight of the Taliban. Essentially, by withdrawing, the coalition is inviting the Taliban to take over, enforce sharia law, take control of social life: women and education being two major spheres. 

On the other hand, if you look at the historical background of Afghanistan, since the 19th century, not a single global power has ever managed to conquer Afghanistan and enforce their rule, from the British empire, to American forces today, 20 years of useless conflict has left the Taliban with the same territorial power as they had at the start of the 21st century at the cost of tax payer money and human life. 

On a larger scale, I guess the question boils down to whether or not “western” powers should enforce western values abroad. 

- If say, Afghani women may not feel the need for sexual liberation and full emancipation, who is the west to enforce their values? Same thing with concepts of liberal democracy, the rule of law etc.

If you want to eliminate the welfare trap, you simply need to eliminate the incentives to **purposely avoid work** that are pervasive throughout the system.

One of the incentives to avoid work is the prohibition of anyone going half time or more from getting SNAP unless they have a signed statement from their employer guaranteeing they work 20 hours a week. It is designed to make it **effectively** impossible for anyone to go college and get SNAP while **officially** allowing it.

What would work for helping the lower class is eliminating the corporate income tax altogether. **Corporations don't pay income tax; their customers do.** This would provide America with an advantage as companies would relocate the facilities (and jobs) here for favorable taxation and lower prices, as it eliminates a cost that is passed on to customers.",2021-05-27T16:59:18+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

PoliticalDiscussion,post,taxing,n4bc5p,ThBaron,Do you think withdrawing out of Afghanistan is a good policy?,"I think it’s important to frame this argument properly. If you go beyond the moral conviction that foreign powers shouldn’t have been in Afghanistan in the first place, as it stands right now, do you think it’s justified for coalition forces to withdraw from Afghanistan fully? 

There where statements from local governance that withdrawal would mean civil war as the Afghani forces would be unable to fight of the Taliban. Essentially, by withdrawing, the coalition is inviting the Taliban to take over, enforce sharia law, take control of social life: women and education being two major spheres. 

On the other hand, if you look at the historical background of Afghanistan, since the 19th century, not a single global power has ever managed to conquer Afghanistan and enforce their rule, from the British empire, to American forces today, 20 years of useless conflict has left the Taliban with the same territorial power as they had at the start of the 21st century at the cost of tax payer money and human life. 

On a larger scale, I guess the question boils down to whether or not “western” powers should enforce western values abroad. 

- If say, Afghani women may not feel the need for sexual liberation and full emancipation, who is the west to enforce their values? Same thing with concepts of liberal democracy, the rule of law etc.

No, this distinction exists at the individual. There is no physical thing that makes a ""family"" a family, it is an abstract concept, something that only exists in the mind. Any group, family, neighborhood, country, etc is made up of individuals. The way you distinguish the difference between all of these subdivisions is arbitrary; it is simply ""decided"" to be so. Why is the world cut up into countries? Because it was decided so. Why can't the whole of the US be considered one state? because ""we"" decided it. Why are states divided into counties? because ""we"" decided it so. There is no physical difference, simply an imaginary line in the sand that ""distinguishes"" one ""group"" from another. Fundamentally, we are individuals; groups do not exist concretely.

Let me put it to you this way. Where do you draw the line with whom you consider to be your family? According to modern science, if you go back far enough, we are *all* genetically related and have a common ancestor from however long ago. The choice between who you call ""family"" is arbitrary. You simply decided ""how related"" one has to be in order to be in your ""family"". There is nothing concrete about it. The distinction only exists in the mind.

That being said, if it is from me, I want to clarify, since that basic approach looks like my general proposal I've shared on here several times.

When I promote a 40% tax and have a $15k UBI, I'm not saying we'd have a 40% tax JUST for UBI. 40% is the entire system. You actually only need around 18-25% tax for UBI if you want to go that route. 25% assumes a 40% TOTAL tax rate. THis also assumes 7.5% on the core federal budget remaining after I gut all the social programs that exist, and another 7.5% for universal healthcare (that being a VERY rough number for healthcare). 

Here are my numbers.

http://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/comments/1wi11j/eli5_basic_income_math/cf268pn

2) I wouldn't mind minor fees, especially for internet. I think the idea of municipal internet is a good one. I still want private sector to remain, but I'd like to see government increase competition with its own internet plans though.

As for college...18-22 year olds can live with their parents and then spend their UBI money on college, which should help reduce costs. More might be necessary though. Idk how much would be necessary to fund college though. 

UBI would significantly help those at the bottom, but might mean a reduction in benefits for those on welfare currently. However, since welfare is transient in nature, and because the current welfare system has a trap in it preventing mobility, UBI will be a superior option.

The middle class (as in, the actual MIDDLE of the distribution) would likely see lower taxes in practice. While they have the 40% tax rate on their earned income, UBI can be seen to replace deductions giving them, in effect, a similar or slightly better living standard.

Taxes on the top quintile may go up significantly in some places, even double from 20-40% or so, but this is worth it IMO because they'll still be very well off after taxes. Someone making 200k a year, for example, might be taxed at 80k, but with UBI, they'll only lose 65k, making their effective tax rate about 33%. This is higher than the current ~20% they pay now. But hey, they're  still making $135k after taxes, and that's still a good lifestyle.

Also, if anyone thinks society will grind to a halt after establishing UBI, show them this.

Your capital helps the business. Your risk doesn't really make a difference. In short, you are being rewarded for having money. This is what I'm talking about with ownership being rewarded over productivity.

Let me be clear about what I mean. It seems like you're trying to shoehorn what I said into a capitalist framework and are understandably running into some problems. I don't think it's ethical for individuals to own businesses, or for people to trade in shares of a business. Businesses should be run democratically for the same reason our countries are run democratically.

>So you are also against all forms of universal basic income, most forms of welfare, etc etc?

I think that there would be much less necessity for wealth redistribution if we distributed it properly to begin with. I think that certain kinds of safety nets encourage productivity and should be pursued. Allowing rampant unemployment/homelessness/drug addiction is wasting perfectly good labor.

I'm sorry if I gave you the impression that I was interested in perfect income equality. I agree with you that people are not equal, and I think it's good to reward those who contribute more to society. However, I think that there's a natural limit to how much value a person can create. There are only so many hours in a day, only so much energy a person has. If all of our wealth derived from our labor, there would still be a wealth gap, but it would be kept to a reasonable level. Consider what the highest-paying jobs make today without any investment or ownership rights. Allowing wealth to create more wealth is what lets people bypass this natural limit and accumulate wealth from other people's labor, which leads to the grotesque disparity we have now.",2021-05-12T04:13:01+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

(Also, the couple you mentioned is probably not going the family-based immigration route, they're probably going the employment-based immigration route--which has higher standards to meet, but is much faster if you can meet them.) Venezuela has much lower immigration demand to the US than Mexico does, so they can usually be processed faster. Mexico has the longest wait times in most categories; India and the Philippines also have much longer wait times than most countries in some categories because of demand outstripping the allowable numbers.

[Here's a website showing some of the current processing numbers.](https://www.boundless.com/blog/visa-bulletin/) So for Mexican (unmarried) adult children of U.S. citizens, they're currently processing visa applications from May 2000. If you're Chinese, though, the same category is up to applications from March 2016. The standards aren't evenly applied.

This is part of the problem in how people's judgments are formed--people see somebody from, say, Norway or Brazil who's able to immigrate in five years, and they think that path is available to every immigrant, so they judge people who don't take it. But with Mexico and a few other countries, there's a massive bottleneck, and the same path takes several times longer--in the future, in some cases, it will take so long that it effectively won't exist.",2021-06-21T17:23:18+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Politics,comment,debt,k8gdstj,madlipps,,"I should do an AMA on medical bills (quick edit: insurance is a scam) because it’s like half my job and I know it from the inside but I would be the first to say I don’t know everything and for certain there are exceptions to every rule but something I tell all my patients AND all my clients: never ignore a medical bill you “don’t remember having done” or “this has to be a scam”.  Do not ignore it, because while you ignore the bill, your clock is ticking to get the whole thing taken care of. The second you get a dumb medical bill you don’t understand call the number on top of the bill immediately.  Resolve the bill in your own mind and then you can figure out what to do next:

- did your insurance carrier process the bill? If you have no idea what the bill is for, call your carrier, too.  They can explain the bill.  If you disagree with how your carrier processed the claim, appeal it immediately.  Many carriers have a 90 day appeal time limit.  

- have insurance, but it doesn’t appear insurance processed s claim? Call the number on top of the bill.  Far too often (I see this every day with doctor billing) some providers are not forwarded your carrier info accurately (or at all).  It blows, but you may need to update your insurance info direct with your providers. One of the big issues I see with carriers is something called Coordination of Benefits.  Carriers will deny a claim, tell the provider it’s denied because the patient needs to update the information on the carrier end , but do not tell you that the reason your claims were denied was for that reason.  Your EOB will show a zero balance due.  It’s frustrating.

- don’t understand what a deductible / coinsurance / copay are? Congrats it’s numerical wizardry by your insurance carrier and part of the scam but it’s the reality of our situation.  Call your carrier with questions.

- don’t have insurance, but make too much money for Medicaid? You have two options.  Immediately call your providers and ask for financial assistance or charity care (charity care usually for private hospitals) or, if you think you won’t qualify, ask for for a self pay discount.  Again, many providers have a 90 day time limit to do these.  Once you go to collections these options dry up.  

Financial assistance and charity care are much more “liberal” when it comes to hospital bills.  Medical providers are much more strict.  They are not legally bound to offer either, but they do because they want their bills paid.  

Self pay discounts are often applied at a Medicare rate.  Anesthesia often does not allow self pay discounts to be applied!

- if you believe you qualify for Medicaid ask for help at the clinic / hospital to get all your paperwork in order.

Bottom line is they doctors and hospitals will bend over backwards to help you get your bills paid, but after a certain amount of time (usually 90 days), you are shit out of luck.

Edit: I forgot to add what happens when a bill goes to collections.  Agencies are notoriously underinforned - sometimes this is intentional.  There is also HIPAA regs they keep them in the dark.  But the first thing you do is call the number on the top of the bill (almost all agencies have standard bill templates).  Ask two questions: who is the provider, what is the date of service.  They have that info.  If you want to ask what it was for, go ahead, but they may not have that info.  If you truly have no idea, tell them you want to dispute.  Please be aware that a legal dispute is not an argumentative dispute - agencies can prove your dispute just by verifying you had the service (we investigated ourselves, and found nothlng wrong).  Too many times patients have come back to me telling me that they disputed the bill - not because they didn’t know what it was but because they didn’t think (want) they had to pay it.  Agencies often have limited settlement power but will always do payment plans.  If your insurance processed claims and the balances are deductibles, etc, in my experience my patients have never gotten settlements.  

Medical debt is still reportable to credit but more and more agencies don’t report because it’s a pain.  The CFPB is finally catching on and I’m guessing by this time next year medical debt will no longer be reportable (BUT may not be retroactive)",2023-11-09T03:25:02+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

The fact that they want to reduce enforcement as the way to lower taxes is ridiculous.  Enforcement makes it so everyone has a level playing field.  Everything I have heard about the IRS is that if you knowingly cheat your taxes you're in deep doo-doo.  If you unknowingly make a mistake, they just want the money and will work with you.  That is exactly how it should work and no one should morally have a problem with that.

Reducing enforcement just makes it so the slimier segments of our population take advantage by cheating their taxes while the people who follow the laws get hurt.

The budget hawks should be furious with this.  Budget hawks should be laser focused on what federal dollars yield the biggest return.  The Congressional Budget Office has said that every dollar of enforcement increases revenue by between $5 and $9.

It's saying that employer firms with fewer than 100 workers employed 32.4% **of total private sector employees**. That section you quoted is not subcategorizing them as a percentage of already-small businesses. It is giving the percentage of the entire private sector.

So 67.6% of the private sector is employed by firms with >100 employees, not ""~90%"".

I can see how you misunderstood what you did, but it's really really incredibly obvious that my understanding of the data is right and yours is wrong, when you back up to the very start of the article:

> Based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 6.1 million employer firms in the United States in 2019 (latest data).

> ● Firms with fewer than 500 employees accounted for **99.7% of those businesses.**

You're not going to see numbers like that and then think that

> ● Small businesses employ 46.8% of private-sector employees.

> ● Employer firms with fewer than 500 workers employed 46.4% of private sector payrolls in 2018.

means that ""46.4% of the 46.8% of private sector employees that work for small businesses, specifically work for firms with under 500 workers"". It's obvious that 46.4%, 32.4%, and 16% in your quote are the **total percentage**, not **subcategory percentage**.",2024-01-08T21:56:04+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Millennials are a large generation, but after that, Gen Z and Alpha look to be much smaller, meaning there won't be a similar time bomb ticking for the economy.

Here's a paragraph that doesn't make sense to me. It says that Millenials are a large generation but Gen Z and Alpha are much smaller so therefore no problem? It will be a big problem for Millenials since Gen Z and Alpha won't be big enough to support them. If the large size of the Millenial generation isn't enough to offset the cost of retiring Boomers, there is no way the cost of retiring Millenials can be offset.

GenX (my generation) will provide a little relief by being smaller than both Boomers and Millenials. Millenials pretty famously aren't having children in large numbers which is why Gen Alpha is so small. I get why. Childcare costs have now gone through the roof and are on par with college tuition. Millenials have also gone to college more than any previous generation and at a higher tuition rate and so many potential parents would be paying both loans and childcare simultaneously. Not having children is financially sensible in that situation. But it means Gen Alpha will not grow appreciably in the coming 5 years, when the 15 year generation span runs out.
In 2022, 69.58 Gen Z in US but only 38.55 Gen Alpha, a shortfall that is unlikely to be made up in 5 years by Millenials who can't afford children.

However, for all the smallness of US Gen Alpha, globally Gen Alpha is expected to be the largest generation ever. So retiring Millenials can be saved in the future if the US does an about-face on immigration and lets in Gen Alphas from around the world.",2024-02-06T13:39:52+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Politics,comment,expenditures,c3iwtqj,MrCobaltBlue,,"Wow, didn't know I accidentally logged into /r/corporatism...

Actually if you believe in the Constitution the government will stay completely out of business and the economy. Right now we have a system where the government picks and chooses the winners and losers. The corporations with the most money write the regulations and laws (SOPA/PIPA, for example) because the government got into the business of copyright enforcement. If they left that to a civil matter then we wouldn't have to worry about SOPA/PIPA because Hollywood would not have anything to gain by using the FBI as its personal copyright police.

Same thing with money in politics. Either you only elect morally superior politicians (and then you get into the whole argument of 'what is moral superiority?') or you don't give businesses a reason to pour millions into politics. If you let the markets regulate themselves then it puts more power back to you, the consumer.

The system Kucinich is advocating is no better, the questions have been raised where do the 'public funds' come from? And who decides what candidates 'deserve' the money?  Would the green party presidential nominee get as much as the Democrat or Republican? I'm a Libertarian, why should I pay to finance a Democrat? I have no say in where my money goes to. I suspect this will come from a new tax, correct? The government is going to use force against me to take my money to finance a candidate that I do not believe in?

Politics,comment,income tax,h22bxq9,NotGalenNorAnsel,,"Well, let's walk you through the analogy. Maybe that will help. 

 Why should you not drive like an asshole in your company truck, it's not illegal, and you might get to your job a couple minutes earlier?

I would argue that it reflects poorly upon your employer. People complain about it not because it was illegal, but because they didn't like the action they witnessed. It may speak to how they perform their job also. 

This person is applying to work for the government, the thing which they used legal gray areas to avoid taxes. Jimmy Carr had this issue very publicly in the UK a few years back. People do not like it when the system is manipulated to make a wealthy person wealthier-- this may speak to how they will perform the job. 

When we're talking about a candidate, votes decide if they get the job or not, so people voicing their distaste for the candidate's manipulating of the tax system which clearly was not intended to allow for such shady avoidance is not something that should be scorned, because I'd wager that the people complaining about this tax scoundrel also advocate for closing those loopholes, write-offs and subsidies.

The greater point is NO buinesses do not have a incentive to pay workers more. Workers may not ever use a businesses services. A janitor at an engineering firm will never be in a position to use the services of their employer, so the employer has no incentive to pay them more. Paying them more is BAD for business. 

  
Even for a place like Walmart, paying employees high wages is good for the local, regional, national economy in 5-10 years, but not on this year's profit statements.

The leaders of the church want to evaluate whether the children are loyal to the church or not, so they sexually abuse them and tell them to keep it a secret.

If they keep it a secret, then they're loyal, if they tell people, then they're not loyal and the leaders of the church will say that they're lying while pointing to their religion.

Excessive bail shall not be required, ***nor excessive fines imposed***, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.

>1. In the summer 1986 issue of a now-defunct magazine called Vermont Affairs: “All that socialism means to me, to be very frank with you, is democracy with a small ‘d.’ I believe in democracy, and by democracy I mean that, to as great an extent as possible, human beings have the right to control their own lives. And that means that you cannot separate the political structure from the economic structure. One has to be an idiot to believe that the average working person who’s making $10,000 or $12,000 a year is equal in political power to somebody who is the head of a large bank or corporation. So if you believe in political democracy, if you believe in equality, you have to believe in economic democracy as well.”

Finland and Sweden have national health care, free college, affordable housing and a higher standard of living. … . Why shouldn’t that appeal to our disappearing middle class?”

>11. In an interview with Democracy Now in November 2006: “In terms of socialism, I think there is a lot to be learned from Scandinavia and from some of the work, very good work that people have done in Europe. In countries like Finland, Norway, Denmark, poverty has almost been eliminated. All people have health care as a right of citizenship. College education is available to all people, regardless of income, virtually free. I have been very aggressive in trying to move to sustainable energy. They have a lot of political participation, high voter turnouts. I think there is a lot to be learned from countries that have created more egalitarian societies than has the United States of America.” ",2016-05-07T20:20:51+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

Now, the affluent could have easily funded the building of this club themselves by passing the hat amongst themselves but it never happened. Fast forward a few years and some of them are lamenting the condition of the hockey rink. This time they think they have the common folk behind him because in Canada, hockey is religion. The only caveat? The town needed funding from the other two levels of government and they got it only from one. They decided to have a pow-wow to raise $5M amongst the rich folk and try to raise the money. They got exactly $0.00 from them.

You might find this link interesting on this topic from the USDA   

https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/covid-impact-livestock-markets.pdf

I didn’t have time to go through it all and your right demand was definitely affected, especially with exports. When demand goes down prices should go down to right, along with meat companies adjusting for lower production if it keeps up.

However it appears that although restaurants meat demand when down by a lot. Super market demand for meat went up almost equally if not more, so the supply chain didn’t have to turn on a dime. 

I’m not against companies making money. I’m also okay with increasing prices during times of scarcity…..unless it’s a national emergency. Food is not a luxury item and we’re not talking porterhouse steaks (also FDA food pyramid that hasn’t been updated in like 80 years says meat is essential although vegetarian would disagree). In fact there are actually laws against price gouging on essential goods during an emergencies and for good reason since emergencies disrupt a true free market. 

At the end of the day, I think the biggest thing about the industries issues we’ve been talking about is the they should have had more of an impact on these companies “revenues” going either going up or down. Although their profit went up my 300%, I can tell you that their revenue certainly didn’t increase by anything close to 300%, which is not normal in the business world.",2021-12-27T13:12:43+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

You'll see many pessimistic and negative comments but please do not lose hope, do not give up and never stop voting for your ideals. It's important to be concerned but we should also consider the positives and build upon them while learning from mistakes. This was by no means an overwhelming victory across the country, nonetheless it was a major victory for the Democrats in the House of Representatives. Continue to stay informed, engaged, and involved. One year remains before the next Presidential election. It will be an arduous journey but continue to persevere, support your local candidates and you may see more results you had hoped for! 

**In their first act in Congress the House Democrats introduced House Resolution 1, a sweeping proposal focusing on campaign finance reform, anti-corruption measures and voting rights.^[[6]](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/30/18118158/house-democrats-anti-corruption-bill-hr-1-pelosi) However Mitch McConnell blocked the sweeping anti-corruption and election security bill. Here are the details of the Democrats bill;**

>**Campaign finance**

> - Public financing of campaigns, powered by small donations. Under Sarbanes’s vision, the federal government would provide a voluntary 6-1 match for candidates for president and Congress, which means for every dollar a candidate raises from small donations, the federal government would match it six times over. “If you give $100 to a candidate that’s meeting those requirements, then that candidate would get another $600 coming in behind them,” Sarbanes told Vox this summer. “The evidence and the modeling is that most candidates can do as well or better in terms of the dollars they raise if they step into this new system.”

> - Passing the DISCLOSE Act, pushed by Rep. David Cicilline (RI) and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (RI), both Democrats from Rhode Island. This would require Super PACs and “dark money” political organizations to make their donors public.

> - Passing the Honest Ads Act, championed by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (MN) and Mark Warner (VA), which would require Facebook and Twitter to disclose the source of money of political ads on their platforms, and share how much money was spent.

> **Ethics**

> - Requiring the president to disclose his or her tax returns.

> - Stopping members of Congress from using taxpayer money to settle sexual harassment cases or buy first-class plane tickets.

> - Giving the Office of Government Ethics the power to do more oversight and enforcement and put in stricter lobbying registration requirements.

> - Create a new ethical code for the US Supreme Court, ensuring all branches of government are impacted by the new law.

>**Voting rights**

> - Creating new national automatic voter registration that asks voters to opt out, rather than opt in, ensuring more people will be signed up to vote. Early voting and online voter registration would also be promoted.

> - Restoring the Voting Rights Act, part of which was dismantled by a US Supreme Court decision in 2013. Ending partisan gerrymandering in federal elections and prohibiting voter roll purging.

> - Beefing up elections security, including requiring the Director of National Intelligence to do regular checks on foreign threats.

Republican,comment,capitalism,fwjxtfh,Elshaddie,,"You’d be correct. The “welfare state,” as Heinlein predicted led to the fall of morales and civil society as a whole. I’m very careful how I classify myself, I’m an American conservative. While European conservatism is more about group identity (group membership only being acquired at birth.) American conservatism is far more about ideals. I believe we have actually given up capitalism for a system called socialism for the rich, if a car company fails the tax payers money is redistributed to it. 

The whole point of the welfare state that democrats prop up isn’t for the “commoner.” Their goal isn’t a post scarcity society but a stratified post discontent society. Even though the black community never benefits from voting democrat, which they’ve done every year for years now, they’ll continue to do so, they’ll vote blue no matter who. Right now is the stage In the takeover where they sift all discontent from the party to rule them to the party which they are told is evil and racist. History to them is irrelevant and must not be taught or if it is only the bad parts of the system. The goal in this stage is to make activist. To be clear I am not a Neo Nazi in fact I fight against Nazism. However, the world Democrats want to make is the world in The Turner Diaries. Why would they want this? Because they know that will cause people to become Neo Nazis. This will give them power. “You see we can’t have freedom of speech they are swaying people to their cause!” Or “look we have to ban guns or they’ll get them let’s ban them.” Both the Neo Nazis and these communist want this. The Neo Nazis refuse to act they’re  twirling their thumbs until public opinion favors them. 


Now what are both outcome in my opinion. 

Well for the far left is a post discontent society in which the party is always right and they have destroyed history. Where a sort of warped system made from globalism, syndicalism, and traditional Marxism is formed. They know that they must destroy border. No border no country, no country no national identity. No national identity then you have tribal conflicts. They know that they’ll be looked favorably if they swoop in and save the day. They can then have their post discontent society where you shower every other week, eat bugs, live in a depressing concret hive, and don’t have any parents because the collective raised you thus your loyalty lies with the state, they are your mother care taker, your father discipliner, and your god almighty. 

The far right wish for no borders. No borders no country, no country no national identity. Do not be fooled they don’t care about western civilization or culture. Jared Tayler once said “tribalism has no art or customs just the preservation of the folk.” Jared Tayler is the spokesman for American Renaissance. No customs, no art, no culture. They only care about demographics and statistics. 

With no national identity and tribal conflict going on they can swoop in and dominate. They wish for a completely homogenized world where the party is always right. All history is “probably,” explained with no “propaganda.” Evil satanic statues like that if lady liberty will be replaced with “the man against time.” The church will be crushed and the O9A will take its place. This is the goal. 

I can’t stand when people say I’m some horseshoe theorist. I believe both extremes are doing the same thing currently for different goals. I also believe when you go to the extreme that you inherently become authoritarian and downright evil. Not that communism and Nazism are the same which they are not I just believe they are both bad. 


To swing it up and wrap up my lengthy rant. Democrats are using the black community as a test population for their future goals. No fathers make the population is easy to manipulate with pop culture and celebrities. However it leads to higher crime rate. They need to figure out how to fix that before they move it to the other populations. They also wish to lower IQ. Now iq is affected by genetics but also by environment. Less nutrition, less mental stimulation, less iq. IQ is being disparaged and they’re calling Stem Steam despite these arts not being game development or film but vomiting on a canvas. The Dems don’t see that this game they are playing is so stupid. If you play stupid games your gonna win stupid prizes. I don’t think anyone thinks a nuclear war could start because of all of this, but I do and I’m writing this down so I can say I told you so to a lot of people.",2020-07-01T04:50:38+00:00,,,,,,,,,,

You see a 60 kwh machine and argue the gas milage of a tesla.

Youre taking the most efficient and expensive EV and charging it with a small generator.

Humans are greedy

We will not see 60s or 50s when EVs are roaming the roads more often than combustion engines.

They will all be maxxed out running 75% and the cheap ass dinger most joes can afford will get about 200 to 300 miles. 

The entire renewable power grid of california can only support 3 percent of the energy demand at max efficiency.

Other times the energy is imported from out of state, which is mainly in the form of oil.

Youre using oil if you turn on your microwave.

So who really cares about your mileage?
