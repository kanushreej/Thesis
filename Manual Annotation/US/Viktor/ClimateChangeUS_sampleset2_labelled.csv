If France had coal reserves like Germany or fossil gas like the Netherlands they wouldn't have bothered with nuclear energy. CO2 emissions was the last thing they cared about.

Given the outcome of [Flamanville 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamanville_Nuclear_Power_Plant) and [cost escalations of their upcoming reactors](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/french-utility-edf-lifts-cost-estimate-new-reactors-67-bln-euros-les-echos-2024-03-04/), before they have even started building, the future for the French industry is looking incredibly bleak.

Today we should hold on to the existing French fleet as long as they are safe and economical. Pouring money in the black hole that is new built nuclear simply prolongs the climate crisis and are better spent on renewables.

We should of course continue with basic research for nuclear energy since it is a great technology for humanity to wield. Throw up a demonstration Terraform reactor. But it is **basic research** and not a solution to climate change.

Climatechange,comment,anthropogenic,k5dz21x,SnooMarzipans7682,,"1). 40 years ago the same groups were hysterical about the coming ice age. All the smartest assholes then had all the answers. Never happened. 

Today all the smartest assholes are hysterical about climate change and all the worst possible case scenarios. 

I’m not denying climate change, I’m saying people get tired of hearing bullshit predictions that don’t come true. 

2). Canada for example produces 1.5% of global emissions. Yet the climate people want to shut down the economy, make people pay carbon tax etc in the name of climate change.  Canada should be increasing exports of nat gas etc as it reduce overall global emissions. 

At the same time china is bringing in coal fired plants at an insane rate. 

3). We need to cut nitrogen use by 20% the climate people say. Sure but the result will be millions more people starve. 

It’s not that people question climate change in my experience. Its the retarded “solutions” that are being shoved down our throats, the ever increasing taxes in the name of the environment that don’t actually do any good.

It’s the Suzuki’s who tell us how horrible we are while he flies around to his multiple homes.

When the IPCC is headed by the same guys that choose which studies get published, it's nothing more than a circle jerk.  It's going to say exactly what they want it to say.

>And, again, you've established you are just pushing misinformation instead of responding to the peer-reviewed analysis. Try again.  


Not at all.  But it's hilarious the hostility.  If this were just about anything else, no one would be using that level of hostility.  Even the anti-flat-earth sites and youtube channels aren't nearly as hostile.  You show your hand.  It's not about science, it's a religion.

>Categorically false, but keep on lying. Peer- reviewed consensus isn't ""conjecture"".  


It might as well be when they pick and choose which studies to include, and which to fund.

Also are you suggesting proxy measurements are more reliable than direct measurements?

>And you have yet to provide any evidence of such. Like all misinformation bits, you talk a mediocre game and provide zero evidence of your claims.

No more than you have.  If you were actually interested in debating in good faith, I might actually spend the time to go into detail.  But since you're trolling, then I'm trolling.  You set the rules, I just play by them.

>I used the plain language article that directly links the study.

Then go ahead, link the study.  Why the pretense?

>Exactly, because higher CO2 concentrations increase heat, which ultimately is not helpfully for plant growth. That's precisely what the article said.  


That's not what the headline suggested, nor did you suggest, nor what I was proposing.  I said CO2 levels, you said CO2 levels, the article headline said CO2 levels.  What the studied showed was that HEAT not CO2 levels inhibited plant growth.

The most charitable interpretation of that, is disingenuous, more likely intentionally deceptive.

[https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/greenhouse-carbon-dioxide-supplementation.html](https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/greenhouse-carbon-dioxide-supplementation.html)

[https://www.ontario.ca/page/supplemental-carbon-dioxide-greenhouses](https://www.ontario.ca/page/supplemental-carbon-dioxide-greenhouses)

The reality is that more CO2 than is currently available in the atmosphere is beneficial to plant growth.  Across every single plant species that they've tested (AFAIK).

>Again, wrong, as established on a global scale.

It hasn't been established, merely claimed by IPCC 'models' (aka wishful thinking).

>Let me get this straight: ""a small group of people who control the IPCC""... yet this small group has written over 90,000 papers in the last 11 years. 

Multiple times now you've attempt to misrepresent what I've claimed.  There's no one else here.  You're not going to deceive me, so are these strawman arguments meant to deceive yourself?  Why the use of logical fallacies if your position is so strong?

See, there's one thing I've found that serves me well.  No one cheat in a race they're going to win, no one cheats on a test they'll ace.  IF someone is lying,  cheating, using logical fallacies, they're tell you that THEY don't believe THEIR own argument.

If you truly believed what you are saying is 100% the truth, and I was completely false, you would not need to misrepresent my position to argue against it.

But to the point, no I did not claim they wrote 90,000 papers (and this goes further back than 11y, it started in the late 90s).  What I claimed is that the handful of people that choose which papers get published, are the same ones that run the IPCC, and choose who gets funding.",2024-01-24T23:55:43+00:00,t1_kjf91ih,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

All good.  I just think if you were looking for ""party line"" on this or abortion... there isn't really one.

Tons of libertarians would love to give you their personal opinions, of course... but there are some issues with the party where major disagreement is very common, due to party being less about specific issues and more about larger principles/concepts.

Granted, if libertarian party became a major party ever then I'm sure it would become more hive-minded and centered around current most dominant political figures in party... so may be less due to ""being more principled"" and more due to its unfortunate 3rd party irrelevance.  Meh.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,climate change,ie16ll0,Shy-Mad,,"> Why is American politics is generally more socially conservative compared to other Anglophone countries?

Because 50 states with every ethical background imaginable working in unison and yet separate and independent is harder to do than talking centuries long native residents in a country the size of a state to do something. Especially when your not dumping billions yearly into aid for 3/4 of the world. 

> In most other Anglophone countries, the abortion debate is essentially dead (in favor of allowing it), the death penalty has been abolished and is unlikely to ever be brought back, gun control is supported by virtually everyone including right-leaning politicians and voters, the thought of abolishing universal healthcare would be considered political suicide, climate change is widely considered to exist (even if some right-wing people disagree on how much of a problem it is), and being overly religious or denying evolution are considered political faux pas. Even in Anglophone countries where some areas are hotbeds of social conservatism (notably Canada and Alberta), these countries still generally lean more to the left or are otherwise less right-leaning than the US.

So yes these are the debates, but all right leaning people don’t “deny” evolution. A small fringe extremist group does and we let them say what they want. Fuck it it’s a free country. 

Abortions- that’s great you guys allow it. Some of us don’t agree on it. And some of us just don’t think the federal govt should be sticking their noses into state business. If all 50 states legalized it, it would be a non issue. The issue with roe was the federal government’s overstep into state business. It would be like People from Paris and Amsterdam pushing legislation for all of Europe. 

Guns- It’s as simple as it’s a constitutional right. And we wrote that into the constitution because of lessons learned from Europe. Right our founding fathers came from Europe, and your cheeky rulers did sketchy shit that the peasants could have prevented if they had weapons. So we said that the people should be armed so no one does to us what those European ruler’s did to their people. 

Climate change- yeah some nut jobs exist ( in Europe too), but most like you said question the severity. A lot that I’ve talked to don’t deny climate change they disagree with the plan to combat it. The real debate isn’t on wether climate change is real, it if we should invest in wind and solar or hydro and nuclear. 

Universal healthcare- European countries all have different universal healthcare systems. It’s not a blanket European Union one. Also there comes a lot of concerns with America doing this universal thing. Which model do we use a Canadian idea or Switzerland one, both  are technically universal healthcare systems but way different. What is being advocated for here is medicare for all. Which is being advocated for by 10% of the country who are roughly between the ages of 18-25 year olds who a just jealous our poor people get something for free that they dont. 

> How and why did the politics of other non-American Anglophone countries become less right-leaning or even be left-leaning compared to the US? 

Ready for this? It’s guilt. Europeans for centuries spent their days just raping and pillaging all the colors of the world. Forcing them all to be enslaved and pray to Jesus. Then America came on the scene, wrote the Declaration of Independence, told you fucks you need one too. Then we demonstrated and showed you that there is more ways to run a country than just  inbred monarch’s and conquering dictatorships. 

So what did you guys do? You grabbed that ball and ran with it. Now IMO your ran a little too far out in left field, you might as well be playing a different game. 

Now your looking back and not sure if you went too far, that’s why questions like this arise. Your in left field and you look back and see a third of Americans are behind ya screaming “Keep Going!” And the rest are still where you left them. Now you think to yourself well we got to be doing something right 30% of Americans are following.

EVs have another crucial advantage: A vast, nationwide electrical system already exists. A nationwide transition to electric vehicles creates big challenges, including the need to build a charging network and make plenty of extra (hopefully clean!) electricity to power all these cars and trucks. But, Paltsev says, those tasks are less herculean than building a new hydrogen economy. “You don’t really need to create another infrastructure for electric cars.”

However, hydrogen has its own issues. Nearly all the hydrogen used today is extracted from natural gas, in a process that creates CO2 as a byproduct. Carbon capture systems can be used to keep that CO2 out of the atmosphere (a setup experts call “blue hydrogen”), but that makes already-pricey hydrogen even more expensive. The gold standard would be “green hydrogen”: a process that uses clean electricity to extract hydrogen from water. But today, this is a costly way to make hydrogen2—and just as EVs demand a lot of new clean electricity to fill up our cars, green hydrogen requires new clean electricity to produce hydrogen.

Though batteries and solar panels have a limited life and lose efficiency every year, so there will be diminishing returns and may be some maintenance or repair costs over time.  On the flip side, you may have some good state and local tax credits available for such a system, which is a good bonus.  
  
If you figure a 25 year timeline for your solar system that matches closely with the lifetime SPY index fund (started early 1993).  I'm not sure what your solar/battery system will cost you, but let us assume $ 30,000.  That would have bought roughly 667 shares when it started in Feb 1993 ($ 44.96/share).  Today that would be worth $ 177,995.62 plus it would have also generated $ 38,846 in dividends over the 25 year period.  
  
My point here is if you're looking to ""print money"", have you considered alternative uses for that capital investment and is the solar system still the best money printer?",2018-01-01T23:08:40+00:00,t1_ds1nat9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,climate change,h8wb4us,rationalcommenter,,"Bubbles already naturally form without social media. It’s not new. The goal shouldnt be to undo something we naturally gravitated towards—but to accept and use it.

I don’t give a shit about finding something that’s the automatic negation of some stance I see. My goal is to see the stance I agree with *implemented*. I care about mobilizing and activism towards that goal.

Literally all this needless hopefulness for contrarianism does is ensure some political stance gets implemented, but kicking and screaming through droves of apathetic voters that can’t be assed to involve themselves.
