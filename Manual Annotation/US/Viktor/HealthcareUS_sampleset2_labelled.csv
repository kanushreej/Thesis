PoliticalDiscussion,comment,privatized,dcgumg9,TheManWhoWasNotShort,,"Reparations is a difficult concept because different people mean different things by it.  For example, a government check to all black people.  This doesn't make sense because it's only a temporary gain, and has no long-term benefit except ammunition for people who don't want to actually tackle systemic issues to claim they've already done their part.  It also wades into murky water regarding descendants of relatively recent immigrants, black and white alike.

Others mean reparations by righting systemic oppression.  These folks I am inclined to agree with: our nation owes it to the black community to undo the disadvantages created by years of systemic oppression by ending the ways the system has oppressed them and committing to reversing the cycle of poverty.  I think that ending cyclical poverty is not only a noble goal, but it's  necessary if our nation wants to to continue to grow and not stagnate or fall apart.

However, the term reparations is itself controversial. If I say ""I want to fix school funding in low income areas to give those children the resources they need to succeed"", a lot of people can get behind that and support it.  If I call the same thing ""reparations"", a lot of people think I'm being racially divisive and trying to punish white people.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Medicare,d17uepv,ClockOfTheLongNow,,"> Your argument is inherintly partisan and far from the vast majority view of the country.

If you have an issue with the facts I've stated, please note them.  The only ""partisan"" viewpoint I've stated is regarding Bush's spending/taxation, the rest are simply what we know about the past.

> When we are talking about what is responsible we are talking about something that is a consensus view of how something should be done. 

A majority has been shown to want to allow a ban on flag burning.  That's not responsible.

If a majority decides that we should raise tax dollars so everyone gets a pony, that's not responsible.

Your idea of ""responsible"" is a family deciding they want to buy a Camaro even though the two breadwinners work at Target.  Sure, they *can* buy the Camaro, and the majority want it, but how is that really going to work out for them?

> Your view on government might be what you consider to be the best thing, but you cannot claim that it should be universally called ""fiscal responsibility"" as so much of the country disagrees that your views are the least bit responsible or safe. 

That's the beauty of it: it doesn't matter if anyone disagrees with it.  Taking more from taxpayers to spend on things that the government cannot afford in perpetuity simply is not responsible.  You can argue that we should do it anyway because it's moral/it's the ""right"" thing to do/social justice/economic justice, but it doesn't make it responsible.

To put it another way, it might be right for me to purchase solar panels and put them on my home.  It's morally good, it's environmentally good, but the cost of them and the risk involved does not make it *responsible*.

> The phrase has meaning because it can be universally accepted by Democrats and Republicans. But your version obviously cannot be.

That's the problem, isn't it?  One side isn't responsible, but wants to be considered responsible, so we *must* develop a definition that will accept both points of view lest we say ""you're actually not responsible.""

I'm interested in straight talk on this issue.  Maybe someone wants to be considered environmentally friendly, but they water their yard at noon every day in the summer while driving a Hummer.  Why entertain it?

> And when it comes to Bush, you can claim that him cutting taxes was good. That is fine, cutting taxes is not inherintly irresponsible. But what was inherintly irresponsible about Bush was the combination of lowering taxes while raising spending in a time of economic prosperity.

The spending was the irresponsible part, not the tax cuts.  Not all deficit spending is inherently bad, not all revenue declines are inherently bad.  What was bad was not even that he spent more: Iraq had an endpoint, but where is the endpoint for a prescription drug benefit?  Where is the endpoint for the 60% increase in education funding?  It's irresponsible not because of the debt it incurred, but because of the spending it puts future taxpayers on the hook for.

> The reason why Obama doesn't fall into the same inherent category is because of the disagreement on whether deficit spending is good or bad in an economic crisis. You are in a very small minority (in America) that it is bad.

No serious commentator considers Obama to be a responsible spender.  On the surface, his institutional increases on social spending combined with his tax hikes are enough to push him out of that for good.  He's getting a lot of credit for the declining deficit by people not looking closely at the why (a lack of a budget keeps the baseline low because his budgets have gotten very few total votes more often than not, and the ""unpopular"" sequester that he came up with but tries to distance himself from helped as well), meaning that the incurious media gives him a pass.

Libertarian,post,Obamacare,98gecq,James_Sultan,Is Trump the “most libertarian president ever?” (Discussion thread),"I keep hearing this idea that “Trump is the most libertarian president ever!” and so I think it is important to look back at some of his views/actions as president. I’m going to try to be as unbiased as possible in the list before giving my opinion. If I make a mistake or want to add something, tell me and I’ll edit this post.


Pro-libertarian:

Regulation rollback
Tax cuts
Tried to repeal Obamacare, but... (I’ll explain)
Has opened up to the idea of legalizing weed for medical purposes at least (or leaving it up to the states)
Supports school choice
Reduced funding for certain govt programs


Anti-libertarian:

Travel ban
Tariffs and subsequent subsidies 
Increased military spending
Families at borders crisis (“supposedly” an Obama policy, however)
Supports death penalty
Wants to make 3D printed guns illegal
...(back to the health care issue) he still supported public healthcare instead of scrapping the policy altogether


So with this in mind, is it accurate to claim Trump is the most libertarian president? And on the flip side, is it accurate to say he’s the most authoritarian?

To me, Trump has not had enough policies that limit government, nor do the policies that do limit government go far enough. I would need to see some of Ron Paul come out in Trump, like ending the Fed and IRS, and he needs to stop pandering some of his beliefs to the left, like wanting to keeping public healthcare while trying to repeal Obamacare and opposing 3D printed guns. Yeah, some of these beliefs are just fantasy, but I would need to see Trump actively fighting against big government and not half-ass the dismantlement of the parts of government he doesn’t like (for example, cutting funding for EPA instead of cutting it altogether) before I’d even consider him a “libertarian president.” Inb4 I know the constitutional limits of a president’s powers, but that doesn’t mean they can’t create a policy agenda going forward and discuss policies they’ll support with Congress.

Conservatives,post,hospitals,17o2zgn,Head_Estate_3944,French Jewish woman stabbed in her home during antisemitic attack,"A swastika was painted on the door by her attacker.

A Jewish woman in her thirties was attacked in her own home in the Montluc district of Lyon’s 3rd arrondissement on Saturday, raising immediate concerns about an antisemitic motive behind the violence.

The woman, who suffered two stab wounds to the abdomen, was discovered with a swastika painted on her door. According to a number of media reports in France, while her injuries were considered serious, they were not life-threatening, and she was receiving medical care in the hospital.


Le Figaro, confirming earlier reports from Le Progrès, detailed that the attack occurred around 1 p.m. when an individual dressed in dark clothing and with a concealed face knocked on the victim's door. Upon answering, she was assaulted and subsequently rushed to the emergency room.

The presence of a mezuzah at her doorway, a traditional Jewish symbol, alongside the swastika points to a hate crime, prompting the Lyon public prosecutor’s office to suggest an ""antisemitic motive"" in their preliminary assessment, though not all authorities in France have yet to determine if it is considered an antisemitic attack.

As reported by BFMTV, the mayor of Lyon, Grégory Doucet, took to social media to condemn the violence, offering his full support to the victim and her relatives. Doucet's statement underscored the community's dismay and the urgent need for solidarity in the wake of such events.

The legal representative for the victim, attorney Stéphane Drai, confirmed on BFMTV that a complaint will be lodged for ""attempted homicide,"" highlighting a worrisome trend where expressions of hate are escalating into physical attacks. Police have taken up a position in the victim's hospital room to conduct their investigation and are working to track down the assailant.

Surging antisemitism in France
This stabbing took place amid growing concerns about antisemitic acts in France, due to the violent conflict between Israel and the Hamas terrorist group in Gaza. The hashtag #JeSuisJuif has emerged on social media, advocating for awareness and a stand against rising antisemitism in the country, just as it did in 2015, after the attack on a Kosher supermarket in Paris.

The judicial police, along with departmental security, announced that they are handling the inquiry, indicating the severity with which this incident is being treated. 

Last week, it was reported that France has witnessed a shocking surge in antisemitic incidents since the October 7 Hamas massacre in southern Israel. A staggering 819 such acts have been reported – nearly double the total for all of 2022, according to the latest report confirmed on Monday by French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin.

This surge has sent shock waves throughout the French Jewish community, with many expressing a deep sense of fear and dread reminiscent of darker periods in history. The sudden increase has raised alarming questions about the state of tolerance and security for Jews in France.

Chairman of the World Zionist Organization, Yaakov Hagoel, reacted to the stabbing and said in a statement on Saturday night: ""Antisemitism is currently inflicting brutality not just in Israel, but regrettably across the entire Jewish world. The Jewish people have endured persecutions, pogroms, and the Holocaust. We have come out of these attempts to annihilate us only stronger. Even in these times, we will continue to unite in our strength and demonstrate to the world that we cannot be broken. The nation of Israel lives on, strong and united.""

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,health care,dctmlc5,frecklepower,,"[About 40%](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/2114/5089/0863/2014-2015_PPFA_Annual_Report_.pdf), or about $554 million of PP's revenue comes from government funding. 74.7% of their funding is spent on [providing patient services](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=4338). I imagine the loss of 40% of PP's funding would severely hinder their ability to provide those patient services.

Cecile Richards makes $754,166 per year, or 0.37% of the organization's yearly expenses. This compared to the average hospital CEO salary of [$595,781](http://www.healthline.com/health-news/hospital-ceo-pay-rises-while-americans-in-medical-debt#2)- and these are CEOS of single nonprofit hospitals, not leaders of a nation-wide network of clinics. Her salary is approximately 0.14% of the total federal funding the organization receives- perhaps if they slashed pay entirely for all executives, they could bring that up to 1%. Not quite enough to make up the difference. 

Approximately 12.7% of funds, or about $25.3 million, were spent on fundraising. Still not quite enough to make up that deficit if they are defunded. In addition, PP has long been the target of defunding campaigns. To them, money spent on political campaigns to keep the organization afloat seems like a smart investment. I'd hazard to guess that given the choice, they would love to redirect the money they put towards political action towards patient care.

Libertarian,comment,privatized,k7u1o5n,skeletus,,"There's a whole book on roads and urban planning called Strong Towns. It basically lays out the urban planning pre government. The book analyzes how the first cities in the US were formed before all these regulations existed and how they transformed into wastelands after the regulations were put in place. If there was no government, there would still be roads, but there would be much less roads. Under capitalism, resources are distributed as efficiently and humanly possible. Most of the roads we have nowadays are not needed. The urban sprawl is ridiculous and it's all thanks to zoning laws, building codes, car centric urban design, and more regulations.

Urban sprawl is literally unsustainable. The population density is kept artificially low. Low population density yields less tax revenue per area to maintain the roads and infrastructure. So, city governments expand the urban sprawl in the hopes to get more revenue from the new residents and use that new revenue to maintain the old infrastructure. This is a vicious cycle that spirals down to a very predictable point. This would've never happened if government would've stayed in its lane.

So it's not that there would be no roads, it's that there would be way less roads because we wouldn't really need most of the roads we have nowadays. We would be able to walk to the places we need to go and get there in 10 minutes as opposed to having to drive for 20 minutes like we have to do today.",2023-11-04T20:14:46+00:00,t3_17nrngl,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Geopolitics,comment,hospital,i1s9jgh,TMWNN,,"> In the case of the Quebec referendum, it was determined that secession would require a constitutional amendment, which is by no means a simple task.

That's grossly oversimplifying *Reference Re Secession of Quebec*. Quebec nationalists liked the outcome because it found that The Rest of Canada *must* after a successful and valid independence referendum, negotiate with Quebec (or any province) to help make it happen.

Further, while the court found that a unilateral declaration of independence is not legal (or, more accurately, insufficient), it also found that the question of secession is a political question, not a legal one.

For why, this is important, think back to the 1995 referendum. It's now known that had the Yes side won, Parizeau would have issued a UDI almost immediately. At that point, whether a UDI is legal/sufficient is immaterial; what matters is whether the government and people of Quebec believe and act as if it is, and whether Ottawa will use physical force to prevent such an interpretation. No one really believed in 1995 that the federal government would use the military to prevent secession. At that point international diplomatic recognition is what counts; France and the Francosphere would have quickly recognized Quebec as a sovereign country (quite possibly the same day as any UDi), and that would be enough to persuade the rest of the world over time. Ottawa, London, and Washington would have come around eventually.

If an independence referendum wins in Quebec or any other province, the court has given tacit clearance for that province's government to, if TROC refuses to cooperate, unilaterally declare independence. We might see such a referendum passing in Alberta in, say, 2028; Ottawa and the other provinces (except Quebec, because even the most federalist government in Quebec City isn't going to set the precedent against such) refusing to cooperate in amending the Constitution; and the provincial government citing *Re Secession* to UDI. (Bonus points if you imagine a second Trump administration immediately recognizing Alberta's sovereignty. Even more bonus points if you imagine Edmonton and Washington also announcing the start of negotiations for US annexation.)

Bottom line: It's tough to read *Re Secession* as not a big win for Quebec or any other province's ability to secede from Canada.",2022-03-23T12:08:11+00:00,t1_i1qm302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
