He also has made various *reasons and excuses* for why he had highly classified documents held in his residence in Florida. His *story* always changes on the classified documents incident. He also treats people badly by calling them hurtful nicknames, and threatens people who have the temerity to dare to testify against him.  Is this his *”personality”*?

Again, Canada has good healthcare without threatening citizenship, the most basic human right there is, as a perk that can be revoked based on the actions of their parents. 20% of all Canadians were born outside Canada, and every single one of their children are and will forever be Canadian, the place of their birth.

Germany took in millions of cultural Germans from Poland and Czechia in the 40s and they got automatic and full citizenship, but people from Turkey which had been in Germany in large numbers since for decades, their kids in the 40s were not citizens. Nor in the 60s. By the time they gave them citizenship it was families three or four generations deep that had been living in Germany without citizenship.

That's what I mean when I say you reject universal brotherhood. You have more or less compassion based not on where they live but what their bloodline is. I have a friend who has never been to Ireland in her life, but because her ancestors were Irish she could apply for and get Irish citizenship by her bloodline.

That's the main difference between the hemispheres, because again it's not just the US. When you are from here, you are of here. Doesn't matter anything else, you are here now so we will make room for you. And if you're born here, you will always have the right to return.

In addition, even if one admin is making more arrests that probably lead to them being released, I would guess that even the fact that officials are being more aggressive in regards to arrests and patrolling areas, it would still act as somewhat of a deterrent, to someone considering crossing the border.

This would take scarce resources away from the real poor and give it to the middle class, just because they choose to live in a decadently expensive area.

On a broader level though, relative poverty should not be our focus. The greatest potential for the west to do good is to allow people in absolute poverty from the developing world to come to nations with liberal protections and booming economies. These people can be made far better off, and this is a huge way to increase the human flourishing on earth and reduce absolute suffering. 

But this might actually **increase** relative poverty! Poor people from the developing world without language skills often cannot get high paying jobs by western standards.

That isn't how human society works. The presence of a disruption is what forces a society to change. It shows society how and where change needs to happen. It's like that story from WWII where engineers needed to look at the planes' bullet holes to figure out where to add armoring.

There was a point back during America's Civil War that many white abolitionists wanted to send black people back to Africa. It was the freed black people that fought staunchly against that and in favor of an America not defined by the color of your skin. White people didn't lead the Civil Rights Movement. Blacks did. The recipients of racism are the ones who fight hardest to hold America to her ideals. 

Considering Europe's history with fascism, it's understandable you just want immigrants to go away in order to contain the new alt-right. But you have to understand that immigrants are not the cause of the alt-right's rise. They are simply the scapegoat. If not for them, the alt-right would find someone else to blame. When you buy into their narrative about immigrants, you give the alt-right more power, not less.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Visa,cmb57ub,liatris,,"http://cis.org/immigrant-welfare-use-2011

Thirteen years after welfare reform, the share of immigrant-headed households (legal and illegal) with a child (under age 18) using at least one welfare program continues to be very high. This is partly due to the large share of immigrants with low levels of education and their resulting low incomes — not their legal status or an unwillingness to work. The major welfare programs examined in this report include cash assistance, food assistance, Medicaid, and public and subsidized housing.

Among the findings:

In 2009 (based on data collected in 2010), 57 percent of households headed by an immigrant (legal and illegal) with children (under 18) used at least one welfare program, compared to 39 percent for native households with children.

Immigrant households’ use of welfare tends to be much higher than natives for food assistance programs and Medicaid. Their use of cash and housing programs tends to be similar to native households. 

A large share of the welfare used by immigrant households with children is received on behalf of their U.S.-born children, who are American citizens. But even households with children comprised entirely of immigrants (no U.S.-born children) still had a welfare use rate of 56 percent in 2009. 

Immigrant households with children used welfare programs at consistently higher rates than natives, even before the current recession. In 2001, 50 percent of all immigrant households with children used at least one welfare program, compared to 32 percent for natives. 

Households with children with the highest welfare use rates are those headed by immigrants from the Dominican Republic (82 percent), Mexico and Guatemala (75 percent), and Ecuador (70 percent). Those with the lowest use rates are from the United Kingdom (7 percent), India (19 percent), Canada (23 percent), and Korea (25 percent). 

The states where immigrant households with children have the highest welfare use rates are Arizona (62 percent); Texas, California, and New York (61 percent); Pennsylvania (59 percent); Minnesota and Oregon (56 percent); and Colorado (55 percent). 

We estimate that 52 percent of households with children headed by legal immigrants used at least one welfare program in 2009, compared to 71 percent for illegal immigrant households with children. Illegal immigrants generally receive benefits on behalf of their U.S.-born children.

Illegal immigrant households with children primarily use food assistance and Medicaid, making almost no use of cash or housing assistance. In contrast, legal immigrant households tend to have relatively high use rates for every type of program. 

High welfare use by immigrant-headed households with children is partly explained by the low education level of many immigrants. Of households headed by an immigrant who has not graduated high school, 80 percent access the welfare system, compared to 25 percent for those headed by an immigrant who has at least a bachelor’s degree. 

An unwillingness to work is not the reason immigrant welfare use is high. The vast majority (95 percent) of immigrant households with children had at least one worker in 2009. But their low education levels mean that more than half of these working immigrant households with children still accessed the welfare system during 2009. 

If we exclude the primary refugee-sending countries, the share of immigrant households with children using at least one welfare program is still 57 percent.

Welfare use tends to be high for both new arrivals and established residents. In 2009, 60 percent of households with children headed by an immigrant who arrived in 2000 or later used at least one welfare program; for households headed by immigrants who arrived before 2000 it was 55 percent. 

For all households (those with and without children), the use rates were 37 percent for households headed by immigrants and 22 percent for those headed by natives. 

Although most new legal immigrants are barred from using some welfare for the first five years, this provision has only a modest impact on household use rates because most immigrants have been in the United States for longer than five years; the ban only applies to some programs; some states provide welfare to new immigrants with their own money; by becoming citizens immigrants become eligible for all welfare programs; and perhaps most importantly, the U.S.-born children of immigrants (including those born to illegal immigrants) are automatically awarded American citizenship and are therefore eligible for all welfare programs at birth.

The eight major welfare programs examined in this report are SSI (Supplemental Security Income for low income elderly and disabled), TANF (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families), WIC (Women, Infants, and Children food program), free/reduced school lunch, food stamps (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), Medicaid (health insurance for those with low incomes), public housing, and rent subsidies.",2014-11-24T01:06:23+00:00,t1_cmb56d7,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Yes you are. Anyhow, putting that aside, the fact that some people might abuse a valuable right does not make the right less valuable.

The vast majority of Americans (like me) got their citizenship by being born here. They didn't do anything to earn or deserve it, but they got it. The 14th Amendment was passed to explicitly do away with any kind of test or distinction that would deprive some people (i.e., black people) of citizenship by setting up arbitrary criteria for who deserves it because of their parents and who doesn't because they chose the wrong parents.

Without the 14th amendment, you get a permanent underclass of non-citizens where that underclass status is passed on by birth. At the time of passage, it would have been all the freed slaves who would have been non-citizens and their children would have been non-citizens. As immigration increased, it would have been the children of Eastern or Southern Europeans, and the children of Asians.

We get enormous benefits from birthright citizenship, even if some people use (or you would say ""abuse"") it that we might think don't ""really"" qualify.

Once you set up some artificial distinction between births that count as citizens and births that don't, you've instituted the kind of discriminatory system that was explicitly *prevented* by the 14th amendment.",2020-11-21T15:45:16+00:00,t1_gd242rd,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

I laughed at her and told me she was crazy.

Then she told me of all the women she sees every day in the Western Suburbs at ballet practice, dance class, gynmastics, school functions, etc...

The ladies from Downers Grove, Glen Ellyn, Naperville- They absolutely LOVED Trump and hated Hillary.  2 of the little GEMs (Glen Ellyn Moms) clique were talking openly while at ballet with their kindergartners about how they are ecstatic that he'll get rid of the Mexicans in their schools.  (Because, yeah, there's so many Mexicans in Glen Ellyn.  I guess maybe I saw a black person once near St. Francis private High School?  But they were openly talking about that complete non-issue).  The ladies from Gymboree Wheaton hated Clinton, and the bumper stickers in the churches in Naperville had a lot of Trump.

So yeah, she sat me down and explained that she hears a ton of praise for Trump and hatred for Clinton.  And if the white, rich, educated women of the Western suburbs feel that way, just imagine how they feel in Dekalb, Decatur, or any of the 30ish counties in southern Illinois.  Now imagine how they feel in Iowa, Ohio, etc...

And it was then I realized how fucked the country was.  

And she was right.

So yeah, I've driven down Roosevelt road, I've seen the sea of yellow signs supporting Ives.  I've been on town hall calls with my rep and heard the praise for Trump.  I've gotten the Ives flyers on my door.

She's a little Trump and must be taken seriously.  I would have no surprise if this ends up being a JB-Ives win tonight (I personally think it'll be JB-Rauner, but I would have 0 surprise if Ives turns out the repugnant and wins).
