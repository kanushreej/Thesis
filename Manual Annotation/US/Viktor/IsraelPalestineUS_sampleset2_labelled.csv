Now that we've looked at the time period of 1980-2016, it's time to look at the present and the future. I'll try to stay as objective as I can in this post and mostly parrot what other turkish people around me think rather than my own opinions.

# Palestine, Israel and the Israel-Hamas War

The turkish view on this conflict has always been very complicated, because both Islam and xenophobia and racism against arabs are popular in Turkey. There are two extremes, and you will not get any answers other than these two if you ask a turkish person about this conflict. It's either ""Good, less arabs in the world"" or ""Israel are evil terrorists"".,

 With the recent Gaza Conflict, there were a lot of islamist Turks, mostly in more conservative areas, that boycotted western items, even going so far as to harass people sitting at Starbucks or drinking Cola. What that has to do with Israel, don't ask me. Meanwhile more secular turks have just stuck to ""Good, less arabs in the world"". For the future of this conflict, everyone agrees that Israel will win and keep winning, whether begrudgingly or happily.

# War in Ukraine and Russia's Future

The Ukraine War was never a big topic in Turkey, interestingly. I'm pretty much the only person I know that knows much about it. The Western view that Russia has messed up bad in this war and will never recover is denied by most Turks, as Russia is simply seen as too big and strong to fall. Most people also buy into the Russian propaganda that they're fighting NATO, not just Ukraine. Putin is seen usually as a strong and capable leader that's far more capable than any western leaders. 

Make no mistake though, Russia is still a clear enemy to Turks, as it has been for centuries. Russia is expected to eventually win, no matter how long it takes. Erdogan's policy of neutrality and trying to become the negotiator between two sides has been praised by most Turks, and even anti-Erdogan people usually say ""He's terrible at everything but good at foreign policy."".

# Sweden, Finland and NATO

As all of you probably know, on 18 May 2022, Sweden and Finland jointly applied to join NATO. Finland has been approved but Sweden still hasn't, and we even held Finland up for a long while. Why is this?  


Minor political gains for Erdogan, mostly. There is some stuff with Sweden harboring PKK terrorists but Finland really didn't do anything to us. The west has (in my opinion, rightfully) been pretty upset at Erdogan for throwing good will under the bus for some minor concessions. But most Turks think he played this well. But why?

Well, from a cold geopolitics perspective, he did. Turkey is indispensable to NATO. It is never getting kicked out. Turkey has the second largest military in NATO and is the strongest military in both the Balkans and the Middle East, while also controlling the Bosphorus, which completely checkmates Russia's strongest fleet, the Black Sea fleet. There is simply nothing the West can do other than accept Erdogan's demands as long as he doesn't go too far, and he knows it. As long as Erdogan is in charge, keep expecting these kinds of stunts.

Neoliberal,post,Israel,1bzcxpa,87568354,Trump has some deeply questionable policy positions and outright incorrect statements on his campaign website. Here’s a look at some.,"Everything quoted comes directly from Trump’s website: [https://www.donaldjtrump.com](https://www.donaldjtrump.com). In some cases, I have bolded certain statements that I take particular issue with. This isn’t about everything Trump endorses on there; I focused on what I think are the most objectionable or least coherent views.

>***Secure Borders and Reclaim National Sovereignty***  
>  
>President Donald J. Trump created the most secure border in U.S. history. He ended catch-and-release, took down human traffickers, deported record numbers of illegal alien gang members, and built 450 miles of powerful new wall. Joe Biden turned our country into one giant sanctuary for dangerous criminal aliens when he suspended all immigration enforcement in the middle of a global pandemic and reversed landmark agreements that safely returned asylum-seekers to Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. The onslaught of illegal aliens invading our wide-open borders threatens public safety, drains the treasury, undermines U.S. workers, and burdens schools and hospitals. President Trump will shut down Biden’s border disaster. He will again end catch-and-release, restore Remain in Mexico, and eliminate asylum fraud. In cooperative states, **President Trump will deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals**. He will also deliver a merit-based immigration system that protects American labor and promotes American values.

It is generally agreed on here that immigrating to the US is far harder than it should be, so I don’t believe that I have to elaborate much on why I find this section objectionable. I also don’t think it comes as a surprise for anybody that Trump once again wants to tighten the border. I suspect that empowering law enforcement to rapidly remove people will end up violating any concept of due process.

>***Renew American Strength and Leadership***

>President Donald J. Trump replaced the failed policy of never-ending war, regime change and nation-building with a bold vision to pursue peace through strength. He fully rebuilt American military might, modernized our nuclear arsenal, and launched the Space Force. **He obliterated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate**, killed its founder and leader Abu-Bakar Al Baghdadi, and eliminated the world's number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. President Trump kept America out of new wars and brought thousands of brave troops home from Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and many other countries. Joe Biden has undermined our military readiness and surrendered our strength to the Taliban. President Trump will defend America against all threats, protect America against all dangers, and keep America out of unnecessary foreign wars. He will also get Biden’s radical left ideology out of our military and rehire every patriot who was unjustly fired. To protect our people from the threat of nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles, President Trump will also build a state-of-the-art next-generation missile defense shield.

In this section, Trump seems to be advocating for a greater US presence abroad, in particular characterizing Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan as a sign of weakness and “surrendering our strength to the Taliban”, while also advocating for staying out of foreign wars. I find that to be inherently self contradictory. Also, his statement about destroying ISIS is objectively incorrect. ISIS still exists, and two of its international affiliates—IS-WAP and IS-KP—are concerning in the actions they have taken, with IS-WAP being the single biggest source of unrest and bloodshed in the Sahel, while IS-KP is not inconsiderable, as shown by their actions in Afghanistan and recent attack on a Russian concert hall, which killed over a hundred people. In short, Trump’s claim about ISIS is a blatant lie.

>***Reject Globalism and Embrace Patriotism***  
>  
>President Donald J. Trump forged international cooperation among strong, sovereign, and independent nations to create a future of peace, prosperity, and promise for the world. He combatted Radical Islamic terrorism, withdrew from the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, and suspended travel and refugee resettlement from the world’s most dangerous regions. **He recognized Israel's true capital and moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem and acknowledged Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights**. As a result of his bold diplomacy and principled realism, President Trump brokered four Middle East peace deals, collectively called the Abraham Accords, and our NATO allies agreed to pay $400 billion more in defense spending. Joe Biden’s humiliating defeat in Afghanistan has emboldened rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran that were in retreat. Under President Trump, we will restore our standing in the world and American leadership abroad.

The title of this section speaks for itself. I shouldn’t need to elaborate on why this is bad, since this sub is staunchly pro-globalist and generally understands why globalism is good. That section about Israel is the most worrying part of this section, especially in light of Israel’s conduct in their ongoing war in the Gaza Strip. The remark about “Israel’s true capital” shows that Trump has little to no respect for the UN’s attempts to establish peace in the region, suggesting that he intends to generally disregard international consensus (such as it is) on this issue. The remark about “Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights” makes it clear once again that Trump supports Israeli expansion and settlements, a position both illegal and immoral.

OK, but this completely disregards just how closely UNRWA worked with Hamas over the last 20 years. 


> Before this conflict it was not within the remit of the UNRWA to manage the security situation of the region and they wouldn’t have specialists looking on this topic. 


Some of these tunnels were literally drawing power from the UNRWA headquarters. ""The military claimed that the headquarters supplied the tunnels with electricity."" 


> Apparently Israel missed a lot of the tunneling so why would a non security agency be specifically looking for these signs.


Because Israel was not managing Gaza during this period, and had no actual oversight of Gaza during this period, except for its borders.


The UNRWA should at least be responsible for what is happening in their own headquarters, and failure to notice this is either collaboration with Hamas, or complete incompetence from the UNRWA.

This will bring the front line in direct contact with unstable Syria and its porus militarized border. Lebonon today vs 1982 is weak and crippled, its people are poor and desperate.

This could potentially draw Turkey into a military conflict, probably to a limited extent. Turkey has been fence sitting in the past, but current events can change that. There is even the possibility of Cyprus flairing up again further overextending Western military aide. 

There is the possibility of Ethiopia pursing a larger war against Eritrea, dragging itself into the Sudan conflict. This could leave Egypt in a position where it will need to pick a side which to my knowledge is a coin flip, they are concerned with their own interests, like the Saudis. 

Both Egypt and Saudi Arabia have been chasing mega projects that demand large investment and freetrade. With a collapsing freedom of movement they will destabilize. The Houthi attacks are digging their grave interupting this.

I think there is a possibility of Iran courting Qatar for a economic embargo against the West. Angola withdrawing from Opec shows a lot of internal discord. This could also trigger Venezuela into action. 
Iran could overtley puruse its intetests in an unstable Iraq sweeping up militants to its cause in an AntiIsreali Alliance. 

The Sahel states would further spill into violence, with larger scale operations especially against Nigeria pressuring Oil states across the world. Even though tbe US has ramped up its oil production it still consumes more than it produces leaving it and the EU vulnerable.

India will continue to take advantage of the chaos breaking from the West more and more into its ugly alliance of convienence with Russia.

Neoliberal,post,Israeli,1ctscwi,John3262005,"Seeking Access to Congo’s Metals, White House Aims to Ease Sanctions","Three years after Biden administration officials tightened sanctions on a billionaire Israeli mining executive for corrupt business practices in the Democratic Republic of Congo, they have reversed themselves and are offering the executive a deal they hope will bolster the supply of a metal vital to electric vehicles.

The plan would allow the executive, Dan Gertler, to sell off his remaining stakes in three giant copper and cobalt mining operations in Congo.

Those in the Biden administration pushing for the settlement deal see it as a solution to a competitive disadvantage for the United States, one that could only grow as automotive manufacturers continue to expand their production of electric vehicles. And it is in keeping with the administration’s policy positions that embrace alternative energy solutions to fossil fuels.

“To ease sanctions now seems ludicrous, giving Gertler a free pass to profit from ill-gotten gains,” said Anneke Van Woudenberg, the executive director of RAID, a nonprofit that monitors mining transactions in Congo and other countries. “The deal leaves Gertler enriched, unscathed and unaccountable — with little regard for those who matter most: the people of the D.R.C.”",2024-05-17T00:33:06+00:00,,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Geopolitics,comment,Gaza,k7q62s7,WilliamWyattD,,"Palestinians have to be second class citizens. Israel is meant to be a Jewish state. If you treated Palestinians as equals then it would become a Muslim state in time. The only solution has to be a two state one. 

I believe zionism was wrong and the original sin. And both sides behaved poorly prior to 1948. Probably not equally poorly, but I am not educated enough on the issue to adjudicate that. 

But it seems to me that post-1948, the Palestinians became weaponized by external and internal forces in a way that is hard to comprehend in the West. Increasingly, it seemed like their offer to Israel was basically 'You are intruders in our home. Leave, submit to Muslim rule again, or die.' Right or wrong in the beginning, what options have the Jews really had since then assuming just packing up and saying 'We were wrong. We took your land. We are going to give it all back.' have the Israelis had?
