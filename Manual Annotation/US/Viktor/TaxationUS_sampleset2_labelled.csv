Geopolitics,comment,tax,kp66v1v,UndividedIndecision,,"If they succeed in Ukraine, they'll probably either capture Moldova or politically strongarm it into being another puppet state like Belarus, and almost definitely solidify the Caucasus countries. 

As things stand right this second, they know they're hated for their aggression, and as easy as it is to ridicule the stupid decisions made by their military leaders, I think they know that currently a conventional war with NATO would be a complete disaster for them, and a nuclear exchange means they have nothing left to rule over. So they'll likely spend the next few years after that setting the stage for bigger moves.

Something most don't realize is that for as many men as they've stuffed into the meat-grinder, they have huge amounts of untapped manpower. Current mobilizations have been, idk what the right word is, so I'll say half-measures. As I understand it, a lot of the people being sent to the front are volunteers, prisoners, the poor, and the 'dregs' of society, with a lot of your average Russians not being sent as cannon fodder (I'm a little less knowledgeable about this aspect so take it with a grain of salt). Either way, they recognize that a full mobilization right this second would be risky as far as the unrest it would cause. So this ""setting of the stage"" over the next few years would probably consist of working to ramp up their production and logistical capabilities and allowing more military age males to come of age, as well as cultivating favorable conditions with informational warfare internally and externally to further radicalize their own population and soften their potential targets.

Internally, this means:

1. Restricting the flow of information from the outside 

2. Continuing to brainwash their populace into an 'us against the world' mindset by painting their geopolitical enemies as moral and ideological enemies (basically intensifying what they already do by calling everyone a Nazi and claiming that their bloodthirst is ordained by God)

Externally, this means:

1. Using the internet in western nations to sow internal strife and distrust (see all the 'Texan separatists' talking about warm-water ports and posting Russian flags)

2. Meddling in elections to prop up favorable candidates, particularly divisive candidates that espouse isolationist attitudes *COUGH COUGH*

3. Destabilizing collective defense alliances involving Europe by sowing distrust between allies and using the methods above to reduce American support for participation and reduce confidence that collective defense would be honored. Currently, NATO is the big one, but if they're able to effectively remove the threat of American intervention from the equation, they'd probably work on doing the same to weaken the EU's Common Security and Defense policy. If they're successful here, they may try testing the waters by encroaching on the Baltics or something, but I think it's unlikely unless they're able to turn the entire West into a squabbling brawl. Their propaganda is effective, but idk about it being *that* effective.

There are some wild-cards that could delay or expedite further aggression, though, and there's no telling if they'll happen and how they'll affect it (from my own perspective at least. I'm sure there are some people that have valid insight)

1. The US election results. If a candidate is elected that is less concerned with curbing Russian aggression, they might take the window.

2. Even if that candidate is elected, we now have something signed into place to prevent the president from pulling out of NATO. Even so, we can't say for sure that said administration won't just say ""eh, whatever"" and just not honor Article 5 in the event that it's triggered. Again, someone might have better insight on that one than me.

3. Putin's health and age. Some see that he's getting old and think he doesn't have long left in power before he dies or retires. Some think he'll live another 25 years and won't leave until the day he dies, heaven forbid. A despot with little time left is more likely to act in a way we'd think of as irresponsible or dangerous.",2024-02-06T13:01:46+00:00,t3_1ak7qli,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
PoliticalDiscussion,comment,income tax,gqd153j,jbphilly,,">Were you laid off? Yes or No, if yes, then the government will help pay that bill if you show that you were laid off or suffered a loss of income. 

Again, you keep saying this as if we can make a magic wand and it all just kind of *happens.*

But I've already described why in practice it isn't that simple. You just chose to ignore all that because your fantasy of how you'd like this to work crashed into reality.

As soon as you begin testing who is telling the truth and who is lying, you would need a sizeable government workforce to do that job, along the lines of IRS auditors. They would need to be making case by case decisions about *every single person who received this form of assistance.* That's tens of millions of people. That means a huge number of government employees that have to do the job of checking each of their cases to detect the liars.

And then what about when someone's case is unclear, and the government auditors deny their claim, but it later comes to light that the person was absolutely correct and deserved the benefits? You have to spend *even more* time correcting everything and making it right, and you have to potentially deal with lawsuits from people claiming they were denied benefits for discriminatory reasons. So now a bunch of government lawyers have to be paid to deal with this in court.

You could very easily end up with a case where you spend far more money paying all those employees, and settling those lawsuits, than you end up collecting from the fraudsters you detected. **Is that a worthwhile use of government money?** That's one of the fundamental answers I'm trying to pry out of you here.

Again, it's very obvious that what you're really preoccupied with is catching ""thieves"", not with practicalities of implementing a policy. I'm just making the point here that people's knee-jerk obsession with making sure nobody ever gets any benefit they don't deserve is unreasonable and destructive, given all the costs and collateral damage involved in making that happen.",2021-03-09T19:13:50+00:00,t1_gqcyost,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,tax,gmnsr2e,goettahead,,"I don’t think you are asking the right question. MMT as far as I understand it (one book and some YouTube) would argue that it is already the monetary system, we just aren’t recognizing it because it’s too politically risky to talk that in public. In fact, Greenspan himself has acknowledged this very system at a fundamental level (not political role) while testifying in Congress. Many government reps and wonks know about or at least acknowledge it’s existence and possible truth. 

But to answer what I think you are asking which how do you start implementing a new understanding? I think we would start with a national discussion about what areas of the economy have ‘slack’ to invest, are small and not vital to the overall economy and where inflation is less risky early on. To pilot the philosophy in practice.

I would also submit that once the language changes how we describe the system it will do more to fully bring about the new system which itself would be revolutionary but obvious at the same time. We would think about the monetary system differently, not describe it in household terms and use different concepts and language overall. 

We would also need to revise stale economic metrics like The Unemployment Rate and some others to properly measure the true causes and effects of spending and inflation and by function learn how to manage their ‘dance’ better. 

In a way the testing today will dictate how it rolls out but I think it’s coming. It’s really how it works.",2021-02-09T03:46:38+00:00,t3_lfrqxl,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Anyway, I know it's annoying with Sanders in particular because so much hinges on the specifics of his plan and I'm all for seeing more details but (in my opinion) the more radical statements of all the candidates have gone unsupported so he's kind of par for the course there.

PoliticalDiscussion,post,taxation,17m2fj,DistortionMage,Lets examine the reasoning behind some core liberal/left-wing beliefs. ,"I am left-leaning in my sentiments, but I often feel that those of us on the left don't subject our views to enough serious criticism. With the great majority of the right-wing in the US being such intellectual lightweights, its easy to feel secure in our viewpoints. A kind of arrogant, unfounded confidence is the result. Stop congratulating yourselves for being better than conservative Republicans like Palin, Bush, and Limbaugh - that's not much of an accomplishment. In the absence of a worthy opponent, you have to play devil's advocate. Strive for the highest level of intellectual rigor possible (Now I don't claim to represent that level of rigor, but at least I'm trying).

All left viewpoints need to be re-examined from a rational, critical viewpoint. I think a major one is the kind of faith and trust in the goodness and efficiency of government. And there are many sacred cows about government that leftists refuse to question. If you do, you must hate the poor or be a racist or something. Lets question some of these sacred cows. 

Some examples: Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, and safety net programs. Together, these account for 54% of the Federal budget. Liberals defend these to the death against attacks from conservatives who want to privatize or eliminate them. They are just as inflexible and unreasonable as conservatives who refuse to compromise on military spending. Just as conservatives need to rethink their commitment to the military-industrial complex, liberals need to rethink their commitment to the government entitlement complex. Instead of attacking these programs from the right, I want to attack them from the left. 

Now I am far from an expert on Social Security, but to me, it seems like an absurd, misleading, and unnecessarily complicated system. How about we guarantee an income of $2000/month to all retirees who have less than, lets say, $1 million in assets? (well, scaled down benefits gradually to avoid a sharp cutoff). And instead of taxing all workers/employers 15%, make it instead a sharply progressive tax? DO NOT make income above $100k exempt from Social Security tax. Instead, tax at an even higher rate. Tax the average worker at a lower rate. If you are a millionaire, you pay into the system but you do not benefit from it. They can deal with it. Make it more explicitly a form of welfare, and steadfastly defend it. Liberals in the US are constantly playing the defensive against the right. Instead of pretending you don't advocate welfare, implicitly accepting the moral critiques from the right, proudly advocate it. That's what the right does. They are proof that even crazy beliefs can gain widespread acceptance if you actually stand up for them. 

Actually I believe that many problems can be solved by simply redistributing income. There is no need for a massive government apparatus. You can actually have a small, lean government that doesn't do much besides redistribute. Why have a minimum wage? Just redistribute from the rich to guarantee a minimum income for workers. Why have universal health care? Just redistribute from the rich so that the poor can afford private healthcare. Why have food stamps? Just redistribute so that the poor can afford food. 

As for the moral hazard problem, just make these benefits tied to working, kinda like the Earned Income Tax Credit. For each dollar a low-wage worker earns from his job, he will get say, $1 from a rich person. 

Instead of unemployment insurance, the government should organize massive projects that benefit the public, essentially employing any unemployed person who wants to work. They just have to be careful to pay less than what the worker would earn in a real job, so there is an incentive to get a real job. But even if workers stay ""employed"" by the government in this fashion, at least they're doing something useful right? The government can also provide time for these workers to look for real jobs, where they are paid a certain amount for each application sent, for example. 

It's a technical challenge to deal with the moral hazard problem, but I believe it can be done. 

Perhaps though, even redistribution from rich to poor is a sacred cow that needs to be questioned (although it is kind of the foundation of leftist economic beliefs). Redistribution assumes that the rich will stay put and allow their money to be taken. But in an increasingly globalized world, what's to stop them from shuffling around their assets to low-tax countries to avoid taxation? What's to stop them from actually leaving your country and moving to a low-tax country? There is enormous pressure to lower taxes to attract business to your country. A taxation race to the bottom. It seems like you need a global, coordinated effort if you want to pin down the rich long enough to tax them. 

Why, indeed, must there be this reliance on government as the savior, saving us from impoverishment by acting as Robin Hood, stealing from the rich to give to the poor? What if, instead, we coordinated our efforts independent from government and actually helped each other out? Volunteering our time and money to help your fellow human beings? We are becoming increasingly isolated individualists, cut off from any kind of real community or network of support. That's the root of the problem, isn't it, selfish individualism? Why do we need government in order to act selflessly and help out those in need? Just a thought. 

Now, what other liberal/left sacred cows am I leaving out? I'm sure there's quite a few.

Conservatives,post,sales tax,188rz3k,Head_Estate_3944,"Mexican drug cartel operators posed as U.S. officials to target Americans in timeshare scam, Treasury Department says","A Mexican drug cartel was so bold in operating frauds that target elderly Americans that the gang's operators posed as U.S. Treasury Department officials, U.S. authorities said Thursday.

The scam was described by the department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. The agency has been chasing fraudsters using call centers controlled by the Jalisco drug cartel to promote fake offers to buy Americans' timeshare properties. They have scammed at least 600 Americans out of about $40 million, officials said.

But they also began contacting people claiming to be employees of OFAC itself, and offering to free up funds purportedly frozen by the U.S. agency, which combats illicit funds and money laundering.

""At times, perpetrators of timeshare fraud misuse government agency names in attempts to appear legitimate,"" the agency said. ""For example, perpetrators may call victims and claim to represent OFAC, demanding a payment in exchange for the release of funds that the perpetrator claims OFAC has blocked.""

Officials have said the scam focused on Puerto Vallarta, in Jalisco state. In an alert issued in March, the FBI said sellers were contacted via email by scammers who said they had a buyer lined up, but the seller needed to pay taxes or other fees before the deal could go through.

""The sales representatives often use high-pressure sales tactics to add a sense of urgency to the deal,"" the FBI said.

Apparently, once the money was paid, the deals evaporated.

OFAC announced a new round of sanctions Thursday against three Mexican citizens and 13 companies they said are linked to the Jalisco cartel, known by its Spanish initials as the CJNG, which has killed call center workers who try to quit.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said in the statement that ""CJNG uses extreme violence and intimidation to control the timeshare network, which often targets elder U.S. citizens and can defraud victims of their life savings.""

The Jalisco cartel is better known for producing millions of doses of deadly fentanyl and smuggling them into the United States disguised to look like Xanax, Percocet or oxycodone. Such pills cause about 70,000 overdose deaths per year in the United States.

""Treasury remains committed to the Administration's whole-of-government effort, in coordination with our partners in Mexico, to disrupt CJNG's revenue sources and ability to traffic deadly drugs like fentanyl,"" Yellen said.

In June, U.S. and Mexican officials confirmed that as many as eight young Mexican workers were confirmed dead after they apparently tried to quit jobs at a call center operated by the Jalisco cartel.

While the victims' families believed their children worked at a normal call center, the office was in fact run by Jalisco, Mexico's most violent gang.

The Department of Justice has called the Jalisco cartel ""one of the five most dangerous transnational criminal organizations in the world."" The cartel's leader, Nemesio Oseguera, aka ""El Mencho,"" is among the most sought by Mexican and U.S. authorities.",2023-12-02T01:18:33+00:00,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

I learned this during the height of the pandemic when the consensus here was that masks and vaccines were antithetical to libertarianism. As a physician I had to take a step back and realize that individual rights and liberties take a back seat when viruses infect people on a global scale. According to libertarianism, if you as a lib make healthcare decisions that go against what benefits society and you end up dying from it then that fine.

Again, look up your facts. Romney didn't start Bain. He was hired by Bain based on his performance at HLS and HBS. Then, after the company was about to go under, he was made CEO and saved it and all its employees' jobs. Then, because of his success, when they created Bain Capital, they asked him to run it. 

> I think you may have a poor perception of exactly how much money and a good family name buys you at all points in your life. Money matters growing up with access to opportunities, in college and grad school with the economic freedom and connections, and when you're starting a firm that does investment capital, and when you're running for public office.

Can you point to where his father's connections mattered? Did his father buy him the grades at BYU that made him valedictorian? Did his dad buy his stellar grades at HBS and HLS? His dad (who didn't go to college) was not part of the Harvard old boys' network; Romney's own grades got him in. His grades there got him his gig at Bain. His success at Bain got him promoted and, eventually, put in charge of Bain Capital.

Healthcare,post,income tax,2xfhbq,Comp625,"Under Capitalism, will the U.S. *ever* reduce the cost of healthcare?","I think the answer is ""No"" as long as the economic system is driven by capitalism.

* Despite being healthcare providers, Doctors & Hospitals are still businesses. Just like any business, the goal is to maximize profit and make money while ensuring that their income stream can accommodate for staffing, utilities, medical supplies, employee insurance, professional insurance, etc.
* Pharmaceuticals still need to spend millions of dollars on R&D. Lots of drugs are researched but later scrapped. The knowledge is obtained but the dollars are lost.
* Without tort reform, medical providers remain too exposed toward lawsuits. Even if the chance of losing a lawsuit is unlikely, dollars are wasted on hiring lawyers for protection along with the consistent high-cost of professional liability insurance. 
* Insurance premiums and fees continue to increase. The irony is that the ACA laws actually increased premiums and fees (through additional taxes, for instance). Plus, insurance premiums will continue to rise until all of the aforementioned costs are controlled. 
* High-Deductible insurance plans meant to encourage healthcare consumerism backfires since many folks are unable to pay their responsibilities (Deductible & Coinsurance). This has caused medical providers to raise their fees to compensate for the money lost from unpaid dues. 
* The cost of medical devices and supplies continue to increase as technology and material/manufacturing costs increase themselves. 
* American attitudes toward health have improved over the years, but society itself has to adapt to better ways of living. For instance, unhealthy foods remain cheaper than healthier alternatives forcing people to gravitate toward them for cost & convenience.
* Fraud, waste, and intentional gouging are all critical concerns. This is tricky since our society has a tendency of over-testing/over-servicing patients, yet, it's equally problematic to question a doctor's orders.
* Mental Health is a very important aspect of healthcare, but it is another very subjective area of high-cost healthcare. 
* Other aspects of society have indirect but significant impacts on the cost of healthcare. For instance, the cost of education continues to skyrocket forcing less people to pursue a clinical degree in fear of eternal debt.

Even under a single-payor system (""Universal Healthcare""), all of the aforementioned issues remain problematic as high-cost drivers in healthcare. Americans would essentially pay for these problems through the tax code rather than through their paychecks.

That said, as a Democrat, and more broadly as a liberal, I like to hear as many opinions, ideas, and solutions on a problem as possible, even if those ideas happen to come from conservatives.  (God help me, but if Louie Gohmert has an idea that can *actually* help us stop global warming, let's hear him out.)  Thing is that the vast majority of right-wing media is fantasy, drug riddled immigrants reelecting Nancy Pelosi with the power of Satan, that kind of crap, stuff that cannot possibly help us solve real world problems because the problems they're talking about aren't actually real.  
  
Financial papers are a *little bit* better, because they're not based on imaginary stuff.  Now to be fair, you'll still get a lot of really stupid opinions, y'know: 

>""Yes immigrants create a great amount of economic stimulus and contribute to tax revenues and second generation immigrants create more jobs than any other demographic in America, but we should still build a thirty seven foot tall border wall with turret mounted flame throwers armed by rabid alligator mutants.""  
  
But once in a while you'll get somebody saying yeah, maybe a carbon tax isn't the worst idea in the world, and hey, austerity isn't the greatest thing for the American economy, and no, the unemployment level didn't switch back to 97% on the day President Biden was inaugurated, and fact based takes can be useful, if for no other reason than it's good to hear things someone like us might not immediately think of.

While the demand for the product is highly inelastic among *current* users, higher costs can make picking up the habit prohibitive to *potential* users.  Particularly since most people begin smoking when they are young and less financially secure. 

Being well aware of this, tobacco companies likely kept their costs somewhat lower than optimal in the short run, in order to maintain their customer base.  Alternatively, governments were able to exploit this in order to acquire the tax dollars to pay for all the lung cancer smoking has caused, as well as reduce the adoption rate of smoking.

Furthermore, an outright ban would not have netted anywhere close to the tax revenue that marginally increase taxation has. 

Although I have to say, this is an very unique situation where an objectively harmful and addictive substance has been abused for centuries. We needed to find a way to curb its abuse, but at the same time did not want to completely eliminate it.  More on topic with this thread, I do not believe we will see taxes on anything that is subjectively ""bad,"" such as a Catholic president mandating a tax on Mormon bibles.

At a basic level, it seems unfair for me, a healthy individual who drives 5,000 miles a year and has no kids, to have to pay taxes to support, for instance, a truck driver who smokes and has three kids in public school.

However, I feel that paying taxes for these services amounts to a net benefit for society in the long term.  The more healthy and educated our workforce becomes, the more knowledge we create, and our nation (and planet) are benefited accordingly.  

My current dilemma is whether it is a better benefit to society to use our tax dollars to support cutting edge technology and infrastructure such as space exploration and CERN or to bring knowledge to the uneducated masses?  

The former is much more expensive and may take decades to create an appreciable benefit to society (e.g. the internet).  The latter can benefit many people and at a lower cost (e.g. a library); however, there is a progress ceiling in that we cannot teach something we haven't yet discovered.
