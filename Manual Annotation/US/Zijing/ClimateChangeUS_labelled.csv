PoliticalDiscussion,comment,CO2,ccr3hhv,virnovus,,"> It's irresponsible to conclude anything from that graph beyond ""CO2 and Heat both exist on the planet at once, throughout history"".

I found the graph quickly by using Google, but it does use data that comes from fairly reliable sources.  The CO2 data is somewhat more reliable and accurate than the temperature data though.  CO2 levels are approximately the same everywhere on Earth, so geological records will be consistent.  This is not true for temperature data.

> Human contribution to the greenhouse gas effect is direct when we make emissions, but we also contribute indirectly through deforestation, limiting biodiversity, reseting ecological succession, over-fishing, killing bees, creating monocultures, etc. etc. However your question is unanswerable. Science is a great tool but cannot pick out one multifaceted variable (human activity) and predict it's effect in a global biological system.

We do know that the Earth has been warming since the last ice age, with little human interference until recently.  And you are right that it's difficult to come up with an accurate scientific model, but I don't think it's totally impossible.

> This is thoroughly possible mostly through leap frogging. The technology is there; the political/economic will isn't there for many well known reasons.

Not really.  Solar panels and wind turbines will never power farm equipment, tractor trailers, airplanes, or container ships.  We need some energy source for these things, and very few feasible solutions have been posed.  Personally, I think we'd be able to run container ships with thorium-based nuclear reactors if we had to, similar to how we run military ships now, but you're right about the political will not being there. New Zealand won't even let nuclear-powered ships dock in its ports, for example.

> I must admit in all my time spent researching and learning about these things, you don't hear many scientists saying there is a benefit to climate change. this article epitomizes the general consensus about the likely effects global warming will have on humans. You're right though, some places will see better climate (canada etc.)

Yeah, that article is so full of fear tactics that it's hard to learn anything from it.  There are massive tracts of arable land all over the world that would become much better for agriculture in the event of higher CO2 levels and warmer global temperatures.  If you're a global warming activist, it's easy to overlook this fact, but it's still a bit dishonest.

> I guess most people are more concerned with the millions who are/will be displaced or killed by continued fossil fuel use.

Being displaced is a hell of a lot better than being killed.  People move all the time when job opportunities open up elsewhere.  I don't really see global warming killing anybody, other than maybe people dying of starvation in larger numbers than before due to droughts or whatever.  But people are always dying of starvation anyway, and droughts have existed since biblical times.

> I was following you up until ""Increase in plant mass."" There is no increase in plant mass. We are experiencing what many scientists are calling another extinction period currently; deserts are expanding while rain forests are dwindling.

Not really true.  Plants need CO2 to grow.  Adding CO2 to the atmosphere is actually helpful to most species of plant life.  Read this article, it's quite interesting:

I’ve heard this defense of ICE tech and I’m trying to get my head around the feasibility of this idea. To make sense, wouldn’t comparison have to focus mainly on emissions to produce just the EV instead of non-EV components (since creating ICE vehicles also creates emissions)? To be feasible, assuming the vehicles have similar lifetimes, (emissions to produce battery+motor) minus (emissions to produce ICE components) would have to be more than (lifetime emissions of new 1/2 EV ice vehicle). I’m not saying emissions to build a giant lithium battery is insignificant. But I’m struggling to imagine any ICE tech that would emit less in its entire lifetime.

I’d recommend, I say this with the utmost respect and in good faith, that you do you own research into firearms and nuances that come with it. You’d be surprised what you find out with a little reading that isn’t Reddit or news article related. 

It should also be noted that the AR style rifle was originally produced for civilian hunting purposes in the 1950s.

Also I realized I never addressed the Assault weapon question. No they are not technically defined as an Assault weapon.

Other interesting phenomena besides just cooling:   
1) Weaker solar cycles weaken the Jet stream so we get more unstable weather - snowstorms, floods, etc.    
2) The decreased solar winds allow more cosmic radiation to hit the planet so it's believed there could be an increase in high-level volcanic activity.

PoliticalDiscussion,post,climate change,43wpbt,Thresser,I'm very surprised by Cruz winning yesterday...,"Yesterday was pretty entertaining and had some surprising results.  Trump didn't win, Rubio was so close to 2nd, Carson got way more votes than I would have expected, Bush did worse than Rand by a factor of almost 2, and the neck and neck with Clinton/Sanders was definitely unexpected for me.

However what I don't understand is how Cruz could win and win by  3%.  Either I'm out of touch with a huge segment of Americans or people are not reading up on the issues.   Cruz is an extremist by most measures and it makes no sense that so many would support him.  He seems to be pandering to people but are there really that many that can be bought with his policies?  Enough to win the Presidency?  It's amazing enough to me that he could win a Caucus.  Would he have lost if there were less candidates?

Some of the more radical ideas he has:

* Get rid of the departments of energy, education, commerce, and housing and urban development.
* Get rid of the IRS and do a 10% flat tax
* End corporate income tax and replace it with a 16% VAT
* End the Iran Nuclear deal, increase sanctions on them, and make the sanctions tougher.
* Start carpet bombing the middle east to get ISIL.  This is a war crime according to the Geneva Conventions.  He has called for airstrikes with less concern for civilian casualties as well.
* Is open to a ground invasion in the middle east to attack ISIL
* He opposes net neutrality
* Repeal Obamacare.  His alternative would not cover pre-existing conditions.
* Opposes same sex marriage and wants only those 4 states mentioned in the ruling to abide by the law with the other 46 ignoring the law.
* Opposes equal rights for transgender Americans.
* He wants the Supreme court to be elected and have term limits.
* He opposes a woman's right to choose and wants planned parenthood defunded.
* Is a climate change denier.
* Opposes the separation of church and state

It's impossible to say something like ""we don't have the data that far back"" with a span like this, and since it's local, it's likely the person witnessed these droughts first hand so they can't deny the data.

IE what might be a good salary in a little coal town would be lower class somewhere like Lexington and when you have to add in the fact that if they moved there, they'd have to take an even lower paying job, you begin to understand why these people are willing to fight tooth and nail to keep the coal mines and other nonrenewable  resource harvesting open no matter the cost to the environment or anyone else. Its a really dynamic problem.

The answer can't simply be ""build it"". 

For example, Florida cities are limited in height due to the ground conditions (and the FAA in Miami.. but it's already going underwater so who cares?). Historically things have developed very far apart since land was cheap. Actual downtown Orlando/Tampa are basically pointless, few people work there and the layouts aren't conducive to walking or even bus routes really since ridership would be so low in many areas. Essentially the cities would need to entice businesses to move to centers or clusters and then radically alter the residential zones since they are sprawling messes too. 

Problem is companies aren't moving to Florida for their city centers, they are coming here for cheap labor and low taxes. Orlando and Tampa have a hard time convincing them to open up downtown when the surrounding counties offer stupid incentives. The cost of land/rent is high, recruiting people to work in the city is harder, etc.

I’m right on the verge of beginning busy carbon emitter work after getting my head around the issues of carbon in energy supplies and transportation and food and heating/cooling as they were. Can you TLDR; the article?

Actually, I read it. Well worded and insightful. Skip the TLDR as the perspective was short and easily understood. 

How does sea level rise only get a $2? 

Has anyone ever relocated a city including all buried and surface materials to ensure or enable a clean base for sea shores and future fisheries and fish hatcheries or fish nurseries or coral reefs migrating inland? 

I guess the question there is, what’s the sea level rise height at the 300 yr predicted outlook that suggests today the price is $2 per tonne for the sea level cost components of the $160?

Which begs the question, given the fastest inundation will be globally simultaneously (assuming many tipping points are hit earlier and cause premature rises at faster speeds) is $2 enough of a set $160 penalty to bank into some ethical investment to cover the costs of disassembly of all cities and housing facing inundation, as well as the removal of all materials items subject to the rising seas, to maintain health ocean habitats at the boundaries of atmosphere/ocean/land? 

It seems suspiciously low to me, that $2 component. 

What if it was retained and invested into an ‘earth wide sovereign global wealth fund’, would it pay to cover the land costs of the inundation areas alone, not talking of removal of buildings and urban, suburban and rural or farming coastal infrastructure, or the inland equivalent considering water table changes making much larger amounts of land unusable given the typical effect of, I think, salts rising to damage soils from a lack of deep plant root (flora) cover that acts as a moisture wick (transpiration) or evaporator keeping sodium chloride from damaging topsoil in the broader agricultural food production regions near current sea level heights where the water table presently is low enough that salt migration to the surface is reduced? 

I suggest no, but I am not looking at any numbers, instead I’m haphazardly guessing. 

I’d love to see some GIS layers that have better resolution than the typical sea level flood data, which lets one do financial planning with typical bank loan periods, or leasehold periods, as I assume there’s many banks (even crypto markets) who are lending for housing or for agriculture which need to work with governments to try find ways to compensate people globally for land loss where debt is due and any sale has occurred that didn’t make explicitly clear that freehold was temporary or that the leasehold was for land likely to become unusable except as mangrove swamp or fish habitat or tidal floodplain or as forested brackish wetland or as ‘seagrass habitats or coral reef rainfall catchment area with slow land-based filtration rather than rapid runoff involving topsoil loss or silting that’s less supportive of the most diverse and healthy species at the newly inundated areas’.",2023-01-21T08:18:52+00:00,t3_10h0ki3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

The U.S. State Department said Thursday it is partnering with the Mexican government to seek opportunities for expanding and diversifying chip development. The partnership will be powered by the International Technology Security and Innovation (ITSI) fund, a cash pile that comes from the CHIPS and Science Act passed by the Biden administration in 2022. The new collaboration “will help create a more resilient, secure, and sustainable global semiconductor value chain,” the State Department said in a statement.

During the partnership’s first phase, Mexico will assess its existing semiconductor ecosystem, as well as its regulatory framework, workforce, and infrastructure needs. Mexico’s state governments, academics, researchers, and companies will work with the Secretariat of Economy — Mexico’s federal economic and financial agency — in the review. The assessment will allow the two nations to determine potential joint initiatives in the future. Neither the U.S. State Department nor Mexico’s Secretariat of Economy immediately responded to a request for comment on the partnership.

“The United States and Mexico are key partners in ensuring the global semiconductor supply chain keeps pace with the digital transformation underway worldwide,” the U.S. State Department said in a statement. “This collaboration between the United States and Mexico underscores the significant potential to expand Mexico’s semiconductor industry to the benefit of both nations and will build on existing cooperation under the bilateral High-Level Economic Dialogue and trilateral North American Leaders Summit process.”

While this marks the first international partnership under the CHIPS Act, the United States has already poured billions into semiconductor production — but to American tech companies. The latest in CHIPS-sponsored announcements is an $8.5 billion investment in semiconductor manufacturer Intel. To accompany the funding, the chipmaker has said it plans to invest over $100 billion over the next five years to expand U.S. semiconductor manufacturing with sites in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon.",2024-03-30T05:24:34+00:00,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,climate change,i861s1b,NormalCampaign,,"No, I don't think this would be a good idea. Without a doubt there are plenty of politically engaged and knowledgeable 16 year olds, and on the other hand plenty of adults that don't have a clue. But there are also some politically astute 14 year olds out there, and even a few 12 year olds. Unless we require a knowledge test to vote, which would be a terrible idea, an arbitrary line has to be drawn somewhere. Setting it at 18, and making the right to vote a mark of legal adulthood, makes the most amount of sense to me.

Even as someone who was politically engaged at 16, looking back in hindsight I don't think my peers and I voting would have been a good idea. There's a big difference between being factually knowledgeable about political topics and actually understanding them. 16 year olds aren't exactly known for nuanced thinking. Often the people pushing for this idea seem to assume lowering the voting age would lead to a big boost in progressive voters – which it probably would – but my concern is these very young voters would be extremely vulnerable to simplistic and populist rhetoric of all kinds. As an anecdotal example of what I mean, I remember back in my high school civics class we did a few classroom polls on different topics and there was near-unanimous support for the death penalty.

You're correct that some of the arguments used to oppose women's suffrage were similar, but that isn't a very convincing argument, it just makes it sound like you're suggesting women are mentally comparable to teenagers – which I'm sure wasn't your intention, but it's the unfortunate implication.",2022-05-11T10:41:39+00:00,t3_un2kh1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

The consensus among [scientists](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economists](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) on [carbon pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price)^§ to mitigate climate change is similar to [the consensus among climatologists](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) that human activity is responsible for global warming. Putting the price [upstream](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658) where the fossil fuels enter the market makes it simple, easily enforceable, and bureaucratically lean. Returning the revenue as an equitable dividend [offsets the regressive effects of the tax](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9152.pdf) (in fact, [~60% of the public would receive more in dividend than they paid in tax](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648#s7)) and allows for a higher carbon price (which [is what matters for climate mitigation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S201000781840002X)) because [the public isn't willing to pay anywhere near what's needed otherwise](http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/Is-the-Public-Willing-to-Pay-to-Help-Fix-Climate-Change-.aspx). Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own.

[Conservative estimates](http://rdcu.be/cLYO) are that failing to mitigate climate change will cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years, [starting about now](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In contrast, carbon taxes may actually *boost* GDP, if the revenue is [returned as an equitable dividend to households](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy) (the [poor tend to spend money when they've got it](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC.pdf), which [boosts economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)).

Taxing carbon [is in each nation's own best interest](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15105.pdf), and [many nations have already started](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/29687/9781464812927.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y). We [won’t wean ourselves off fossil fuels without a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224), the [longer we wait to take action the more expensive it will be](http://rdcu.be/cZjG). Each year we delay costs [~$900 billion](https://cla.umn.edu/heller-hurwicz/news-events/news/policy-brief-calibrating-price-climate-risk).
 
[It's the smart thing to do](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069698910580). And the IPCC report made clear [pricing carbon is **necessary** if we want to meet our 1.5 ºC target](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf).

[The U.S. could induce other nations to enact mitigation policies by enacting one of our own](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). Contrary to [popular belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples) the main barrier isn't lack of public support; in fact, a majority in [every congressional district](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2018/?est=reducetax&type=value&geo=cd) and [each political party](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf) supports a carbon tax, which [does help our chances of passing meaningful legislation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2016.1116651). But [we can't keep hoping others will solve this problem for us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility). *[We](https://i.redd.it/tomv8cnadxa11.jpg)* need to take the necessary steps to make this dream a reality:

1. [**Vote**](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sign-the-pledge). People who prioritize climate change and the environment [have not been very reliable voters, which explains much of the lackadaisical response of lawmakers](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/news/millions-environmentalists-are-registered-vote-us-dont-what-if-they-did), and many Americans don't realize we should be voting (on average) [in 3-4 elections per year](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/news/millions-environmentalists-are-registered-vote-us-dont-what-if-they-did). In 2018 in the U.S., the percentage of voters prioritizing the environment [more than tripled](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/green/A-Green-Wave-Signs-Point-to-Voters-Demanding-Action-on-Climate-Change-502796391.html), and now [climate change is a priority issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal) for lawmakers. Even if you don't like any of the candidates or live in a 'safe' district, [**whether or not you vote is a matter of public record**](https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/april-may-june-2018/planet-earth-gets-a-ground-game/), and **[it's fairly easy to figure out if you care about the environment or climate change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U&t=2m53s)**. Politicians [use this information](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00357.x) to prioritize agendas. Voting in every election, even the minor ones, [will raise the profile and power of your values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U&t=2m53s). If you don't [vote](https://voteclimatepac.org/voters-guide/), you and your values can safely be ignored.

2. [**Lobby**](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-CarbonTax&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=CarbonTax). [Lobbying works](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/friends_or_foes-how_social_movement_allies_affect_the_passage_of_legislation_in_the_u._s._congress.pdf), and you [don't need a lot of money to be effective](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41759323?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) (though it does help to [educate yourself on effective tactics](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf)). If you're too busy to go through the [free training](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/new-member/#climateadvocatetraining), sign up for [text alerts](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/text/) to join coordinated call-in days ([it works](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf)) or set yourself a monthly reminder to [write a letter](https://www.ted.com/talks/omar_ahmad_political_change_with_pen_and_paper?language=en) to your elected officials.

3. [**Recruit**](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/communications/). Most of us are [either alarmed or concerned](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Six-Americas-Februrary-2019.png) about climate change, yet most aren't taking [the necessary steps](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) to solve the problem -- the [most common reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6DoiQM_-is) is that no one asked. If all of us who are ['very worried'](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/03/21/worries-priorities-and-potential-problem-solvers/) about climate change organized we would be >26x more powerful than the NRA. According to [Yale data](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-May-2017.pdf), many of your friends and family would welcome the opportunity to get involved if you just asked. So please [volunteer](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/get-involved) or [donate](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/donate) to turn out environmental voters, and invite your friends and family to [lobby Congress](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-CarbonTax&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=CarbonTax).

§ The IPCC (AR5, WGIII) [Summary for Policymakers](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) states with ""high confidence"" that tax-based policies are effective at decoupling GHG emissions from GDP (see p. 28). [Ch. 15](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf) has a more complete discussion. The U.S. [National Academy of Sciences, one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world, has also called for a carbon tax](https://www.nap.edu/download/21712). According to [IMF research](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/how-much-does-world-subsidize-oil-coal-and-gas/589000/), most of the $5.2 trillion in subsidies for fossil fuels come from not taxing carbon as we should. There is general agreement among economists on carbon taxes whether you consider [economists with expertise in climate economics](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf), [economists with expertise in resource economics](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&rep=rep1&type=pdf), or [economists from all sectors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doris_Geide-Stevenson/publication/261884738_Consensus_Among_Economists-An_Update/links/56a7f3fa08ae860e0255a8e3.pdf).

And, for most of us, convenience is more important than ""doing our part."" It's really just an excuse that we tell ourselves to justify perpetual indulgence.

The other excuse is ""it has to be government because the majority just won't do it"" -- and this is partially right. But the paradox is that governments won't legislate sustainability in any meaningful way until it proves prosperous and widely adopted. As long as sustainable living is a ""fringe"" lifestyle, it's not ""important"" enough from a governance perspective. It can only get to that point if people willingly adopt it, so those who say ""governments must be legislate first"" are their own biggest hurdle. It's very much a catch-22. But, again, it's not really a reason not to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle -- it's just an excuse and a way that we shift the responsibility to someone else so we feel less bad about being part of the problem.

Don't get me wrong -- we've sacrificed greatly to be more sustainable: we haven't owned a car in three years, we live a virtually zero-waste lifestyle, and we're very conscious consumers. It's not easy... it's very difficult, requires giving up a lot of convenience and luxuries we've taken for granted, and comes with a higher price tag. And all the while you know that your efforts, alone, are not enough so you keep hoping (against all odds) that tomorrow is the day everyone else gets on-board.
