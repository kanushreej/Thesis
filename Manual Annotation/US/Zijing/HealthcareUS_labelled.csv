If all counties were equally populated this would have more significance I believe.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,hospital,ccr0b8s,pointyhorcruxes,,"Heard someone recently say that volcanoes produce more CO2 than humans. Came here to dispel that myth. 

2 C8H18(l) + 25 02 (g) -----> 16 CO2 (g) + 18 H20 (g)

For every 2 molecules of octane burned 16 molecules of Carbon Dioxide are produced. 

U.S. Department of Energy states the world burned 3.1x10^10 barrels of petroleum in 2007. This is the equivalent to approx. 3.5x10^15 g of gasoline. 

To find the amount in grams of CO2 this produces we can use stoichiometry and mass to mass conversions. 

3.5x10^15 ~~g C8H18~~ x 1~~mol C8H18~~/114.22~~g C8H18~~ x 16~~mol CO2~~/2~~mol C8H18~~ x 44.01g CO2/1~~mol CO2~~ = 1.1 x 10^16 g CO2

This says in everyday people terms:

You take the amount of gasoline burned (3.5x10^15) and divide it by octane's molar mass (114.22) 
>
3.5x10^15 ~~g C8H18~~ x 1~~mol C8H18~~/114.22~~g C8H18~~


you take that number and then multiply it by the stoichiometry of CO2 to C8H18 which is a 8:1 ratio
>x 16~~mol CO2~~/2~~mol C8H18~~

Then you multiply that number by the molar mass of CO2 to get your answer in grams
> x 44.01g CO2/1~~mol CO2~~ = 1.1 x 10^16 g CO2


Volcanoes emit 2.0 x 10^11 kg CO2 per year so:

2.0 x 10^11 Kg CO2/1.1 x 10^13 Kg x 100 = 1.8% as much CO2 per year as petroleum. 

Too long, don't understand chemistry?

Volcanoes don't emit more CO2 than humans use of fossil fuels. 

Why is this important?

CO2 is not a bad gas, contrary to what many people think. What is bad is *too much* CO2. CO2 is the reason the average temperature of Earth is not 60 degrees cooler than what it normally is. CO2 allows the heat from the suns rays to stay comfortably tucked underneath the atmosphere and keep us all warm. However, too much CO2 and Earth starts to feel like a green house in the late stages of spring. Even more CO2 and poof we look like Venus. Humans do contribute to global warming - and that is the major issue right now. The earth has natural recycling methods to rid itself of dangerous levels of CO2 like the rainforests and large areas of trees that use CO2 in photosynthesis. Rising CO2 levels coupled with increased deforestation causes average warmer summers across the globe and and increase in average global temperature. 

People don't understand climatology because science is under-funded in High School and people are scared of things they don't understand. Go out and educate yourselves about science, and the next time a climate change denier tells you global warming is a hoax - ask them to pull out their degree in climatology. When they don't, kindly tell them to go fuck off. This is my fucking home and I won't watch it wither away in the name of corporate profits because of lax environmental regulations and religion.

But in response to lifting the ban on gay service members, Congress began drafting legislation to ensconce the ban into federal law.  Not only that, they put language endorsing an absolute ban on gays in the military into military funding acts such that even Barney Frank had to vote for them or put the funding at risk.

> changing attitudes of servicemembers themselves on the subject   

That would have been super great!  Unfortunately, the military dug its heels in to push back in support of keeping the ban and the Joint Chiefs about lost their minds.  The evangelical right - which had been mostly engaged in anti-abortion activism - coalesced to support the troops in keeping the ban.  

> Wartime militaries aren't pre-occupied with games of smear the queer, they've got wars to win  

Yep.  But, back then the military had a despicable habit of pretending to be oblivious of gay service members if they needed more warm bodies to fight, then immediately discharging them upon their return from a tour in the war zone.  (Assuming they had survived, that is.)

GreenParty,post,privatized,hr9ma1,SwankyGravy,US Senate Candidate Savage Urges Ban on Facial Recognition Technology,"[US Senate Candidate Savage Urges Ban on Facial Recognition Technology](https://www.lisaformaine.org/ban_facial_recognition_technology)  


>Today, independent Green candidate for U.S. Senate Lisa Savage released the following statement:  
>  
>“Facial recognition technology should not be deployed in public, whether by the government or private organizations. In private settings, such as social media sites and in private establishments, everyone should always have the right to object to the use of facial recognition technology, and no person’s face should be stored in a facial recognition database without their express consent.  
>  
>“Researchers have found that facial recognition technology has a gender and racial bias problem. In a large [study conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/12/nist-study-evaluates-effects-race-age-sex-face-recognition-software), Black, Asian, and indigenous people were up to 100 times more likely to be falsely identified as white people. Black women were most likely to be misidentified. That may be a result of two things: 1) the public photos used to train computers to recognize faces include mostly images of white people and 2) engineers at tech companies are, by and large, white men who may be unknowingly designing the facial recognition systems to work best when identifying people that look like them. It’s notable that software developed in Asian countries does not have any problem identifying Asians vs. caucasians.   
>  
>“More worrisome, it recently came to light that Robert Julian-Borchak Williams, a Black man, may have become the first American wrongfully arrested due to a false facial recognition match. Williams was arrested by Michigan police on his front lawn in front of his two young children for a crime he did not commit because the software got it wrong. These are mistakes we cannot risk making, and that’s why there have been calls for facial recognition restrictions at the local, state, and federal levels. ",2020-07-14T20:45:54+00:00,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,privatized,fmdafud,Hij802,,"My main point is that this should be a federal law, although I understand state laws are much easier to pass. Also, I do believe that a good team of lawyers could make an argument to a higher (probably more liberal) court that current drug laws violate the 8th amendment, as they are ""cruel and unusual punishments"", however unlikely this is. A criminal record for drug possession can ruin somebody's life because they lose the right to vote, lose educational opportunities, and lose job opportunities as well. I think sending someone to a hellhole where they can get raped, beat up, stabbed, or even killed for choosing to consume a substance that wouldn't effect anyone but themselves is a very cruel punishment.

 [https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html) 

I think this link is a good representation of the prison population broken down. It is true that drug possession is not the leading cause of prison population, but it does mean about 500,000 of the prison population are there for drug crimes, primarily state and local prisons/jails. Again, nobody should have to have their lives ruined for being a functioning adult who chooses to consume a substance. But you have to think of the bigger picture. Lots of crime is based around drugs. Think about street gangs or cartels. It's pretty safe to say a good chunk of their budget and income is through drug trafficking. With that, comes violence. Most gang violence, such as murders, are usually directed at other gangs. Without drugs, many criminal organizations can fall apart as they lose their main source of income. The War on Drugs just fuels violence. Legalization will not only free many of those in jail for drug crimes currently, but would also reduce the number of future, more violent crimes from occurring, leading to even smaller prison populations further down the line.

As for your last point, yeah the country will probably follow this path with drugs as well. At some point many states will have legalized marijuana, and eventually it will become federal law. Then, I think some other states might loosen their other drug laws, and it will slowly build up like that as well. It's already happening at a local level - 3 cities have already decriminalized plant-based psychedelics. I can imagine that it will probably start with California or Colorado legalizing psychedelics, then slowly the other liberal states will follow suit, and eventually it becomes a federal issue.",2020-04-04T01:17:00+00:00,t1_fmbdill,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Libertarian,comment,hospital,hbxbn84,Lew_Cockwell,,"In an interview with the The Yomiuri Shimbun on August 5, Ozaki spoke in detail about his opinion that ivermectin should be used in Japan and said that his early calls for usage have seemingly not been heeded.  

He stated that there is evidence from multiple countries that ivermectin has proven effective for patients diagnosed with COVID: “I am aware that there are many papers that ivermectin is effective in the prevention and treatment of [coronavirus], mainly in Central and South America and Asia.” 

He also cited a paper examining the preventative effects of ivermectin regarding coronavirus infections in India. According to a study by a group of researchers at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, “Participants who took ivermectin prophylaxis had a lower risk of getting symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection.” 

The Indian study included 3532 health-care workers. According to the study, those “who had taken two-doses of oral ivermectin have a significantly lower risk of contracting COVID-19 disease during the following month.” 

In the abstract, the study states as a summary of the evidence: “Two-doses of oral ivermectin (300 μg/kg given 72 hours apart) as chemoprophylaxis among HCWs reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection by 83% in the following month.” 

Chairman Ozaki stated that despite evidence suggesting the efficacy of ivermectin, it is difficult to obtain the medication. He added that while ivermectin’s established effectiveness is increasingly clear, the U.S. company that manufactures the drug, Merck & Co., Inc., have currently limited distribution because they claim that the drug is ineffective at treating COVID.  

“With the view that it is not effective for the treatment and prevention of sickness, there is an intention that it should not be used for anything other than skin diseases such as psoriasis.”  

This has led to a situation where, according to Ozaki, “Even if a doctor writes a prescription for ivermectin, there is no drug in the pharmacy.” He said that this has rendered the drug practically “unusable.” 

He contends that the fact that supply has been stopped by Merck & Co. is evidence that it does in fact work at treating COVID: “But (Merck) says that ivermectin doesn’t work, so there shouldn’t be any need to limit supply. If it doesn’t work, there’s no demand. I believe it works, so block supply. It looks like you are.”

Even though it's cheaper and more efficient than America's, it's [more expensive](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Total_health_expenditure_per_capita%2C_US_Dollars_PPP.png) and less efficient than the UK's, Germany's and Australia's.

In Australia, we have a hybrid private/public system. Membership in the public system is near-universal (over 99% of the population.) If you are a member, you have absolutely free hospital care available to you. There's no means testing, no conditions; our hospitals will accept anyone free of charge, regardless of how expensive their treatment will be.

If you had cancer and were an Australian, you'd be able to get all the usual, non-experimental treatment at any public hospital in the country.

We also have a thing called ""bulk billing."" Some medical practitioners in the outback or upper-class areas don't allow it, but most health care proffesionals do. The government pays them 85% of the cost of their service, and they don't charge their customer. They normally allow this; more business.

But we still have private health insurance. If they're paying for you, you can usually skip over the usual waiting periods, and go to some flashy, expensive private place.

> The Republican plan to repeal Obamacare and delay the implementation of the repeal - with a promise to come up with a terrific replacement later - is probably its best way to destroy Obamacare.

> Fellow Republican Lamar Alexander says the same thing as Paul: &quot;We have to take each part of it and consider what it would take to create a new and better alternative and then begin to create that alternative and once it&#039;s available to the American people, then we can finally repeal Obamacare.&quot; Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas said on MSNBC, &quot;It would not be the right path for us to repeal Obamacare without laying out a path forward.&quot; And Senator Bob Corker is walking right up to the edge of the same position, asking Trump to tweet out confirmation of what Paul claims he promised.

> Maybe Republicans would call it &quot;Repeal&quot; of Obamacare and &quot;Replacement&quot; with something that&#039;s about 90 percent similar, but that would be symbolic.

You apparently don't know any rich people.  From what I've seen, the rich care more about value than poor people -- that's part of the reason they are rich.

> The entire rest of the world spends less on health care.

Correction: they ration care, either via quantity or quality.   That's not the same as 'spending less'.

> All other developed countries have better population health outcomes. 

Not after you adjust for genetic and lifestyle factors.

> For example, the USA has a high rate of diabetes related amputation.

Which has little to do with the quality of care, and much to do with the fact that we are rich, fat, and lazy.

The LGBT rights movement became successful not just through the sheer force of logic and reason, but because of a change in public perception. Once that perception went from ""gay people are weird perverts"" to ""gay people are normal"" the legalistic changes (gay marriage, gay adoption rights, gay Americans in the military) could follow. Accomplishing this change in attitude was a massive undertaking, with television and movies slowly becoming more accepting of gay characters (e.g. Will & Grace) and trusted public figures coming out as gay (e.g. Ellen DeGeneres), all of which made up the ""face"" of the movement.

Politics,comment,health insurance,fhdempo,Slungus,,"Nevada is next, which has higher Latino turnout and I've heard higher turnout among young people (?). Sanders has nearly completely consolidated the progressive vote. 

Buttigieg and Klobuchar look like they could split the moderate vote in HALF. Biden will almost certainly have an equally bad showing in Nevada as he did tonight. 

Can anyone beat Sanders in NV? Can Biden muster up anything resembling a strong showing? I don't see either happening really. But maybe Pete or Amy can squeak out a win.

Then South Carolina.. Pete and Amy have zero black support. Biden will be in shambles by then. Who wins, if not Sanders?

Then we get to super Tuesday with Bernie winning all 4 (or 3 and half) of the first 4 states. What happens there is harder to predict this far out but man..

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,healthcare,e2jco42,Waylander0719,,">There's going to be a large chunk of funding strictly for the programs administrative fees.

Fair point, though I believe the ammount of funding for administrative overhead is also outlined by congress. You are correct there would be administrative areas where you could possibly find savings.

>reduce the budget by only allowing specific items to be purchased

This is already done. You can't purchase:

Households CANNOT use SNAP benefits to buy:
Beer, wine, liquor, cigarettes or tobacco.
Any nonfood items, such as:
pet foods.
soaps, paper products.
household supplies.
Vitamins and medicines.
Food that will be eaten in the store.
Hot foods

>They will not have an objective to try and reduce the costs of the program due to it's nature

Who do you mean by they?

>These programs will continue to grow as the number of users increase, along with the price of food

The price of SNAP fluctuates depending on employment levels. SNAP spending as a % of GDP (so adjusting for inflation etc) has actually been trending down since around 2011 as the unemployment numbers have dropped.

https://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-the-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap

Also while the people running the SNAP program may not have as much incentive as you would like to maximise efficiency, they are regularly audited by the OIG which make recommendations and helps to ensure efficiency. Here is their most recent report I could find.

https://www.usda.gov/oig/webdocs/27601-0003-22.pdf

It finds that some states spend 2 to 3 times as much as others on administrative costs (because SNAP benefits are block granted to states which then either administer at the state or county level.). I haven't looked into it to much but wonder if these cost differences parallel cost of living in the states with higher costs (for example California is a higher administrative cost but is also one of the highest cost of living states.)",2018-07-17T12:23:08+00:00,t1_e2hyj7j,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
Politics,comment,healthcare,kpogzta,Son_of_Jeff_Cooper,,"Sorry for the delayed response. I just now noticed that you had responded. 

Nice try though, but I actually pulled the numbers from--among others-- [Education Week](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2023/01). Hardly a bastion of pro-gun data reporting. I do, however, appreciate you making yourself look like a blithering fool right off the bat. 

Using the numbers from the Washington Post article you cited, we get an average on 15 school shootings per year. Even accounting for your obviously hyperbolic statement, 15 is a hell of a lot closer to 5 than the 365 we'd get with ""daily"" school shootings as you claim. 

Looking at the very first page of your source further proves my point. Look at the first couple entries on their list of school shootings. 

>Ridgeview Jr. High School in Pickerington, Ohio: A man shot and killed himself inside the school after being confronted by a detective.

>Geary Elementary School in Geary, Okla: A man in a car unintentionally fired a rifle, sending a round into another car on the school’s campus.

>William Penn High School in New Castle, Del: A 16-year-old fired a handgun inside a restroom in the school, leading to a lockdown.

Those are 3 of the first 5 entries on *your own source*, and since your link was paywalled and could only be accessed through an archive link, I couldn't even view the rest of the table. Those entries are incredibly consistent with things I've previously cited as ""school shootings"" here; a man committing suicide in a school that had been closed for months and slated for demolition. A gunfight between gang members where one fleeing assailant merely crossed briefly into an adjacent school's property. A school resource officer who had an accidental discharge of his duty weapon while on school property. 

The school shooting databases you folks love to cite are absolutely **littered** with such events in a blatant and transparent attempt to drive up the numbers and induce fear and rage. When we view the data objectively and consistent with what the general public considers a school shooting (Columbine, Uvalde, Virginia Tech...etc) we find that yes, we average around 5 of those events in any given year. You can try to hide behind your pedantry, but you're not fooling me, the public, your prospective voters and most importantly, yourself. 

Again, honesty and trust are important. How can your prospective voters trust you to solve the problem of school shootings when you can't even be honest about what school shootings are and their severity?",2024-02-09T19:40:08+00:00,t1_kotyj6s,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
