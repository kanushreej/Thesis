PoliticalDiscussion,comment,citizenship,d6z3on2,roland00,,"It has to do with personality and a specific personality trait that has most people assume have negative undertones (in pop culture but it really should not)...this word is called authoritarianism.

To such people with high degrees of this trait, all they see is they broke the rules.  ***You are now untrustworthy***.  Once you broke one rule (entering or staying in this country even though you should not be here), they may the intuitive jump that what is to stop you from breaking other rules such as murder, rape, stealing, fraud, etc.

You have already shown to be untrustworthy since you broke the rule (and are in this country illegally) and now you belong to a category of ""other"" instead of the category of ""trustworthy people / citizens / everybody else""

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

People have personality traits, and these things are crucial to how we view the world, and thus it is hard to understand other people who have different personality traits and they view the world in fundamentally different ways.  **You may never understand the other person's viewpoint (that illegal aliens equal rapists)**  Why some people see illegal immigrants as (closet) rapists, murderers, etc, *may not make sense to you*.  If it does not make sense to you just remember 4 bullet points.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

People who score high on authoritarian traits as a personality.

* Is a worldview that values order

* Is a worldview that values authority

* Is a worldview that distrusts change

* Is a worldview that distrusts perceived outsiders, especially a rapid influx of outsiders

Now having authoritarian traits does not make you a bad person, does not make you vote democrat or republican, all it means is certain things stress you out and without a specific structure to make you feel like the world is not going to go to hell, without these orders your anxiety influences your thoughts.

Vox had a good article a few months ago about authoritarianism

http://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11127424/trump-authoritarianism

One of the things it points out in psychology we know that some people are pretty much ""constantly"" in an authoritarian mindset 24/7 it is just part of their personality.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Immigration,gq6usw0,MisterMysterios,,"There are two distinct questions here: Banning facial coverage during demonstrations and in everyday life.

During demonstrations, it makes sense. The fact that people cover their faces will create the problem that, if the demonstration turns violent, you have considerable problems to prosecute these elements that caused the violence. Also, the first step of getting violent is to cover your face in many instances, meaning that the police can disperse the protests on the merits that faces were started to be covered up, instead of waiting until it turns fully violence. (Disclaimer: I know the US has currently massive issues with police and respecting the right to demonstrate, especially from minorities. This is based on thoughts of systems where these kind of issues are less a problem. I am German, and the banning of face covering during demonstrations is based on this line of thought).

Something different is the question of everyday life. Yes, people in full covering are rather weired in an day to day life, I have seen enough of them, but it is their right to express their religious feelings this way. It is true that there are cases were women are forced into it, but there also many cases where that is not the case and it is their religious feelings that makes them wear it. It is better to go with mandatory education and similar methods to empower the forced women to make an educated choice and, giving the tools, give them the confidence to seek help if they are suppressed like that, than to outright ban a religious symbol.",2021-03-08T07:56:57+00:00,t3_m06h8k,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

* **Should the United States follow in Europe's footsteps and ban all facial coverings in public spaces?**

Not from the US, but from the EU. There are pros and cons of banning them, its quite complicated. 

Pros: Security, not allowing opressive traditions, 

Cons, restriction on religious freedom(when its voluntary), problematic in the age of surveillance

I am torn, but rather yes than no.

* **Are these bans inherently Islamophobic?**

No, Islam does not mandate full facial covering and it applies to everybody.

* **Are identity-concealing facial coverings a real threat to public security that warrant a legal responses?**

Depends on the location but yes. Revealed face and handshakes(as in no weapon in hand) is a sign of openness and trust, while covering your face can evoke feelings of distrust.

* **Should the government regulate what clothings their citizens may wear? Or should each individual have the agency to choose for themselves?**

Specific kind of clothing, especially one that is opressing or dangerous to society( aka ski mask in a bank, hate speech on a T-shirt) should not be allowed.

* **Should governments in the West be legally forcing immigrants to assimilate into Western society and its values?**
* Yes. When you come to a western country, you have to accept western values. You dont have to forfeit your own culture, but have to respect the core values western society is built upon.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Immigration,fm7bkhv,illegalmorality,,"On the travel ban, try thinking about it on a smaller scale, and see if the analogy fits.

Let's pretend I'm about to become a manager of a small company. But before I became manager, I say ""I'm going to fire all white people because white people are racist and they ruin this company.""

Then I become manager, and I do my best to fire most of the white people in the building. However, I'm unable to fire all the white people because there are some hoops I can't jump over (such as Trump's diplomatic obligations) that stops me from banning all white people.

Would I, a person who intentionally tried to direct blame on a certain group of people, be considered a bigot in that case? Even if I didn't accomplish the full extent of what I said I'd do, and I later backtracked on my own words by saying: ""oh, it wasn't because they were white. It was because they were bad workers! This is about work productivity, not racism!""

I'm going to tell you right now. If this were HR (and I've worked in HR), anyone who has said the things Trump has said would've instantly been fired for the things that he's said, regarding Muslims and immigrants alike. Because even if there's plausible deniability in *intent,* the consequences are ultimately the same.

The consequences are groups of people *feeling* like they're being ostracized.

And before you say: ""those people just need to stop assuming like that."" No, you and I don't get to decide how people respond. When there's a gay hate crime, which causes all the gays in the community to move out out of fear for their lives, it doesn't matter if the perpetrator was homophobic or not. The consequences are exactly the same.

Whether Trump *intends* to stroke the fans of racism or not doesn't matter. Hate crime has gone up since 2015, and Trump's rhetoric as president has invigorated the racist community.

Politics,comment,Immigration,l1gyn8b,malrexmontresor,,"That's a common misconception, similar to the lump of labor fallacy.  In reality, migrants are not perfect competition to native workers (that is they don't do the same jobs), but instead **complementary**.  That is, they complement the work done by native workers, adding to their labor, as well as increasing productivity.  They also create more jobs by virtue of being consumers.  It's also not always true that undocumented workers make less in wages.  In agriculture, work is often paid by amount harvested, that is per box filled, not per hour.  Because migrants are more efficient, they actually make more per hour than native workers.

Healthcare,comment,I-130,e3sr1fs,ImpressiveLock,,"I like your ideas! I would like for you to consider a few points (which you may already have!).

I think this would work really well for healthy patients who had no other needs than the routine care and the occasional respiratory infection. But what about when someone needs to see a specialist, or needs a triple bypass? They would still require insurance for those. Which first, makes people pay premium and your membership fees. On top of that, your services that are their out of pocket expenses would not go toward meeting any cost share their regular insurance requires. 

You briefly mention employer-paid insurance and wrap-around insurance, but if more than one person needed to be airlifted at any time, you'd be in the hole over $300k for each patient. Is that sustainable for your practice?

And what about health care reform? Insurances are required to offer Essential Health Benefits and cover certain amounts of the costs, in order to be a Qualified Health Plan. Individuals must pay a penalty on their taxes if they don't have a QHP. Would your plan be able to get that status? 

Sadly, I think you would run into people who abuse your system and over-use your office visits and seemingly unlimited available benefits, & for lack of a better word, gunk up the system?

I know my points are kind of negative, but I do think you have great ideas, and I love that you're trying to help your patients. You are very obviously a caring physician and I hope your patients appreciate you!",2018-08-08T01:08:09+00:00,t3_94o9cn,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

I'm a Swedish-American (dual citizenship) born and raised in Sweden (long story...). Anyway, I decided to move to America and I got to say I am chocked. Here I was, thinking that I would pay something like 20% of my income in taxes, which is fine I wouldn't mind that if I get some basic service. I ended up in California and oh my lord is the taxes high. Keep in mind that I come from northern Europe, Sweden. The idea of the nordic model is that you pay a lot in taxes but you get a lot for it as well. Even though I love America and the life here, I just can't get around the fact that I will end up paying shitloads of taxes here while I get nothing for it. How come people accept that? Why don't people riot about that shit? I'm pretty sure that I, here in CA, will end up paying around 30-40% in taxes and I'm scared. I don't have any kids, I don't have a mortgage, what is there to deduct??? Do I vote republican to change this situation? Oh and being from a welfare semi-socialist country, I got to say that USA got a lot of similarities. Is the ""spend the money I earned on what I want""-mentality just a fantasy dream?

Politics,comment,Immigration,kjteun1,Okbuddyliberals,,"America needs to embrace the market, for immigration and other things too. But we won't do that - the unholy right left populist agenda won't allow it

If we massively increased legal high and low skill immigration (letting people work as soon as they got here), deregulated zoning and allowed corporations/developers to substantially increase supply of housing, slashed regulations that play a big role in obstructing new green energy, slashed occupational licensing requirements, and embraced free trade rather than tariffs, the economy would be so much stronger, with most folks benefiting, and with the ability to tax more without disrupting the economy as much in order to pay for more programs to help people in need, too

But instead we'd rather restrict. Restrict immigration because ""it's good for existing workers"" (it isn't). Restrict housing because ""it's good for existing homeowners"" (it makes their property values go up, but what's the point of selling your house for more if you also have to pay more to buy a new house?). Restrict trade because it's best for our own workers and foreign workers (wrong on both accounts). Restrict new energy construction because of nonsense like ""windmills kill birds"" (burning earth with climate change will kill many more birds). And so on. 

Capitalism and markets have been our strength, but now we are deciding to oppose them in all the areas where embracing them could help more.

Incentives should be put into place to raise the TFR to around 2.0-2.2. If needed, people should be aggressively taxed if they opt out to have children. 

In the meantime, while that generation grows, you have a 18-20 years waiting period where you would need to hire seasonal workers on temp visas. Poland does this with Ukrainians, Belarussians etc, employ for a few months and send them back. Also, keep up a permanent but restricted immigration policy for brain drain purposes.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Immigration,j70u12i,Gorrium,,"Wouldn't be a problem if housing was affordable but even so it won't cause societal collapse. Humans while tribal are also socially adaptive. We are able to allow outsiders into the tribe and expand the tribe. Tribes don't have to be isolative and ones that are, always fall apart eventually. Europe can't support its economies if they don't maintain population and they can't do that without an influx flow of citizens. Now while you could try to increase the ""native"" birth rate, forced human breeding is largely frowned upon. 

So we have two options

let in immigrants and gain some new course meals and risk random flares of violent acts from time to time from far right white nationalists.

Or

Let a continent slowly die and shrink, causing a complete socioeconomic collapse of an entire continent that controls a third of the world's financing.

Also immigrants tend to be very trusting and kind people.
