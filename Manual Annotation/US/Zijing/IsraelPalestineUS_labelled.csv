Democrats,post,Gaza,1bd3uqh,John3262005,Democrats launch effort to force vote on Ukraine,"House Democrats on Tuesday formally launched their promised effort to force a vote on Ukraine aid, a long-shot bid to compel the legislation to the floor over the objection of the Republican leaders who control the chamber. 

Sponsored by Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), ranking member of the House Rules Committee, the Democrats’ discharge petition would require 218 signatures to force consideration of a Senate-passed foreign aid package, which provides $95 billion for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and humanitarian assistance in Gaza. 

The Senate had passed the bill last month by a vote of 70-29, with 22 Republicans — including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) — supporting the legislation. 

But the proposal has hit a brick wall in the lower chamber, where Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has refused to consider it, citing the absence of language to strengthen security on the U.S.-Mexico border.

To break the logjam, McGovern and Democratic leaders are hoping to find enough bipartisan support for the discharge petition to sidestep Johnson’s opposition and bring the Senate bill to the floor, where they predict it would pass easily with more than 300 votes.

Some liberal Democrats are already balking at the idea of providing more military aid to Israel — as the Senate bill does — amid a war with Hamas that’s already killed more than 30,000 people in Gaza. Those lawmakers want conditions put on that aid, ensuring Israel complies with international human rights guidelines. 

Across the aisle, meanwhile, even moderate Republicans — those deemed most likely to endorse McGovern’s discharge petition — are hammering the Democrats’ strategy of insisting on the Senate’s version of the foreign aid package. Those voices say no Ukraine aid can pass through the House without tougher border security. 

Hoping to bridge that divide is Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), who has introduced his own discharge petition designed to force a vote on a broader Ukraine package that includes the border security provisions many Republicans are demanding. 

That proposal has already won the support of a handful of moderate Democrats, who are warning that their approach is the only viable way to get more Ukraine aid to President Biden’s desk this year. 

Yet Democratic leaders are warning that Ukraine — which is under siege from Russian forces and running low on ammunition —  simply doesn’t have the time to wait for Congress to bounce competing bills back and forth between the two chambers.

Pro Palestinian people tend to be young and see the border wall but didn’t live through the images of blown up busses, weddings bombed, pizza shops bombed, etc. That relentless campaign of suicide bombings was what predicated a border wall - it wasn’t just like the Israelis one day decided to imprison Gaza as the pro-Palestinian would have you believe. They also do not really conceive of the millennia of persecution that Jews have experienced not just in Europe but in Arab countries as well, nor do they understand the commitment to destroying Israel that is shared among contemporary Muslim countries. 

I’m pro-Israel simply because there are many, many countries that get to exist unbothered on stolen land. It does seem that there is a bias that makes people focus on this conflict more than any other, and that feels very much like a hatred of Jews. I support israel because there is one tiny Jewish nation among 50 Muslim ones, 15 Christian, and 7 Buddhist. You KNOW that many of those nations have committed atrocities to defend or establish themselves. 

It is painful to live through and witness the birth of a state, but it is unusual how long Israel has had to fight to simply assert its own right to exist. Despite this, they’ve warmed relations with other Arab states. They’ve created innovative technology and birthed a vibrant culture by hybridizing many cultures of the Jewish refugees that ended up there. 

Furthermore, there are many groups of people that have been displaced and abused throughout history. They do not all resort to terrorism and many give up on their right to return like my family, who was not offered any right to return when they were displaced, they moved on in search of a better life. I find that the focus on Palestinian displacement is so disproportional to other global conflicts and it makes me very suspicious of why that is.",2023-10-26T01:10:44+00:00,t3_17gaj00,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

There was a massive firing of people at the RNC and a pledge requirement that you had to agree that the 2020 election was stolen to be employed. And an RNC lawyer that was hired by Trump aides was pushed out because he didn’t believe the 2020 election was stolen and that pissed off Trump. The aides tried to do damage control and give him a graceful exit by saying he had a time conflict.

Geopolitics,comment,Hamas,l6fns2e,EveryConnection,,"This feels a bit like a conspiracy theory where the guilty parties are identified beforehand, Netanyahu and radical Israelis who want to seize all the land of Gaza, and the reasons for the guilt are found afterwards, namely that Hamas somehow could have been destroyed with some sort of decapitation strike but this wasn't done.

What other factors do we need to make this true? Let's consider.

1. Israel's intelligence in relation to Hamas is so good that it has the ability to just do a decapitation strike and destroy Hamas' leadership with a minimal cost to Israel's international reputation and own troops, but Israel's intelligence about Hamas also was not good enough for it to know that October 7 would happen.

2. Despite Israel having that capability, the United States needs to either not know that it can do that (which is hard when the US has the largest intelligence community in the world), or be complicit with Netanyahu and the radical Israelis, even though this war has also hurt the US' international standing.

3. Hamas perpetrated October 7 while being ignorant of the fact that Israel could easily destroy them at a minimal cost to Israel, and only chose to make the war costly for itself for political reasons. I don't think the Hamas leadership could have predicted that Israel would make such a strange decision.

All in all, I think it's pretty clear where Occam's Razor would lie... that Israel is waging war, because that was the best decision it had at the time in response to October 7.",2024-05-31T05:04:49+00:00,t1_l6fm2gs,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I have some trouble imagining he would gain more support than he'd lose.

Geopolitics,comment,Palestinian,k4lhtkl,bxbb,,"Muslim here. Few things to consider:

- There's no continuous leadership and/ or organization that fight for Uyghurs national identity. Last successful attempt was pre-civil war era (2nd East Turkmenstan).
- TIP claimed leadership of separatist, but since they operate as cross-border group that goes as far as Syria, its hard to justify their claim. Compare it to Hamas and Taliban which focus their effort in their respective area of influence (Gaza and Afghanistan).
- Up until dissolution of USSR, Xinjiang separatism was backed by the Soviet. This goes against prevalent narrative of pan-islamist fight against communist influence (esp Afghanistan and Pakistan), further increasing the narrative disconnect.
- After CCP power consolidation, conditions in the region was relatively stable. Only deteriorating quickly after Ghulja Massacre (1997). Before 1997, CCP propaganda was focused on national unity and most trouble in the region was attributed to ""Uyghurs in exile"" and pan-islamist movement. Post-1997, the separatist MO shifted to terror attack such as bus bombing and suicide bombing. This coincides with rise of islamic extremism across the world, whose victim includes Muslim countries (JI, MILF, Boko Haram, Al Qaeda).
- Further escalation was seen up to its peak in 2014, and has been in decline since, after CCP's harsh response.
- Western media mostly focused in the narrative of Hamas as a terrorist group. However, they also capable of administering the region, going as far as [teaching Hebrew](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-university-now-offers-a-degree-in-hebrew/) in their university and [building amusement parks](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2013/06/al-nour-resort-gaza.html) for child of war victims. This gave them credibility as administrator of a state, which in turn make supporting the state of Palestine easier to defend.


To put it simply, we can support Palestine due to the existing national identity in place and possibility of alternate outcome if peace is attained. The same, sadly, cannot be said for Uyghurs. The core issue in Xinjiang is not about religion, its about governance. Bar the collapse of either PRC or TIP, there's no alternate outcome in which Uyghur's condition improve.

Conservatives,post,Gaza,17t1jub,Head_Estate_3944,"Hamas Palestinian Official: If We Could Turn Back Time, We'd Do Oct. 7 All Over Again","Osama Hamdan said the assault on Israel was 'aimed at ending Israel's attempts to bring an end to the Palestinian cause'

Amid debate in some corners of the internet over whether Hamas terrorists targeted civilians during their massacre in Israel, or whether it was a legitimate military action, the leaders of Hamas are continuing to make it very clear: the Oct. 7 operation was a smashing success, in their eyes, and one they'd do all over again if given the opportunity.

A senior Hamas official said as much in a recent interview, responding to a hypothetical question by saying that if he could go back a month in time, the Islamic Palestinian terrorist group would opt to carry out their Oct. 7 massacre in southern Israel that left 1,400 people dead all over again.

""The answer is yes,"" Osama Hamdan said when asked about the hypothetical scenario in an interview published Tuesday by Al-Liwaa, a daily newspaper in Lebanon.

""The operation was not a momentary step, but rather part of [Hamas's] strategy which is aimed at ending Israel's attempts to bring an end to the Palestinian cause and to build local alliances that will remove the Palestinian people from history,"" he added, according to a translation by nonprofit Middle East Media Research Institute.

Hamdan said the ""greatest achievement"" of the attack was not just the damage done to the Israeli military and its ""true image,"" but also ""the fact that the operation ended Israel's ambitions to become a natural entity in the region at the expense of the Palestinian nation.""

The gruesome surprise assault last month that plunged Israel into war with Hamas in Gaza included a rampage through Israeli communities and at a music festival, where gunmen killed at least 260 people.

Videos captured by body cameras worn by Hamas Palestinian gunmen — as well as dashboard, security and surveillance cameras — shown by Israeli officials to international journalists and world leaders in recent weeks show Hamas Palestinian fighters murdering Israelis in front of their families.

Reporters described seeing images of burned Israeli  babies and children, along with other indescribably graphic scenes.

In testimony released this week, a Jewish survivor recalled witnessing how the Palestinian terror gunmen raped a young woman and shot her in the head as they did.

The Palestinian militants then cut the Jewish woman's breast off her body and ""literally played with it on the road,"" the witness said.

More than 200 other people were taken hostage during the siege and are believed to be in Hamas custody in the vast tunnel network that runs underneath the Gaza Strip.

In this week's interview, Hamdan said most of the hostages are Israeli soldiers who ""will be swapped in a prisoner exchange after [Israel's] aggression is over.""

He said other captives were taken into Gaza ""by various means"" – not by Hamas, but rather, other terrorist forces.

""Some of them have dual citizenship and some of them are foreigners. We have counted over 51 dual citizens,"" Hamdan said.

""Under the current circumstances we cannot count all of them, since they are not in Hamas's possession… They are not in our possession and are located throughout the Gaza Strip. Some of them are held by other forces, and some by other elements.""

So far Hamas Palastinian militants released only a handful of the hostages: two elderly Israeli women and an American teenager and her mother from Evanston, Illinois, Natalie Raanan and Judith Tai Raanan.

The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza has reported more than 10,500 deaths since the start of the war last month.",2023-11-11T19:18:24+00:00,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

It’s hard to do that when the strip is run by Hamas, and if Hamas is destroyed some other militant group will fill the gap and any aid organization will have to deal with them if they want to get anything done.


>aid reaches the people that needed it and not get taken by Hamas.

Hamas is also virtually the only group in the the strip that can reliably protect aid convoys even if they also stole from them as well. Unless you’re willing to send in an armed force with UNHCR it’ll be hard to prevent aid from getting stolen by criminals in the Gaza Strip as it is currently.

>Sudan, Ukraine, Syria. All had similar orders of magnitude of refugees

Neither of these refugee groups political situations were remotely similar. Sudanese refugees either stayed in Sudan or went to neighboring countries such as Egypt. Ukrainian refugees either moved to the western part of the country or to neighboring European countries. Syrians either stayed in Syria or moved to neighboring countries like Turkey. 

Of the countries bordering Palestine, one is in an active war with it, one is in the middle of a civil war, one cannot give Palestinian refugees citizenship without a crisis and one cannot resettle Palestinians in the Sinai without a massive crisis.

Good tactic on paper but in real life Israel is over the rocket firing and terror attacks.,2024-05-13T05:53:35+00:00,t1_l3tangb,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Politics,comment,Netanyahu,kpr2bmj,applejackhero,,"I mean, obviously many politicians genuinely just really support Israel regardless, Joe Biden included. I don’t think anyone is trying to content that. The issue is how much money a lobbying group for a foreign government just funnels into the Us political system. Especially Israel is increasingly undemocratic, and intent on instigating conflict in the Middle East. We KNOW politicians are incredibly swayed by lobbyists. Imagine if Russia was openly lobbying our politicians this much.",2024-02-10T06:36:50+00:00,t1_kpr21ol,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

He has done some bad shit. But I have to praise him on the way he handled the violent Islamic insurgency in his country. The Moro Coflict has resulted in twice as many deaths as the I/P conflict and is widely underreported. He definitely has back tracked on the China ties. 

Filipinos love him. 

Also, try to find other sources than al Jazeera.",2021-09-25T22:54:47+00:00,t3_pvd29i,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
Neoliberal,comment,Hamas,gybwtou,Acebulf,,So you're claiming that the Associated Press maybe has an incentive to lie? How does that validate the Israeli claim? Doesn't Israel have a far greater incentive to lie on this issue? (i.e. geopolitical implications),2021-05-16T15:02:29+00:00,t1_gybumgx,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
