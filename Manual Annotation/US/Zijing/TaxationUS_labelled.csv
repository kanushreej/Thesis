'Taxation of theft' is just a statement that 'I am forced to pay taxes.'

Okay, and?

Therefore what?

There is no sense in arguing 'taxation is theft' in a vaccuum, it is absurd.  Instead ask the 'so what' and have them explain why we should therefore eliminate liberalism and all other forms of 'non consensual contracts' and their solution where they somehow pay for every foot of road they drive on via an app or something.

You don't address the argument on a standalone basis but in its greater context.

I am forced to live in a world where there are other people, I did not consent to it.  I posit that this is unfair to me. Who are you to say that it isn't unfair when I feel it is unfair as I did not consent to this.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,deductible,c53np5m,mrhymer,,"You have three problems. 

1. One is a middle man problem and a lawyer problem. Doctors take an oath to treat the sick but access to doctors is blocked by corporations that are in business to make a profit. The solution to your problem is a better kind of doctor. A doctor 2.0 that will banish the middle man and deal with you directly. I outline how doctor 2.0 would work at the end of this post.

2. You have a lawyer problem. Doctors are hesitant to provide risky care because lawyers are waiting in the shadows looking for any bogus reason to sue. What you need to protect you is tort reform that finally creates a loser pays system in the US. You also need capped damages for malpractice claims. The key to winning this victory is a again doctor 2.0. Doctors by oath should not turn away a patient but doctor 2.0 will charge every lawyer and elected official the same amount as his malpractice insurance premiums until the tort reform is passed. More about doctor 2.0 at the end

3. Your medications are so expensive largely because of the FDA and the patent structure. These are government problems and not medical problems. The FDA should be abolished and replaced by private organizations who compete. This will lower the cost of approval and the time to market which will lower the cost of drugs. Voters and the servants they elect will have to make this change.

Medical patents should be restructured to allow competitors to buy in to the process from the start. If pfizer discovers viagra then any competitor may pay pfizer a buy in fee that is based on cost of development and a share of the profits generated. This is again a voter change.



Doctor 2.0
 
We need to pay doctors and hospitals first instead of last. Private citizens pay private insurance companies 2.5 trillion dollars a year for access to doctors and hospitals. Instead of paying doctors and hospitals by visit and by procedure pay them the money that goes to insurance companies each month in exchange for a commitment from doctors and hospitals to take care of all of our healthcare needs.
 
Here is how it would work. You pay your primary doctor each month who then contracts with a range of specialists and a hospital or two in your area. Your market choice becomes any primary care practice in your area. Your doctor is a part of a national reciprocation network that covers you when you travel and part of the money you pay your doctor goes into a national catastrophic fund for those rare illnesses that require travel and extended care. Prices would come down through competition. The hundreds of millions taken out in insurance company operations and profit could go to lower the price. Hospitals would be fully funded without having to admit a single patient so charging $80 for a box of tissues would end. Doctors would earn more money than investment bankers so the Doctors shortage would be over in a few years. The primary care doctor would be the center of the medical universe and he is already paid before you get sick so no unnecessary procedures or follow up visits. There would many alternatives like webcam diagnosis and phone call follow-ups that would be great for patients. How much illness is spread because Doctors cannot be paid unless sick people all gather and wait in the same room?
 
If we combine this change with strong malpractice tort reform then doctors will be able to reach out and be much more charitable. They will already be paid well so if we can limit the risk of giving care then doctors who are inclined to do so can give reduced rates or even free care for those who cannot afford their regular rates. In the US, the crux of the problem is charging by the visit or by the procedure. It is the wrong incentive. Doctors are paid more when the patient is sick. If you pay the doctor when you are healthy like you do the health insurance companies then the financial incentive to the doctor is to have you healthy and at home and not visiting or having a procedure.
 
A single person pays an average of $6,000 dollars a year for health care coverage. If that person is healthy he will see the doctor an average of three visits per year. Assume the average visit pays the doctor's practice $300. That is $900 dollars out of $6000 that goes to the doctor. Now suppose the entire $6,000 goes to the doctor. He uses half of that money to contract with a range of specialists practices and a hospital so that all of your local health needs are met. He also uses a bit of that half to add you to a reciprocation network so that you are fully covered when you travel. He also contributes a bit into a national catastrophic care fund that handles rare expensive cases that involve traveling to a specialist and experimental treatments etc. The doctor's practice now has $3000 guaranteed dollars from you instead of a speculative $900. That is more than three times what the doctor could eek out charging by visit. Everything but consumables is paid for. All salaries, the building, all the testing equipment is all paid in full before you arrive. The doctor is competing with the dozens of other practices in your community. The specialists and the hospitals are competing to be in the doctors networks. There is a lot of room for lower prices in this model. There is no compulsion to go back to the petrie dish waiting room for a follow up. much more cost effective for the doctor to call or skype. Internet medicine would no longer be stifled by insurance company or government rules. The internist or GP doctor would be the center of the medical universe as it should be.

Notice that this solution does not mention government. This plan would only require a consensus of courageous doctors to implement. The national average payout for medicare is more than $6000 a year. Government could pay the primary doctor on your behalf but the relationship and decisions would be between you and the doctor only.

I forget where I saw it, but I remember an in depth comment somewhere on Reddit about how the aim of (edit: the) US military is to be able to fight on two major fronts at once (like what was done in WW2 in Europe and the Pacific). The goal used to be to be able to simultaneously win on both fronts, but during the 90's with the Cold War over it was changed to being able to win on one front and hold back the enemy on the second one until fighting was done on the first front

Campaign finance is obvious. To address the other issues (healthcare, college affordability, moving to a renewable energy source, etc), we need representatives who work for the people. The current representatives largely work for rich billionaires, meaning that they're less incentivized to address the issues that matter to the constituency. If we don't address the issue of campaign finance, even our net neutrality could be at risk.

Media coverage is a product of the failing campaign finance system. The corporations that bribe political candidates also own media networks. Wonder why CNN is covering Hillary R. Clinton so much? Of course, Time Warner owns CNN and funds Hillary Clinton. This is the crux of why I believe that Jill E. Stein is a better candidate than Gary E. Johnson. The rich capitalist industrialists are more willing to broadcast Johnson, who protects their interests, than Stein, who protects your interests.

Conservatives,post,taxed,12xt5ja,SmrtConsumer9111,Penalize Responsible Buyers who have good credit??? WTH," As a conservative, I believe in limited government and personal responsibility. That's why I find President Biden's new mortgage policy troubling, which requires those with good credit to pay an additional $40 per month. While the policy's goal is to help struggling homeowners, it's not the government's place to force responsible borrowers to subsidize those who aren't.

First of all, let's be clear about what this policy means. The Biden administration is proposing to create a $10 billion Homeowner Assistance Fund to help struggling homeowners catch up on missed mortgage payments, taxes, and insurance. To fund the program, the administration wants to impose a new fee on borrowers with good credit. The fee is expected to raise about $500 million per year, which will be used to support the program.

On the surface, this policy may seem like a good idea. After all, many homeowners have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and this program aims to help them avoid foreclosure. However, I believe that the policy is fundamentally flawed and goes against conservative principles.

First and foremost, the government has no business forcing responsible borrowers to pay for the mistakes of others. If someone can afford to pay their mortgage and has good credit, they should not be penalized for the failures of those who don't. It's not fair to ask people who have done the right thing to pay for the mistakes of others.

Secondly, this policy sets a dangerous precedent. If the government can force people to pay an additional fee for their good behavior, what's next? Will they start taxing people who exercise regularly or eat healthy? Will they penalize those who save money or invest wisely? This policy opens the door to all sorts of intrusive government interventions that erode personal freedom and individual responsibility.

Finally, this policy ignores the root cause of the problem. The reason why so many homeowners are struggling to pay their mortgages is that the government shut down the economy in response to the pandemic. Instead of creating new fees and taxes, the government should focus on getting the economy back on track so that people can get back to work and pay their bills.

In conclusion, while the Biden administration's new mortgage policy may sound well-intentioned, it's a misguided approach that goes against conservative principles. Rather than penalizing responsible borrowers for the mistakes of others, the government should focus on creating policies that promote economic growth and personal responsibility. Only then can we truly help those in need and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to achieve the American Dream.

For those of us that are lower-level middle class, but have kept our credit in good standing, we are the ones getting hit. Lets start raising our voice NOW!",2023-04-24T19:18:41+00:00,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
PoliticalDiscussion,post,taxation,xme1z,emperorko,"Liberal Redditors - do you actually support ""social engineering"" or ""vice"" taxes?","Apologies in advance if this rambles a bit.  I'm very strongly conservative when it comes to politics, and far more often than not, I'm adamantly opposed to most forms of taxation.  I do make it a point to discuss opposing viewpoints with people who disagree, but I've always had a very hard time understanding the other side of the aisle when it comes to taxation designed to discourage particular conduct.

For example, over the past few decades, cigarette taxes have risen exponentially in an effort to discourage smoking.  Recently, NYC implemented a plan to increase taxes on soda because people are too damn fat.  Flash back further into the past, and the National Firearms Act implemented a registration tax that - at the time - was very high and punitive to discourage people from buying particular weapons.  Gas taxes frequently increase, partly in an effort to discourage overuse of resources.  Alcohol taxes increase.  Jurisdictions that allow gambling sometimes have higher taxes on gambling winnings than other income.  Etc. Etc. ad nauseam.  

Do liberals *actually* support these initiatives, or is this just something that politicians do without respecting the wishes of their constituencies?  If you do support this type of governance, what happens if/when the tide turns against your opinion?  I hate to employ the slippery slope argument, but this seems to be a prime example of a situation in which it would apply.  

What's the actual limit to the government's power to engineer your behavior?  What happens if someday the government decides that something *you* enjoy is a Bad Thing (TM)?

It's also really hard to make the case (at least to that 87% of households below 175k) that, in order to give *some* of these 13% households a small break in their taxes, we have to also give many times more to those at the top 5% or top 1%.

- Volvo is actually Swedish and is two separate companies - 1 is the car company (the one that you are referencing that went bankrupt and purchased by some Chinese automotive firm) the other is the manufacturer of heavy equipment (trucks, buses, etc) and is still ticking along just fine.

Vattenfall is the Swedish energy company but has operations in other parts of Europe, so not really global.

Statoil is most definitely among the top 20 in oil companies. If you take out the 100% state-owned companies (Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, etc), they would be top 10 and are among the top tier of oil and gas. While they got their start in the North Sea, they now operate around the globe. In terms of respect, they are definitely among the best.

The only economy that benefits from the oil and gas in the North Sea is Norway. Specifically the state-run pension (which owns 1% of global securities - not bad for a country of 5mm) and the Norwegian people are the largest benefactors, rather than Statoil.

They are forced to provide only the best care they can reasonably offer within a constrained timeframe to maximize profits. Unfortunately very few physician owned practices now exist. Most of the few that were still remaining have been bought up by the larger hospitals in town to minimize competition. most towns now have only one or two dominate hospitals to choose from as smaller offices and hospitals have conjoined.

If you look back at the pre-Reagan years, we had a low debt and high (70% marginal rates) taxes. Fast forward 40 years of yearly deficits (barring a brief 4 years in the 90s) and we have a higher debt and lower taxes.

How is this possible? Why haven't the deficits from the 80s, 90s, 00s, and 10s come due yet?

To put it simply, government and household debts are very different. A household may have a one mortgage that it pays back on a very specific schedule at one rate, but a government has the equivalent of a million different mortgages issued at different times, with different maturities and different rates. The debt is always being rolled over and being re-financed.

What's been happening over the past 40 years is that our willingness to issue more public debt has been surpassed by the market's demand for it. 

This is because US government bonds play a critical role in the functioning of trading and financial systems in the US and around the world.

Adjusting Dividend income taxes would increase taxes ~$4 Million on the Highest Earners 

A 2021 Tax Policy Center study found that the amount of purchases subject to the sales tax, including general sales taxes and excise taxes like the motor fuel tax, was an average of 39 percent of purchases.

* That revenue from general sales taxes was $411 billion
 * On those purchases that are taxed, State general sales tax rates in 2020 range from 2.9 percent in Colorado to 7.25 percent in California. After Colorado, the next-lowest state general sales tax rate is 4.0 percent in Alabama

The lowest standard rate of VAT throughout the EU is 16%


* In Norway The standard VAT rate is 25% A VAT rate of 15% is levied on the sale of food.

In the Netherlands, the standard VAT rate is 21%.

**Yet American Think Tank Says**

>State policymakers looking to make their tax codes more equitable should consider eliminating the sales taxes families pay on groceries if they haven’t already done so

Thirteen of the 45 states with a sales tax still impose it on groceries. 

-----
So to be more like other countries Tax 97% of purchases at 15% sales tax

So First 411 x 2.5 to include almost all purchases are now charged sales taxes


* $1.03 Trillion in Sales Taxes

Now with the sales tax rate at about 6% on those purchases, 2.5 times that Sales tax revenue to have a better tax rate at 15%

* $2.55 Trillion in Sales Tax revenue

Subtract out the refunds for Previous Sales tax and Property Taxes

* $1.6 Trillion in Funding gives the US Healthcare


No one will agree to a VAT, and higher Gas Taxes
