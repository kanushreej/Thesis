Climatechange,comment,climate change,kvqdv2x,nobodyspecial9412,,"We developed technology and industry that caused the current swing in climate (an ongoing heating of the planet at a rate faster than anything ever seen elsewhere in the geologic record). It stands to reason that our adaptation, mitigation, and ultimate long-term solution to the problem would be the development of technologies that allow us to maintain a stable climate indefinitely.

That’s an oversimplified answer, as technology alone won’t save us if we don’t seriously reevaluate our lifestyles and relationships with nature, and in any case such technological solutions are still far from sufficient viability to be of real use, but as a direct answer to your question, “Why do we think we can halt climate change?” the answer is, “because we know we can.” In the short term and near-long term that ability is limited to reducing carbon emissions so that the warming plateaus sooner rather than later. A more ambitious project, which will require new/better technologies (in addition to things like effective reforestation), would be removing CO2 from the atmosphere in a way that brings us back to pre-industrial levels. Finally, an even longer-term, more hypothetical, but just as possible project would be using our technology and knowledge to regulate GHG levels such that we calibrate the climate to remain more or less stable in the long term.

All much easier said than done, but it’s a far better thought than just “Hurdy dur we can’t do anything because the cycle.”",2024-03-20T13:55:21+00:00,t3_1bjdmsz

- Appointing judges is just signing a piece of paper (which we saw in Louisiana, he loves doing for no reason); doesn't require him to actually do anything

- Passing tax cuts for the wealthy was done by a Republican Congress, not Trump

- ""Shutting down travel"" for COVID was done AFTER the airlines shut down travel

- Every one of his bans on people failed because the people he surrounds himself with are stupid too

What else is there? His businesses all failed because of poor leadership. Which is EXACTLY what he brought to this country. He seriously thinks his role is to be a ""cheerleader"" because his entire life, his role has been to be an empty suit.

Mike-Not being a financial adviser, but what I have noticed was an initial euphoria and then rapid expansion (bubble) with legalization in Canada. As you have noticed, the revenue projections have not kept up with demand. Long term, cannabis is a great investment. Short term….Investors need to realize this is a volatile issue with a lot of complex factors to consider in a difficult regulatory and legal environment. But much of the stock retrenchment is happening now, and it’s a great opportunity for investors to get involved early, as well as to get behind smaller businesses that might be overlooked by other investors.

I have had training in  and have worked with Statistical Process Control. SPC is used in manufacturing by regularly measuring the product that comes off the lines. The product must fit within certain guidelines. It's like driving when your car starts weaving from side to side at odd times. You know something is wrong and there are things that tell you if the problem is getting worse or better. Car computers run a form of this in their diagnoses.  In machining with a lathe anything between just stopping to blowing apart can happen. SPC is relied on as an accurate predictor in almost all production. It can be used to analyze other things.  Like weather. Something's gonna break or stop, bigtime.

Trump called Hillary a ""criminal"" and openly encouraged ""lock her up"" chants at his rallies. He has accused Obama,  Bill Clinton, and others of criminal acts numerous times in the past.

Trump is under DOJ investigation for breaking 3 federal laws: 18 USC 2071—Concealment, removal or mutilation of information, 18 USC 793—Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information, and 18 USC 1519—Destruction, alteration or falsification of records in Federal investigations. Those are the crimes outlined in the search warrant, there may be more.  By Trump's own admission of holding declassifying the items at Mar a Lago, he broke the law. Any records that would have been classified belong in the national archives. There is no ambiguity there, he absolutely broke the law.

The Mueller report outlined 10 instances of potential obstruction of justice by Trump, but he was not charged because of the Justice Department’s opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted, not because the evidence did not warrant it. [In fact the conduct outlined in the Mueller report would have lead to multiple felony charges against anyone else, according to over 1000 former federal prosecutors who signed a letter stating as such.](https://medium.com/@dojalumni/statement-by-former-federal-prosecutors-8ab7691c2aa1)

Politics,comment,climate change,ikevaxy,MadHatter514,,"> Carter put solar panels on the White House. Reagan had them removed immediately to send a message.



Actually, it really wasn't as malevolent as you are making it sound. They were removed during renovations to the roof of the White House years into his presidency (which were planned prior to Reagan's term, and required the panels to be removed in order to do the repairs). 
It wasn't right away in some act of disgust or opposition to the idea of solar panels. The main reason they were not reinstalled after the renovations is that they weren't cost effective at all. 

The Carter Administration panels were not photovoltaic solar panels that produced electricity; they were solar water heater panels. They didn't come close to meeting the requirements of the White House West Wing; they were expensive and had no way of storing the hot water, so it would cool after leaving the panels. Solar water heaters have a place, but it isn't in dish washing and laundry (which was primarily the use case in that part of the West Wing). They work splendidly for things like the White House swimming pool (and the Bush Administration installed them for the pool later).

Carter was very big on alternative energy and energy conservation; it wasn't so much that Reagan was against it, he just wasn't a big promoter of it. Those folks that decide what maintenance is done in the White House decided not to re-install the hot water system. They had originally been put up as a public relations promotion more than anything else.",2022-08-15T18:11:46+00:00,t1_ikdy5ic

Climatechange,post,anthropogenic,16ulxrt,stisa79,The waste heat effect,"This is perhaps controversial but I hope you hear me out. It is a genuine question. I believe in anthropogenic global warming, just to get that out of the way. The question is how we can know that this is primarily due to CO2 release and not waste heat? The effect each of these would have on global warming is quite complex, and I am not sure if anybody has been able to quantify the waste heat effect on the global temperature. So how can we know that this is almost negligible compared to the greenhouse effect, because that seems to be the assumption?

Since waste heat and CO2 are correlated, they also both correlate strongly with the global temperature. So it is not easy to separate the two merely by considering empirical data. But I have thought about a couple of things that speak in favor of the waste heat effect being more dominant compared to CO2 than we perhaps tend to think.

* The warming asymmetry that has been identified suggests that night temperatures and annual minimum temperatures increase more than day and annual maximum, respectively. I think this is better explained by increased heating than CO2.
* Global temperatures during WWII were significantly higher than the years before and after. It seems more than a coincidence. We know that was a time with a lot of combustion by ramped up production and military activity. Releasing CO2 in the atmosphere too of course, but that would not explain the cooling after WWII, so again waste heat seems a better explanation. 

I realize that I may be making some wrong assumptions along the way, and that there might be other evidence that is better explained by CO2 than waste heat. So if you know anything about this, please enlighten me.",2023-09-28T17:22:48+00:00,

I'm sorry you couldn't understand it. Clearly over your head. 

False accusations still need to have evidence provided.

>According to NASA, Earth is greening.

So,  NASA is untrustworthy, except when you think it supports your incorrect opinion. 

>This is good news. There is nothing inherently bad about small increases in average global temperature.

Wrong, but thanks for establishing you were too scared to read any of the peer-reviewed sourced evidence I provided.

>The whole theory is based on a whole stack of assumptions.

No. I already provided evidence this is wrong. 

>More than global warming, it's climate volatility. Yes, it's drier in some areas, it's also wetter in other areas. Much wetter. It's warmer in some parts, it's colder in some parts. 

Yes, that's how this works. 

>The drying out thing is such BS. Places have gone from lush to arid and back to lush, with and without human influence.

Provide your evidence. 

>Very high CO2? This isn't very high. This is well within the safe level. When it gets colder again within a decade, will you be the first to admit you were misled and that other factors are at play? I have doubts. 

Evidence? 

>Going along wtih a fabricated consensus about something that you don't understand just so you can say ""I'm right, you're wrong"" is a weak play.

I don't get anything by providing evidence to people who have been suckered into believing anthropogenic climate change isn't serious. It makes me sad people are so scared of being wrong they'll refuse to read anything that could possibly undermine their uneducated opinion. I also really wish human impacts weren't changing the environment. The world would be much easier. That simply isn't true. 

>I'll admit CO2 has an effect on climate, but not the micro amount that humans contribute, and I'm also well aware that Earth's climate is affected by many other factors, a fact that people like you seem to have trouble with.

Wrong. Already provided you with extensive evidence of this.

Politics,comment,climate,kotma3y,GozerDidNothingWrong,,"I remember 2024, people were still joking about climate change, some people were even still able to make a career trying to convince people it wasn't real.  By February most everyone in the world had become aware that this year was unusual, that woodchuck actually got the early spring prediction event correct.   But the bigger news was that January was a +3.5F deviation from the previous year, no one really got freaked out about it.  People kept talking how dry the spring was, people complained that the maple syrup harvest was disappointing; many harvests were lower than expected that year already there had been others reported like peaches in Georgia.

Then the kitschy news story was about how, when was it going to rain? It didn't come, but the fires did, so many fires everywhere it was like the whole world was burning all at once, people posted more photos of how New York looks like an apocalyptic orange hellscape and how their allergies were insane this year and they totally can't breathe!  Scientists at Mauna Kea reported the single biggest jump in CO2 from year over year in March about how it jumped by 10PPM to 440PPM; every time they showed up on TV they just ended up screaming at the camera, they went viral.

Then April came, the super heated March that had meant 90F in places like Wisconsin went to a monsoon that just did not stop for days.  The hard dried soil that farmers had bemoaned had required pumping more water to get crops growing meant that so many cities were flooded that what hadn't burned was now a hopeless decimation of mold and rot as millions suddenly became homeless forced to take refuge where they could the government agreed to pay rent/mortgage for the year in any property that was still available for people who had lost their homes.

No one really thought too much about how now millions would change addresses for that all important date in November and that this would come to be the pivotal issue when election fraud was decried again in December.  

But I'm getting ahead of myself, the monsoon in April and subsequent flooding are now draining and the land drying and suddenly the temperature dropping will cause a massive low pressure drawing cold polar air south, down to New Orleans freezing weather for a fortnight in May decimating agriculture specifically east of the Rockies, it decimates Southern crops adversely decreasing crop yields.  That which survives in mountain valleys is further decimated due to decreased sunlight from atmospheric soot blocking sunlight, this has the profound effect of limiting the amount of vitamin D especially in the northern hemisphere where the smoke from the spring fires burned the dry deadwood from winter.

The lack of vegetables meant that folic acid was reduced so that folate was not available, these two factors meant that pregnant women in northern climates were prone to birth defects at disproportionate rates incidental to the increase in melanin in skin.  States that had banned abortion for pregnancies that have developmental issues means that the doctors left burnout as they see more and more human tragedy everyday.

June was the coolest that summer was for the year, it also didn't snow, but there was freezing rain. 

So much went wrong that year, but it all came down to a toss of the dice.",2024-02-04T02:07:55+00:00,t3_1ai23yg

Neo-liberal policies seem to have unsettled the middle-class and created a lot of economic and social hardship in the last few decades. And when people want change, being the guy in charge would seem rather disadvantageous to me. You can also rest assured that countries like Russia and Saudi-Arabia will work to create some extra misery just before the election (raising fuel prices, maybe starting a new offensive in Ukraine etc).

gotta say, i think gas buddy does a better job at representing the variations than your personal experience.  if i had to take a bet, the area your in is at fault for you being on the upper bounds.

Climatechange,comment,warming,k8k8yuy,aaronturing,,"This is hilarious. It's even in the title. It's clearly an issue isn't it.

It is good that you provided that link though however it shows the flaws in the science.

""Because our planet is warmer, on average, the hot days are becoming hotter. And, because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, rain storms are growing more intense. Warmer oceans are also producing stronger hurricanes.""

This shows how poor the attribution science really is. Did you know how weather predictions work ? They have the ability to state well there is a 70% chance of rain next week or whenever based  on current measurements and historical data about how weather works.

At the moment all they can do is attribute weather event x to climate change and state is shouldn't have occurred this much. It has basically no predictive capability in relation to localized events.

The kicker is that if you don't have an extreme weather event the argument will be well then climate change isn't real which clearly isn't true.",2023-11-09T22:00:13+00:00,t1_k8k7xa1

You can add emissions linked to imported and exported products depending on what you want to measure and that is a tricky part.

Even during his time as VP there was basically no coverage of him because Obama was like a blinding light to these moths.  Obama totally shielded Joe from the searing hatred of the conservosphere.
