A last-minute move from President Biden to claim executive privilege over audio recordings from his interview with special counsel Robert Hur did not dissuade the GOP from proceeding, even as Garland said those asserting the privilege ‚Äúcannot be prosecuted for criminal contempt of Congress.‚Äù

The House Judiciary Committee passed the measure in an 18-15 party line vote, while the House Oversight Committee did the same in a 24-20 vote hours later.

Conservative,comment,l4dk327,SG_665667,,"Around 2018/2019, I remember watching a video of one of the campus protests that sprang up every other month. One was in California--I think near Berkeley. 

A group of college guys were protesting, when one of them asked cameraman: ""Did you vote for Trump?"" The cameraman said yes, and the guy *immediately* punched him in the face. A cop must've seen it, because he ran over and started putting the kid in cuffs. **Every last person** in the group that was with the attacker--who saw what happened since they were right there with him--immediately started saying: ""*Officer, he punched him in self-defense! It was self-defense! We saw it! It was self-defense!*""

Now, bearing that in mind, Perry's conviction was a case where the *only* witnesses to what actually happened (apart from Perry) were all far-left protestors. Should anyone really have taken their word that the guy Perry shot was being non-threatening, especially since Perry had a Trump sticker on his car bumper?  *This* was a case of self-defense, without question.

And he lost very few times (32 times). He was plaintiff in 1900 of them. Defendant in 1400. Check it out. As usual the Left just like to chime bs... ""Trump's been in court 4000 times!"" Padding that number some 500 cases, first of all. But why, and how did it go? Pretty swimmingly for Trump. And it's really, really looking like this trial he's presently in is going very well for him too. It couldn't have gone better that his former lawyer, Cohen, may have lied and harboring a personal vendetta against Trump. Stranger than fiction. Is this really happening, or is this some sort of ingenious master plan to make the prosecutor out to be a fool. See if Trump pardons Cohen after the election. Who knows.

Ok, Slow... can I call you Slow?  Ok Slow, allow me to establish a basic premiss for you; in America, before it was a Banana Republic, all American citizens were supposed to be presumed innocent *until* proven guilty.  If you want to live in fantasy land where being accused of a thing makes you automatically guilty of that thing, go for it.  In fact, many countries out in the world operate precisely like that.  Go there.  Get lost.  

Now, you are asking me if Trump would lose my support if the pendulum were to swing the other way?  Absolutely not.  Why would it?  Biden/Libs are establishing a Banana Republic where political prosecution is an acceptable practice.  It would be foolish if the Right were to play by a different set of rules.

Conservative,comment,l4cgv57,Sallowjoe,,"> How much do you want to bet her research interest in ""poor whites"" is to label them racists?

The category is a ""social construction"" on her account -

> Through attention to racial and class formations deployed by philanthropic organizations and social scientists in the United States and South Africa, I consider the politics of scientific racism and civilizing missions in particular with regard to the construction of the social identity ‚Äúpoor whites.‚Äù 

Literally everything is a ""social construction"" for many social scientists, though, so to figure out WTF that means we have to dig a bit deeper. I was skeptical but it seems she's far from the worst SJW type of character on the issue. Her research does seem to include *some* real history, she summarizes it in a book talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_wV5CEDv9g) if anyone is curious.

As South Africa industrialized it resulted in a big urban/rural divide in which many rural whites economically struggled compared to other demographics as white business owners weren't hiring them. The South African government developed a program to promote hiring them because it did have racist interests in unifying white groups. So ""poor whites"" becomes a kind of census category. Basically it's an example of affirmative action for rural whites in the early 1900s in South Africa.

So in this special case we do have a quite literally socially constructed category, to be fair, and poor (rural) white people are subject to various forms of discrimination themselves by other white people and in some cases not even considered the same racial category as wealthy white groups. Race ends up not trumping economics for them, in this context. 

That all said she also thinks there are cross-nation global efforts involved in the racist policies of various different nations such that comparative studies of race politics in nation A vs. B doesn't tell the complete story. Multinational movements, including wealthy philanthropic institutions, were involved in creating white identity across nations and pushing for segregation, often for the sake of securing their own political power. 

So you could say she thinks many poor whites were to an extent intentionally pushed toward racism over time by wealthy special interest groups. This included attempting to shame them in various ways for associating with non-whites or for being in positions of lower socio-economic status than them.

She also mentions an interest in ""a more humanizing account of impoverished white people"", so she does seem intent on not just labeling them racist and calling it a day, if you take her word for it anyway.",2024-05-16T18:52:36+00:00

Conservative,comment,l4bzhkv,Winterclaw42,,"I'm a moderate on the environment and activists/cultists/grifters/socialist are one of the two things that's causing me to be extra skeptical with it.  Humans are doing something to the planet, even if it is only on a lot of small scales, but the problem is I don't trust the people in charge to give an honest answer.  Now add in to that a history of trying to suppress the other side and I really question if real science can happen in the current year on this issue.  Take recycling.  It's a scam and 90-95% of the stuff goes to a landfill in asia anyways.  

The other issue is I feel like there could be solutions that don't involve questionable EVs, eating ze bugs, or living like unbathed hippies.  Nuclear energy is an obvious answer and if we drill like 2 dozen 18 inch across, mile deep holes on site, we can deal with the waste.  Building nuclear plants would give us the energy for other uses.

Then there's the elephant in the room: we need 2nd and 3rd world economies to become 1st world economies.  At that point they can afford to care about the environment.",2024-05-16T17:12:35+00:00

Conservative,comment,l4bq2q4,Ticonderogue,,"Some years back, a lot of fast food raised their prices, even before Covid, and the only way you could get a fair deal was using the app or a coupon. With McDs, everyday there's a deal on the app for $6.59 meal (with few meal exceptions). That's the only way I'd still eat there. The deal with apps is, they want your data. Who you are, birthday, where you live, what you eat, how frequently you dine out, etc. I deny them all that There's no credit card affixed to my app, no permissions given except location (and only when using the app), which better helps you select the correct McDs location.

Many fast food appear to have reduced portion size while also raising prices. Chick-fil-A used to have a thicker chicken breast on their sandwiches. Now it often doesn't even cover the width of the bun. Some went from whole lettuce to shredded. Or one large slice of tomato to three pathetic slices of tomato. In any case, you gotta play smart and use apps or coupons to get a fair deal at fast food. And when one location doesn't do a good job, you be sure to review them online. I've helped shut down grossly mismanaged... Burger King, a Whataburger, and a Sonics in my immediate area. I'd go though the drive thru, only car there, and wait 20 mins. Inexcusable. One manager pretended not to speak English, but asked a worker to translate for her... and he heard me, looked at her and repeated what I said... in English. Is that racism? The only fast food burger joint on one particular stretch of a main road is the same McDs that's been there for 40 years. They're consistent any way. Compete and win customers, hustle, be fair and honest, or go out of business.

I think a lot of restaurants raised prices over the last few years simply because they could. A few did it, and then everyone else followed. Now they're finding out, hopefully, that's not working. But I do hope we see some restaurants go out of business. Have you seen the menu at Olive Garden lately, they think they're worth $25+ a meal? I used to be a server at the #2 busiest OG in the country. They used to put more meat in their sauces, and prices were reasonable. You can do so much better finding a mom and pop Italian restaurant. It used to be that when you couldn't get more customers or customers shrink, you lowered priced. But anymore they instead raise prices on the customers that continue to go there. Everything looks and feels like California. The more people leave CA because of high taxes, the more they raise taxes. They never understand. Disney was struggling to keep their parks full, but instead of lowering prices to encourage attendance, they raised prices. Chick-fil-A has two lines that wrap around their building all day, every day, and you'd think their competition would take notice. But it doesn't seem like it. The restaurant business is a volume business. Volume business in fast food should mean... cheap eats. $10-12 for a crummy burger with wilted toppings, medium fries and a drink that's half ice (unless you specify otherwise) isn't cheap. And it's not sustainable, hopefully.",2024-05-16T16:18:37+00:00

Combine that information with the fact that their revenues have started growing since 2020 after shrinking for the half decade prior to that, I wouldn't bet against McDonalds.

Especially considering the margins, it's pretty clear the price doubling is more of a reflection of a weaker dollar combined with actual increased production costs (labor, energy, rent, ingredients).",2024-05-16T18:12:57+00:00

Conservative,comment,l4anmzh,Wookieebalboa,,"This man‚Äôs words needs to be heard/read by everyone:

‚ÄúThank you, Your Honor. I appreciate it. Family, friends, and allies and foundationalists and honored adversaries, today we enter the next phase in the fight to protect our God-given rights from a government that wishes to take them from us and grant us mere privileges in return. To quote another patriot from another place and time, ""This is not the end. This is not even the beginning of the end. This is perhaps, the end of the beginning.""

And so, as we enter this new phase, there should be no question in the mind of any patriotic American as to why we fight. After all, only slaves lack the right to arm self-defense and we are no slaves, but free citizens of a great republic and we contain multitudes each of us from builder, a healer, a teacher, a statesman, a soldier, a judge, an attorney at law, a sergeant at arms, and an image of God. So, we know why we fight.

The question before us is how we must fight. What kind of discipline we must bring with us into battle and what spirit we must show to our friends and adversaries alike and by way of answering, we refer to our core doctrines.

The foundationalist's manifesto calls us to listen closely and to speak clearly. To deny the self at the same time to defend the individual. To respect tradition and also to cultivate the future. In short, as foundationalists, we are called to embrace disciplines that seem to contradict each other but nonetheless, to embrace them with all of our strength.

So, it is in our current fight because this system as dysfunctional as it often is, as unjust as it often is, it is nonetheless, our system. It is a feature not a bug of our American civilization. Like any other structure built from man's crooked timber, it is not perfect. Judges and attorneys and trial courts and juries in the light of day are not perfect. Judges and attorneys and trial courts and juries in the light of day are merely what we have instead of the blood feud and the vendetta and the dagger in the dead of night.

Knowing this, we give challenge even as we give thanks. Knowing this, we prepare ourselves for battle in a spirit of profound dissatisfaction and profound gratitude in equal measure.

That is the apparent contradiction we face as we continue this struggle for the civil rights of our fellow New Yorkers and our fellow Americans. On the one hand, to hate this system, our system enough to fight it but on the other hand, to love it enough, love it enough to think it's worth fighting for. Nothing else will do for us but this profoundly Christian habit of defeating a contradiction by fully embracing both sides of it.

So, when our adversaries look for us let them find ‚Äì to  quote my Christian friend ""A bee shiniest at a wasp's hostility."" Let us show them a soldier's intensity and diplomat's calm. Let our adversaries find us stern in battle, patient in defeat, and gracious in our ultimate victory which is certain. In short, when our adversaries look for us, let them find reasonable men and irrational patriots.

When I was a boy my grandfather told me that fire is a great servant, but a terrible master and so it is with Government. And to the extent that our own Government attempts to be our master, we must oppose it. We must fight to the utmost limits of our strength, but in that fight, our spirit must be one of restoration, not destruction. We must confront the enemy as the firefighter confronts his enemy and for the same reasons that the structure itself may yet, be saved.

God bless and keep you all and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you, Your Honor.‚Äù

He was making several ghost guns which aren't registered firearms, though I question if they would even work. That is directly against the law to do in NY, though it's allowed in some states. He was also building hand guns and you need a firearms permit in NY to own them. Disagreeing with the law and thinking the punishment for breaking them is BS doesn't give you license to do whatever you want, and I think for your own safety you should follow your states gun laws. The morality of the two laws is a separate issue.

Counterpoint: 

Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be ""cured"" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.

The  death penalty should be abolished even if the court system wasn't as problematic as it is. The sentencing for minor repeated crimes like possession of drugs being so severe fucks up the whole system. When punishment for major one-off crimes is lower than having weed on you three times, there just is no justice to be had. Punishment for SA against a minor should be severe. But if there is an inflation of punishment across all crimes, you would have to punish it even harder, which is what we see here. We should base our punishment on data, not emotion.
Having the punishment so high will statistically lower the number of children reporting crimes against them, as another person said, it is most likely  a person the child knows that has committed the crime, giving them the death penalty will make it less likely that the child will to report the SA, in fear of the person getting killed.

It doesn‚Äôt violate the constitution it says you need a license. Not that you aren‚Äôt allowed to carry.

The Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual's right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home. New York‚Äôs proper-cause requirement violates the Fourteenth Amendment in that it prevents law-abiding citizens with ordinary self-defense needs from exercising their right to keep and bear arms.

Honestly, the future is bleak and I am not sure either candidate will pull us out of this tailspin we are in. Try to minimize your personal debt and enjoy relative stability while it lasts.

Basically we couldn't get students suspended or sent home for fighting, destroying property, etc because they lacked ""privilege"" and punishing them would only further reinforce societal ""discrimination."" We needed to be good little social justice warrior teachers and allow students to impede on the rights of others to an education and teachers to teach.

Instead of viewing the rights of others students who want to learn in a peaceful orderly classroom as worth protecting, it was all about siding with the trouble making students. A student flips a desk , cusses someone out and throws school property? Take them for a walk, give them a bag of chips and have a talk.

The war in Ukraine is entirely different from Vietnam. The war in Gaza is entirely different from Afghanistan. Once again, if you don‚Äôt see that, you don‚Äôt have a good understanding of international politics.

And once again, we can absolutely do both. We can help out our allies abroad and defeat our international adversaries while also fixing our problems at home. Biden is just choosing not to.

Conservative,comment,l463v09,each_thread,,">The reality is that Democrats are weaker than they have been for at least 10 years, and they are going to become even weaker, as current economic events and an increasingly intransigent cadre of far-left activists chip away at their base.

This article assumes the election will be determined by voters rather than by a Sisonite guman. The Democrats can keep Biden safe in part by holding a virtual convention. Interestingly, the Democrats are looking to incarcerate Trump, which will make it easier for the Secret Service to protect him. Are the Democrats afraid about what will happen if Trump remains vulnerable from his frequent traveling?

If Trump is taken out, Biden will have to face an election against RFK Jr. directly. In that case, it makes sense why they would want to keep Trump safe from would be Sirhan Sirhans. Also, incarceration would hurt Trump's ability to campaign and that must be part of their thinking.

Historically Government sets a policy. If the desired result is achieved, great. If not, government doubles down, triples down.  There is mo penalty for poor results and performance.

Trump runs the government like a business. He sets a policy. If the desired result is not achieved, he pivots by either adjusting the policy to fix the unexpected parts or changes to a completely new policy until the desired result is achieved.

Not debating is worse for the Democrats than it would be for Trump. The assumption is Biden can't be coherent enough to do a debate. Making excuses like ""well Trump didn't debate his own parties candidates"" won't hold water. It would confirm what many already think - hes cognitively gone. 

Biden's only chance is to do the debates, and maintain some semblance coherent speech. The media will provide air cover and gas light the masses if he can muster up that bare minimum.",2024-05-15T15:01:09+00:00

Not only that but it's without an audience which allows the biased moderator to control how exchanges between the candidates are perceived (as they fill the role of the missing audience).

Your comment is nothing but projection. You are the one that fears the reality that the democrats are corrupt and need to rig everything against Trump. That's why you need to ignore the evidence that proves they did and are continuing to do exactly that.

>""The American flag shouldn't trigger them, but it does,"" said Lax.

>The protesters called the flag a ""Fascist Symbol"" and ""Nazi Flag."" One activist allegedly threatened to ""F***k him up,"" and one person attempted to grab the flag through the chain link fence, he said.

>Lax shared on Monday a social media post by a student calling for the targeting of Lax that was approved of by the Kingsborough Community College Muslim Student Association, which organized the protest along with CUNY for Palestine, Within Our Lifetime, and Palestinian Youth Movement.

The second debate took place on October 9, **and the third took place on October 19.**


Biden highly benefitted from only two debates in 2020.  Somehow, both of those debates were almost entirely about Race and Covid.  Both of them.

They killed off critical thinking and reasoning in my high school decades ago.  It was pointless to even try teaching most of the students how to use the brains God gave them, they honestly didn't care.

My high school was essentially a job training center for local factory work.  Still is.  Most of the public schools in this entire region (Great Lakes) are nothing more than temporary holding cells for urban youth and factory job recruitment centers.  These kids have no ambition beyond getting a job with Amazon or something similar.

Why?  Because that's all the ambition their parents have.  If the parents are even around, that is.

We need to understand that there are fundamental societal reasons why governmental systems like feudalism remain stable for such extended periods of time.  Despite the hope of our Founding Fathers, not everyone is created equal.  There are those meant to lead, and those meant to follow.  Nobles....and peasants.

And every time you allow the peasants ideas above their stations you get....well, look around.  Like what you see?

Even in their idealism, the Founding Fathers understood these most basic facts.  Which is why they maintained so many feudalist practices in their brave new government and quietly left a couple of doors open to return to the natural order of feudalism.  They saw even then that society still has not evolved sufficiently beyond the ""me, me, me"" stage to be able to accept the full responsibility necessary to maintain a stable Democratically elected government.  The peasants simply cannot think past tomorrow.",2024-05-15T11:38:04+00:00

I was in a program studying labor history, the head of the program was a publicly avowed member of the communist party.  His name was Ron Woodbury.

this was 1973 or 74...  the school opened in 72 or 73...  I was 19 or 20.  I had managed to avoid the draft simply because they stopped it as they were taking boys from my birth year.  

  
I was in a roundtable discussion with my group, and I referred to some of my female high school friends as ""girls"".  Some of the women objected to my using the word, and demanded I not use it.  I declined, and said my friends would be ok with it, so no, I won't submit.

  
the professor told me I had to or I would be kicked out of the program.  this was my only course, it was a full credit program.

I would argue it's a very big deal. I get that some students really don't care. But are you suggesting that schools teach to those students rather than to the ones that do care? What about the students who do want to use the brains God gave them?

As for ""*And every time you allow the peasants ideas above their stations you get....well, look around. Like what you see*?"", this is due to a lack of thinking not an excess of it.

The same outcome can happen with benzodiazepine abuse as they both act on the same neurotransmitter. 

Interestingly, opiate addicts going through withdrawal might feel like they are dying but won‚Äôt actually die. This program is likely being abused and comes at a huge financial cost, but the idea behind is to prevent death, or prevent ERs from being clogged with patients needing medical treatment for alcohol withdrawal.

Some of them don't work, but the reason many of them are coming here is because they can make a life altering amount of money. 

In their home country wages can be $30 a day. In the US with the right skillset in the right area, they can make that in a couple of hours. That's the difference between a kid going hungry and a kid being able go to school while still having enough left over to take care of aging grandparents. 

One of the odd side effects of the battle to keep people out is migrant workers used to go home in the off season then return in again in the spring. But with the border getting increasingly dangerous and expensive to cross, many people stay here year round rather than risk not making it back. 

In my perfect world there would be a far more robust foreign work program that allowed people to pass a background check before safely coming here without having to pay cartel smugglers, pay taxes on their wages that were set at a fair rate, then return home at the end of the season. I suppose my real perfect world would be American workers doing that, but I don't think the country is ready to rip the fair wage bandaid off that quickly, so wages would need to be increased yearly until they were on par with what Americans would require.",2024-05-14T19:05:43+00:00

Worth noting that the total number of immigrants stayed pretty stable during the 1910's to 1970's, but the domestic birth rate was so high the relative percentage of foreign-born people dropped.

Those numbers from google AI are interesting, if they are not just fabricated on the spot haha. If the numbers are to be believed, we could run those numbers off of like the census and see how they compare, at least with how many foreigners arrived each year.

To use 1900, because it was a census year, according to wikipedia, the national pop was 76, 212,768.

[Kerry Mullis, the inventer of PCR](https://files.catbox.moe/nd5o28.mp4)

In the simplest terms, the way PCR works is that it takes a single strand of DNA and makes millions of copies of it to ""amplify"" whats there. Each time it does this is called a cycle.  Remember, they were using up to 40 cycles of PCR to determine if someone had covid. And to even use the test for this they had to convert the RNA to DNA.

Unfortunately, Kerry Mullis died in Oct 2019, and therefore couldn't speak out about how his test may or may not be the best method.",2024-05-14T16:59:46+00:00

EDIT: I'd wager to say a key factor in the high mortality rate is likely to be the underreporting of total cases, especially since the bulk of them come from 3rd world countries. I'd imagine unless the cases got really serious, tons of lesser severity cases probably went completely unreported, which would lower the overall mortality rate. Also need to consider the lack of healthcare access in those countries as well, which will contribute to a higher mortality rate. In other words, I seriously doubt it's as scary as they're making it out to be.",2024-05-14T15:53:12+00:00

Conservative,comment,l3z0hzt,Brussel_Rand,,"What a weird article. First of all, 2017 is when female scouts were announced not allowed to join, that was 2019. While it's common for male and female troops to intermingle as families can bring their sons and daughters on shared trips, there's a lot of segregation as girls can't join boy troops and vice versa. So I'm inclined to be skeptical of this article if it's clear the integrity is lacking. If you've ever worked with female scouts you would know that while they present their own challenges, they were easily welcomed and everyone is happier for it. 

The article tangents all over the place talking about men's issues, and the scatter shot doesn't really pertain to the topic at hand. There's reasons why people are leaving the BSA. A lot of it is fears of assault and any given modern issue like kids not touching grass. There are some progressive values being put into the system, but none that are too annoying to deal with. They have a propensity to favor hiring certain demographics sure, but nothing that truly crosses the line in the sand. Stuff like getting rid of certain songs and skits that leaders arbitrarily decide isn't okay, but then again troops don't always feel the need to follow the rules imposed on them for better or worse.",2024-05-14T07:54:14+00:00

Also evidence can deteriorate or be lost, and witnesses' memories can fade.

Conservative,comment,l423oqz,best-commenter-ever,,"Sorry, counselor, but your evidence is lacking.  

Look, lets lay our cards out on the table.  You're still irritated because I made a small joke after you called yourself a lawyer.  I did not mean to mock you, I was just making the point that personal credentials don't really count on an anonymous forum unless you're doing an AMA or something like that.  I do it myself sometimes, i wasn't really even mocking you, I was just being silly.  I do apologize, though, for hurting your feelings, that was not my intention and I will try not to do it again in the future.  

As for me being a leftist troll, I DO indeed have a history of commenting on this sub in favor of small government, 2a rights, and pro-life policies.  I don't care for Joe Biden, and I've made posts against his policies.  I like Mitt Romney and John McCain, and I've made posts in support of them. You are free to scroll through my history like a creepy stalker and verify that if you want. 

But this stuff with Donald Trump has nothing to do with being liberal or conservative; it's either he did it or he didn't.  I don't get emotionally attached to candidates, because in the end, they will almost always let you down.  I follow ideas.  I would hope as an attorney you have a similar ethos.",2024-05-14T20:46:25+00:00
Conservative,comment,l45a14j,best-commenter-ever,,"Hmmmm.....good point.   I did what you said, slept on it, took a long hard look in the mirror, and looked through all tue sources and witnesses again.  

The most damning were the two women who said that they were similarly sexually assaulted by trump. That really corroborated his MO with these things.  Of course, introducing the Access Hollywood tape was like a nice F you on top of that because now he admits this is the kind of thing he likes to do.  The two friends also provide a level of corroboration that is fairly rare, so that still carries some weight with me.  Then there was Carroll's testimony itself, which I found credible. Btw, that therapist turned out to have some pretty solid credentials, so even though she wasn't told in the 90's when it happened, she said her account was also credible, which added weight for me.

The reality is that Israel does not perform non-religious civil unions at all, however if you were married elsewhere they will legally recognize it. (Edit - as of 2020 non religious civil unions can be performed in Tel Aviv) Whereas in Gaza same sex acts, let alone marriage, are still illegal though not universally enforced. It turns out LGBTQ rights are not protected at all in Palestine, to the contrary many are outright illegal. However, it seems that generally speaking the laws are only enforced if you were reported to the authorities. Otherwise, the laws wouldn‚Äôt be enforced unless there was some kind of special circumstance to warrant an investigation. So there is some nuance to the issue in Palestine.

To even think, let alone argue, that Palestine has better rights for LGBTQ+ people is willfully ignorant at best and at worst intentionally lying and spreading misinformation to support a narrative. Israel protects LGBTQ+ people against discrimination, allows sex changes, allows them do adopt, recognizes their marriage, etc. Israel‚Äôs LGBTQ rights mostly lines up with other western democracies‚Äô laws, to think otherwise is just plain wrong.",2024-05-14T06:30:29+00:00

There is definitely step to far in a lot of this but the general treatment of Palastinians warrants condemnation by US well preceding the Oct 7th attacks.  The US in the Bush era and Israel since has done everything to create a generational powderkeg of disaffected youth with nothing to lose.  They've empowed Hamas through a failure to give any victories to moderates (Fatah or Palastinian Authority) to be able to hoist within their community on issues of territorial sovernty, recognition of basic human rights, and aknowlgement of the validity of governing bodies. They've allowed continued encroachment on Palastinian territory through settlements and furthered their treatment of the Palastinian people as little more than cattle to be hearded into an ever shrinking pasture through apartied walls, blockades and dehumnization.  

I understand the motivations and reality of the current war, there was no acceptable answer other than to destroy Hamas for their vile acts of rape an murder and as they're ingrained in every aspect of Gaza, that surely means complete destruction but I honestly don't see how Israel at this point returns Gaza to the Palastinians.  They've leveled almost everything with the completion of that coming as they push south and the political will to allow re-establisment of any kind of normal life for Palastinians will be non-existant within the Knesset.  

This isn't some solution to things, I'm really in no position to have one, but I do understand the anger that we just poured billions into what will likely be the erradication of the homeland of a people who were largely born into a life with no hope.  Hamas is a scourge, Netenyau is a power hungry politician that never saw any benefit to acknowledging the Palastinian people, and we're somehow mixed up in this to the point where our muntions are the ones being used to to level city blocks and pour the blood of innocent civilians into the streets.",2024-05-14T03:40:24+00:00

Conservative,comment,l3zufif,Batbuckleyourpants,,">James is correct that the University of California, Davis researchers who conducted a 2019 study on abortion pill reversal canceled their work, citing the ‚Äúrisk to women.‚Äù The ‚Äúrisk‚Äù in question, however, came after three of the 12 women who took mifepristone, the abortion drug, for the sake of the study ‚Äúrequired ambulance transport to a hospital for treatment of severe vaginal bleeding.‚Äù Two of them hadn‚Äôt ingested any reversal drug.

>James‚Äô targeting of pregnancy centers over a life-saving treatment that she says lacks ‚Äúsafety and effectiveness‚Äù is ironic given the abortion pill‚Äôs proven history of causing dangerous and sometimes fatal complications.

>Mifepristone is responsible for a 500 percent increase in abortion-related emergency room visits for side effects such as hemorrhage, ‚Äúfast, weak pulse,‚Äù ‚Äúshortness of breath,‚Äù diarrhea, dizziness, headache, vomiting, ‚Äúpain‚Äù across the back, arms, neck, and abdomen, and myriad other risks.

Conservative,comment,l3y7kf7,homestar92,,"Regardless of whether you believe there was cheating or not, the Democrats were also playing chess while the Republicans played checkers in 2020. The Republicans, as they so often do, snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. As much as we all made fun of Biden for ""hiding in his basement"", that's the most effective way to campaign against the human wrecking ball that is Donald Trump.

Ballot harvesting, heavily promoting early and absentee voting, and just sitting back and letting their opponent talk uncontested so as to create sound bites for attack ads were all completely legal tactics they used in their campaign which the Republican party did not embrace. Republicans got caught up in playing the game that they think we ought to be playing rather than the one that we are. This is some admirable idealism, but the reality is, absentee and early voting without even so much as providing a reason why you wish to vote absentee is the reality in most, if not all states - and the GOP needs to realize that and play the game that we're in so that they can win some semblance of power to potentially change the game to the one they want.

You'll notice that Trump changed his tune on early voting this time around. We've seen how the ""election day voting or bust"" strategy didn't work out - look at the 2022 Nevada senate race. There was a snowstorm in very red parts of northern NV on election day that year. The race was decided by less than 8000 votes. Perhaps if Republicans had not been actively discouraging early voting, the snowstorm would have been less relevant and the senate would be 50/50 right now and we'd be looking at an absolute worst-case scenario of 51 seats in 2024 rather than the potential 50/50 scenario we've got now if election day goes poorly for Republicans.",2024-05-14T03:02:29+00:00

Its the consequences of those political views, namely extreme lenience for violent criminals, not the political views themselves.

>the government killing citizens for crimes short of murder or treason

The 8th Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. Whether capital punishment for something as vile as human trafficking is ""cruel"" is pretty much just subjective opinion. Capital punishment for crimes like rape was not uncommon through most of the nation's history, and was only deemed to be ""cruel"" fairly recently, and by the same court that decided the 4th Amendment somehow protected a ""right"" to abortion.",2024-05-13T20:39:38+00:00

1) National Guard to patrol streets - if people are getting shot because the local DA won't prosecute criminals, then those gun toting criminals should be prosecuted federally.  National Guard, FBI, whatever.

2) Death penalty for crimes other than murder - I personally am against the death penalty in all cases - but the conservative argument for increasing the death pentalty is the law and order argument.  Beefing up penalties for crimes, including the death penalty, is a conservative plank and has been so forever.  That said, to execute a human trafficker would probably need to require severe circumstances.  Even if Trump gets his way, it's just not possible to lower the bar to the level where single human trafficking conviction gets the chair.  It would have to be an aggrevated case, as in the trafficker's actions led to someone's death - happens all the time actually.

Sure, everything is more expensive, but it's the lack of stable marriages as well. If over 50% of your population isn't in a long-lasting stable marriage, many people will opt-out of having any kids.  
  
There are many, many women who still want kids, but can't afford it on their own and can't find anyone decent to marry. Even for the many women who find a ""partner"", said partner won't marry them and/or won't have kids with them.   
  
Most men don't care about not having kids. Women generally do want kids, but if men won't marry them and won't agree to having kids, responsible women won't have kids.  
  
  
Men now see marriage and kids as a financial burden with no reward. They can get sex without it.   
  
Women see kids as a financial burden usually because they have no stable man to raise kids with.  
  
Some really rich women are turning to sperm banks or adoption centers, but most women can't afford that, nor afford to raise a child on their own. And it still deprives the child of a father figure, which generates a host of bad issues.  
  
Childcare costs are awful, but the marriage rates are also awful. You aren't going to have tons of children without tons of long-lasting marriages first.  
  
There's a ton of single women who would opt to have kids on their own if they could afford it, since they've totally given up on men ever wanting to marry or have kids. It's why we see so many single women buying a house on their own and having multiple pet dogs. They've started their ""family"" on their own without a man because they've had no choice. A house and multiple dogs is still faaar cheaper than trying to go the sperm bank route and try to afford raising a child on your own.   
  
I don't think anything would change mens' minds about having kids or getting married unless they were no longer allowed sex outside of marriage. And even that is no guarantee because plenty of men have turned to porn so they don't even have to bother trying to date.

I'm all for making it easier for people to have kids, it truly is hard to afford them. My wife and I have already spent 20k in fertility treatments to have kids of our own.

Conservative,comment,l3xpzhe,FuzzyJury,,"I was listening to an episode of Louise Perry‚Äôs podcast recently where she was interviewing an Israeli woman about why Israel is one of the only developed countries to having a rising birth rate instead of a falling birth rate. A lot of the answer seemed to be about the normalization of children in all aspects of society, like how it‚Äôs common and no big deal to bring babies to a work conference,  and living within walking distance or otherwise close to extended family. 


For the US, I think there are several areas we could work on to foster such a culture here or to otherwise encourage families: 


1) Housing. We desperately need more housing so that prices fall and it can keep up with demand. To that end, I think we need to deregulate a lot of our zoning laws. Grandparents are often in very different economic circumstances than their adult children with families, and it tends to keep them living further away. I think if we had more areas that were mixed-use, such as having both larger houses, smaller houses, townhomes, apartments, etc in closer distances to one another, it would help generations at different economic points to live close to each other. Also deregulating building ADUs. I know for my husband and myself personally, he has been fortunate to be extremely successful with his career, and where we have to live as a result is really out of price range for my recently retired parents. They would love to move closer to us but the closest areas are an hour or so away and not great neighborhoods. It would be great if we had more houses built in general to bring housing prices down, and also had mixed use areas so that my parents could live in a smaller house or townhome that‚Äôs still close to us, and maybe things like corner convenience stores so that when they are no longer able to drive, they don‚Äôt have to once again move. 

2) University Degree and certification reform. So many young people, and especially young woman, are devoting most of their twenties, their most crucial years for finding a relationship and starting a family, to just obtaining the credentialing needed for a fighting chance at a number of jobs. A college degree is mostly meaningless now for many white collar professions, more and more we need advanced degrees, with many people not even starting to find jobs until the age of 25 at the earliest. I think we should go the way of a number of different countries that have direct paths to, say, practicing law or medicine without first getting some four year liberal arts degree. We also need way more investment in trade schools and community colleges, and to reform the skills that are being taught to match the current economic landscape. I think shaving years off of what is needed to enter different job markets can help young people think of prioritizing families sooner. 


So yea, TLDR, I truly think that building more housing so that housing costs come down, reforming zoning so that retirees can afford to purchase more suitable homes next to their adult children (or the reverse, so young families just starting on their careers can afford places next to their more established parents), and relaxing our growing credentialing bureaucracies and reforming other profession-gatekeeping institutions to shave costs and years off of the ability to find one‚Äôs preferred job are all essential to promoting more families. And I would also add that I‚Äôd like to see more brainstorming on more ways to normalize kids in everyday life, even bringing babies on work conferences, which sounds odd to our American ears. 


Unrelated, but I don‚Äôt think any of these ideas or more are particularly partisan. I could see how ‚Äúeach side‚Äù would attack them for seeming to be in support of the ‚Äúother side.‚Äù That type of partisanship is so harmful and counterproductive.

This does make one wonder, why is the cultural attitude towards large families so much more favorable? I hypothesized that some reasons are types of housing/proximity to extended family, and it being normal to bring kids to all sorts of things. But then why is that? 


So this is me just guessing, but I think that for most Jewish people, faith is not really emphasized as much as doing things/participating in traditions. So like, you can be an atheist but it‚Äôs still pretty normal to have bar or bat mitzvahs, go to shul for at the very least Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, have big gatherings for Passover and Chanukah, etc. and I don‚Äôt think that there is necessarily a pro-natalist message per se at any of these events, so much as you‚Äôre exposed to more people of different ages, different stages in life, a wider range of experience, etc. 


For all American liberals like to think of themselves as ‚Äúdiverse,‚Äù their diversity is often just cosmetic and is mainly people segregated by age ranges, educational attainment, political views, interests, etc. They‚Äôre often not seeing elderly people with any regularity- people who find their adult children their greatest pleasure, or greatest sorrow if they haven‚Äôt had any or have had a falling out. They‚Äôre not seeing moms and dads who are newly empty nesters and love and miss their kids terribly. They‚Äôre just‚Ä¶not exposed to people at different stages of life, and the way that‚Äôs often intermingled with their kids and families. Instead, their lives are very atomized. Most of us in the US have much more atomized lives.  But many people make that atomization a virtue. Their whole lives are very much just about what they as individuals want in any given moment, without a thought to stepping outside the self and just taking in people of the community. And they see children as a hobby almost, like some choose to join a local frisbee league, others have kids! 


I guess I‚Äôm rambling a bit. But I think there is a lack of religious structure that can at the very least, expose people of childbearing age to people of different life stages, to normalize other humans outside of themselves and their particular interests. I think it‚Äôs also common for people in the US who become atheists to explicitly hate religion instead of just being apathetic, and still associating with a broader community or finding joy and meaning in traditions.  I am not sure how that can be changed in the US. 


Anyway, that‚Äôs my somewhat rambling thought as to how come even secular Israelis have more kids and view bigger families more favorably than we do in the US. I think maybe religion does play a role, but not necessarily observance, just the way that religion can strengthen community and connect disparate people to one another. It‚Äôs just a lot less atomized.",2024-05-17T03:10:49+00:00

Thank you for my daily dose of extreme irony. Bonus points for not understanding what ""ad hominem"" means.

You'll often hear Western Islamic apologists claim that Islam 'saved' Greek philosophy and texts during the so-called 'Dark Ages'. There was nothing 'Dark' about the Dark ages. Historians all agree that most Greek texts were well known in the Byzantine Empire (i.e., the Roman empire, which continued until being conquered by the Ottoman's which caused the actual destruction of the knowledge) and also, they were well known in Western Europe. At no point were they in danger of loss. The other one is the transmission of the supposed 'Arab' numerals. Arab numerals are Indian, not Muslim, and the only contribution the Arabs had was making it harder for Indians to sell to the Europeans.

Then again, it can also be really finicky to get the blade out from a Swiss army knife or multitool, especially in stressful situations, making them inconvenient for combat.

And it‚Äôs one of the more reasonable options to allow civilians to have for self-defense, too. Again, if you do have to use it to defend yourself, it‚Äôs less likely to do life-threatening damage, and brandishing it will in many situations be enough to scare away the assailant or give them pause, affording you an opportunity to run away.

Although this document was an attempt to sum up the disagreements that the Boston and Richmond branches had developed with the New York branch, further criticism from Boston MCG of the Richmond contribution to the joint text drew attention to its opposition to ‚ÄòLeft Adventurism‚Äô and concern of drawing upon the anti-maoist politics of the Brigate Rosse.

It was a ""mass meeting hosted by the Struggle Committees Initiative"". The Struggle Committees Initiative has a YouTube channel, in a video of theirs, the men are wearing matching hats. the hats say ""Up Late Up Early"" on the sides, with the acronym for this slogan on the front.

Going back to the woodsmokeblog post, it describes how Maoism lives on after some disbanding...

>While there may be no single Maoist national organization, ¬†there are developing organizations in different parts of the country: the Progressive Youth Organizations in Kansas City \[ StP Kansas City Document \] or St Louis (both founded by Maoists), or the Red Guards in LA and Texas. Although relationships between these groups have seen deterioration with polemical exchanges between Red Guards Austin and Saint Louis Revolutionary Collective.

This is significant for understanding the origins of the OC-MCP.

It also explains why the particular blog which promoted the Sisonite gathering in Chicago in the fall of 2023 also features Islamic rhetoric. There is overlap between the¬†Five-Percent Nation and Maoism.",2024-05-13T17:45:32+00:00

Conservative,comment,l3tzt27,Shadeylark,,"So, to the question of ""how is this crucial to the defense?"" That's not the issue at hand...

The issue at hand is that the state destroyed evidence that had the potential to help the defense.

It is not up to the state to determine what the defense needs to make it's case and any effort at destroying evidence that could potentially aid the defense, regardless of whether the defense chooses to use it or not, harms the ability of the defense to decide on an appropriate defense strategy.

Our entire legal system is predicated upon the idea that the outcome will be determined in a fair and impartial manner... When the prosecution does anything that could hinder the defense beyond making it's case in the courtroom that is the prosecution putting it's finger on the scales and rigging the outcome in its favor.

Both sides are supposed to be playing on an equal playing field; the prosecution rigging the playing field against the defense by destroying evidence the defense could potentially uses undermines the most basic tenets of justice in this country.

The prosecution destroying potentially exculpatory evidence is no different than the defense intimidating a witness.

On the face of things, this seems to me to be an even worse violation of withholding potentially exculpatory evidence.",2024-05-13T10:50:30+00:00

The typical abortion client is an unmarried woman with a low income who already has a child. She needs something that no policy can provide: a loving husband.

The fact is that no social safety net will ever replace a healthy marriage in terms of its benefit to vulnerable women and their children.

Women who are married, barring situations of abuse or other hardship, statistically tend to have healthier babies and pregnancies.

A good marriage helps provide a new mom with emotional, physical, and financial security that she could get almost nowhere else.

Boys grow up to regulate aggression better as adults if they‚Äôve been raised with a father around. Kids of married parents do better professionally, educationally, socially, and even physically. They‚Äôre more likely to escape poverty and stay out of prison.

Marriage has the power to bring security and peace to our mothers ‚Äî and in so doing, to completely transform the lives of our next generation. It has the power to change our whole culture, if we‚Äôd let it. We owe our mothers a culture where marriage is the norm, not the exception ‚Äî a culture where new life is a cause for joy, not for despair.

1) Israel also has nukes, and has made no bones about using the [Samson Option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Option). In other words, Iran had better make DAMN sure Israel has no ability for counterstrike, or else Iran (and much of the ME) is toast.

**EDIT**: I did some checking, and Israel does indeed have nuclear capable subs, so Iran has no chance of preventing a counterstrike.

2) There is a pretty large Arab and Muslim population in Israel. If Iran were to start lobbing nukes, they would risk backlash from the other majority Sunni Muslims worldwide. In effect, they would be committing the very genocide that they are accusing Israel of perpetrating, and against mostly their own people.

3) Saudi Arabia (KSA) had been relying on US support for regional protection. Until the current administration that is. If Iran strikes Israel, it might just drive KSA back into the US's arms (pun intended) which is good for us, bad for Iran, (or) KSA may just go to China, who they've been making overtures with recently (bad for Iran, worse for us).

On the other hand, they've been chanting ""D#&th to Israel"" for decades. For them to finally have nukes and do nothing, may be seen as weakness by their allies.

Conservative,comment,l3sy3fv,Ticonderogue,,"Anti-Semitism has not been caused by Zionism. It's precisely the other way round.

You see the same reaction from the Left immediately following the 1967 six day war in Isreal. Isreal didn't attack it's neighbors, three Muslim nations attacked Israel. Israel won, in a miraculous victory over overwhelming odds, captured and controlled Golan heights (from Syria), west Bank, East Jerusalem (they a territory of Jordan), Gaza strip, and the Sinai peninsula from egypt.

The left's reaction in the US and abroad was that Isreal was the aggressor, and needed to promptly give back all lands it captured from the people... who sought to annihilate the Jews and close the book on Israel's existence for all time but failed disasterously.

The right keeps anticipating Jews come aboard, but they tend to stay on the left for various and complicated reasons, or historical lot have any way. I don't know what reasons they have left now. It's crystal clear that the left is being run by the progressive/ aka socialist wing anymore, and they're anti-semitic anti-zionist.

Conservative,comment,l3qa0dd,SunsetDriftr,,"The biggest difference in conservative vs liberal thinking is logical vs emotional thinking.  

For instance, a liberal will see people are poor and think ‚Äúwell let‚Äôs pay them $20 an hour minimum, and then they will be fine!‚Äù  The conservative will say ‚Äúwell wait a minute, we need to consider how that will impact the larger business‚Äù.

The problem comes into play when a person can ONLY think logically or ONLY think emotionally.  A healthy thinker needs to be open to both forms of thinking. 

I think what frustrates conservatives is too many liberals want to do something or adopt a policy without thinking through the potential consequences.  And if you point those out, the reply is typically ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt care!  Someone has to help these people!‚Äù  But if the liberal wasn‚Äôt so emotional, they could see that their idea will actually HURT the person they want to help.  And if the conservative points that out, they are told they ‚Äòdon‚Äôt care‚Äô about the person.  

The reality is that if politicians had the best interests of voters in mind, they would work together to create policies that are beneficial to society, with both logical and emotional thinking factored into the process.

But of course politicians only care about keeping and amassing power, often at the expense of voters. B",2024-05-12T16:38:27+00:00

American conservatism in theory aims to conserve the political philosophy & principles of the American founding. Namely, liberalism, natural rights, equality, separation of powers, rule of law, social contract theory, republicanism, constitutionalism & federalism.

In practice, progressivism became so dominant & entrenched in our system that conservatism conserves progressive ideals too as if they were natural to our system of government.

Such as legal positivism, judicial deference & restraint, majoritarianism, consolidation of powers and an expanded conception of the role of the president in particular, and the government in general.

So conservatism today isn‚Äôt always a coherent ideology in that it conserves a mix of opposing ideas, the classical liberalism of the American founders and 1900‚Äôs progressivism.",2024-05-12T17:49:32+00:00

However, social conservatism is still mostly alive. For the most part, conservatives are still on the side of family values, morality, rule of law, etc. That is also something I'd like to conserve.

So, if we have two parties that spend the same way but one party at least maintains sane social standards, it's pretty clear to me which is on the right side of history and is actually ""conserving"" at least something valuable, even if there is a lot of ground we've lost over the years.",2024-05-12T18:50:00+00:00

Take the most common argument you hear from leftists, such as how ‚Äúreal communism‚Äù has never been tried: the only obstacle to it is human greed, so all we need to do to make it work is *fundamentally change human nature*. 

Conservatives, correctly, argue that will never happen. We‚Äôre not going to change reality to suit our whims, so instead we view the world through the lens of how we can improve over the past while still taking into account the limitations that we‚Äôre operating with. We see early capitalism and recognize its significant flaws and have refined that system and made it into one of the most potent avenues for personal financial liberty. Is it perfect? Of course not.

You have to remember, these ideas were extremely *radical* in the time period, but the majority of the founders intended to pave the road for these things. You can't legislate hearts and minds, it's a battle that takes time, and the founders knew this. America was the first country to give the right to vote to non land owners, and eventually women, and the first country to make the sale of humans from overseas illegal, and later to completely abolish slavery. To deny these facts is to be uninformed and complicit in furthering division, which has been the Democrat playbook since, well, always. 

I think there's solid evidence that the majority of the founding fathers would have been appalled by the treatment of POCs after the abolition of slavery. They were all pretty much on the same page on the inaliable rights part and understood that freeing the slave class would give them those rights. It was southern Democrats who feared losing their power that fed the racist divide, and don't even bother feeding me the line about the party switch. Republicans of these days suck, but that doesn't mean Democrats are any better. Parties only want to retain power, separate the ideology from the party.

Dare you say liberal?

What you're saying should also apply to today's politics, such as the freedom to marry whoever you want or choosing the medical care you deem necessary for yourself at the moment. 

I never said there wasn't some progressive individuals, but the truth of the matter is there wasn't enough to support freedom for all (only if you were white), freedom to vote (only white male landowners initially in many states). It's also abhorrent that it took 80+ years for non-whites to not be enslaved from birth in the South, and another 100 years to *mostly* eliminate Jim Crow laws.

I'll fully admit I lean left and vote more blue than red now, but I grew up conservative. Perhaps if the Republicans were still moderate, the time before the Tea Party and MAGA, I could still consider myself a moderate Republican, but that ship has sailed. I've watched my parents, formerly moderate Republicans become hateful of anyone who is different from them (not straight and white).

Conservative,comment,l3q5ymo,CentralBankofLogic,,"I saw this group march past yesterday from my building. Makes my blood boil, dude. I was in the Marine Corps. Two combat deployments in Afghanistan. I saw with my own eyes how those people treat other human beings and the rest of the Middle East isn't all that much different. Women have no rights and are treated like cattle. Anyone who isn't like them is a second class citizen. Racism is rampant and in the open. Their culture is fundamentally incompatible with ours. If you want to come here and completely assimilate into the American culture, follow our laws and our way of life, then that's fine. I'll welcome you with open arms. But these people here are invaders plain and simple. I fought for my country. My brothers died for this country. How dare these monsters raise their flag above ours and how dare Chicago *let* them do it. That's not an act of freedom of speech. It's an act of conquest, an insult, a challenge, and they know it. Absolutely disgusting.

Edit: It's one thing to complain about this stuff on Reddit. It's quite another to do something about it. Not that it will move the needle or make a difference, but I ended up filling out a complaint on Chicago's website and leaving a message with City Hall. It was short, polite, and professional (I'm not looking to have my door kicked in), but I stated pretty much everything I wrote in my comment above, that this act will 100% have an impact on my vote and decision to stay in the city long-term, and that it was a clear violation of 4 US Code Section 7, paragraph C regarding proper display of the flag and that it should have been dealt with accordingly as per the law. Again, it's not going to make a difference to these people, and I had already made up my mind regarding my vote and plans of where to live, obviously, but one of the reasons, I believe, this crap keeps happening is because not enough of us are standing up and doing the thing. No one's asking you to take off work and wave a sign, but contact your congressman, email City Hall, go to the school board meetings. Just make your voice heard. Let these people know you exist and that you have a right to a voice. Show this clip to your left-wing family and co-workers and just ask them what they think. Evil prevails when good men do nothing.

Our generosity, kindness, and naivet√© about ""assimilation"" is what got us here in the first place.  Assimilation is a myth. Even as far back as WW2, we liberated a whole bunch of communists because they were being persecuted. We sheltered them and brought them to America. They took full advantage of our kindness and slowly ""assimilated"" into our universities and started plotting the ""end of nationalism"" Including the nationalism of the nation that saved them.  To them we were no different then the ones that persecuted them. Nationalism must be destroyed. No border.  No wall. No USA at all.  It started with our kindness.

1.  Right-leaning(not conservative) media continuing to promote or allude to this story without sharing the entire context; they are pandering to you.  

2.  Poor comprehension skills; you gotta do the whole reading and maybe do some deeper digging. However, in this case, the necessary information is contained in the same damn article that's being referenced, so just some close reading would have done it.  

3.  Examine your own bias;  look, we all know that Joe Biden is a slimy swamp creature, but trying to put all this nefarious dark shit on him is a stretch, and it feels like a counter-narrative to all the well-documented stuff about Trump.

If you're asking me personally in what context I would rationalize it, I think that after Ashley Biden suffered some sort of trauma/ptsd(again, most likely that she was raped/sexually assaulted), she was recording essentially a stream-of-consciousness list of all the things that went into her conception and idea of sex, including a lot stuff that was messed up or weird. Crucially, though, she doesn't say how old she was when this showering took place.  It could be 6 years old.  It could be 25.

The fact that we don‚Äôt have some form of proportional representation by now is a joke, though I think that could change in the near future, especially if labour fail to get a working majority and they need some sort of deal with the Liberal Democrats, which I think might be a possibility. George Galloway claims he‚Äôs standing hundreds of candidates which will chip away at labours vote share especially in constituency‚Äôs with lots of Muslims and/or young people/students and ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù. You also have the fact that high profile left-wing figures like Owen jones have endorsed the greens and other parties, all of which I think could have more of an impact than you would initially think.

I think this election will be an exceptional and interesting one.

Conservative,comment,l3q65et,castor_troy24,,"I lived in PA in 2020 and technically the governor / sec of state broke the law. 

The legislature has to approved any change in procedure in the voting operation. The legislature did not. The mass mail in ballot was a process that was never approved or agreed upon or used until that point. Nor would it have passed because the Republican controlled legislature would not have agreed to that because of distrust. But somehow it was adopted through decree. 
 
Then there was a provision in the process where you were supposed to place the mail in ballot in a privacy envelope that would then go into the addressed envelope. Technically, if you didn‚Äôt adhere to this process, the vote was supposed to be invalid. This was because without the privacy envelope it could be possible for someone to see through the addressed envelope and possibly tamper or be encouraged to commit fraud based on their political leaning. And I remember the democrat executive branch kinda just throwing that out the window when a ton of votes came in without the privacy envelope. To the effect of ‚Äúwe want to make sure every vote counts‚Äù 

Then IIRC, as a registered voter, we got mail prior to the election where it asked, would you like to vote by mail, fill out this form and mail it back (which I did) and then the official ballot was mailed to me - without ever having to prove it was me voting. 

Which makes me wonder right, you have voter rolls that are outdated and not maintained, that‚Äôs been proven - and all these pre-ballots were sent out to maybe tons of places where there were dead voters, people who moved, or even people who were registered but not enthused about voting. It would be have been very easy to skew the result one way or the other. Plus there‚Äôs like sooo many abandoned homes in Philadelphia-  how easy would it have been to take this pre ballots out of mailboxes in abandoned homes and vote on behalf of someone else. It goes both ways though too. How many trailer park moms who are hard right all the way could have filled out their meth addicted sons ballots, who would have never showed up to polling place otherwise, for trump? 

Trump losing PA was curious. PA usually went blue sure, But in 2016 there was like a 50/50 mix of yard signs between Clinton and trump where I lived (Chester county) and trump won PA. In 2020 there like almost no biden signs in yards. There were way less signs all around maybe only 10% of the amount that popped up in 2016. But in my purple county trump signs outnumbered biden probably 3-1. And once you got 50 miles west of Philly, it was all trump signs - no biden signs. Anecdotal for sure. But curious. 

So, do I think it was rigged or stolen, in some ways it felt suspect for sure. I firmly believe if there was no mail in votes and people actually had to show up to a polling place, there‚Äôs no way in hell biden would have won.",2024-05-12T16:13:48+00:00

Frankly, I don't trust this system. The only means of verification I have is that I can check online and see if my ballot was received and accepted. That's not proof that my votes were actually counted. I can look online and see the total votes in each race, but I have to just assume that my vote is one of the 65,000 votes that apparently voted the same way I did, and not one of the 250,000 that didn't. I have no way of knowing if those numbers are accurate at all, or just completely made up. 20 years ago I just assumed that the vast majority of the people working on the election were honest, but these days I see a candidate win by a 2:1 margin when I haven't met a single person who voted for them.

There needs to be a fool proof way to trace my vote from the ballot the to tally board without violating anyone's privacy. To start with, they should release a database of all ballots organized by ballot number. I have my stub, so I can find my ballot by number and check to verify that the votes were counted correctly. If anyone discovers their votes were changed then it would make big news. The only thing I can't figure out is how to ensure there aren't any fake ballots in the database. This is one of the things we allegedly saw in videos from the 2020 election. There were election supervisors pulling stacks of ballots from under the table at 1AM and loading them into the counting machines.

You‚Äôre coming at me hot but I voted for your choice candidate. I‚Äôm not your enemy dawg. And if you think I am, you‚Äôre mistaken. And if you want to talk about why conservatives lose elections, it‚Äôs probably more because the main conservative voter base is so adversarial and buys into the all or nothing, your my enemy or an ally type cast of thinking.  A lot of people agree with conservative viewpoints but don‚Äôt want to be lumped into the confrontational die hard conservative base. And the ‚Äúpower to the people‚Äù messaging the left spews (wether it is true or not - for better or worse) is easier to align with than a trump or desantis, my way or the highway presentation. 

For example. Military Ron looks at everything as a battle he needs to crush his enemies into defeat. But we‚Äôre all Americans. In government you have to govern everyone, not just the voters who elected you. And from my point of view, Biden does the same, denigrating half the voters in the country he leads. And that lack of willingness to cooperate rubs the independents and undecided the wrong way. Is Ron or Don as ban as media portrays, no, but they do themselves no favors in being so set on their beliefs. Donald has actually came around and realized this in some ways, deferring hot point issues like abortion as a local states rights issue rather than national - as it should be.

In the late 1800s a lot of government programs the Republicans had sponsored ended up being far more beneficial to banks and rail road companies than they were for the average citizen. While the intent was to create jobs and aid westward expansion, most Americans were left out of the payout. As more states out west were added, Democrats began to push for aid programs to attract those disgruntled voters. William Jennings Bryan was one of the first well known Democrats who pushed for the bigger government stuff, but at that time the Republicans were still doing much the same thing. By the time Roosevelt was elected on the ""New Deal"" platform, the parties had completely swapped.

The Republicans used to be the guys pushing for a stronger central government over states rights and that absolutely flipped over the course of the 20th century. The last hold outs were people like Strom Thurmond in the South who aligned with the new direction of the Republican party but refused to sign on to ""Lincoln's party"" for a very long time, giving rise to the ""Dixiecrat"" title. Eventually those few ended up swapping parties in the 60s, but most of those were governors and state reps, not federal ones",2024-05-12T04:55:30+00:00

But a starving person has a very large personal incentive to not be starving.  The net societal cost of free food is <0$ because the alternative is theft, and every purchase for security of goods against theft is purchasing power not used for something that's actually productive.   

Free skilled labor training costs around 1000$ per person per week when including overhead.  An order of magnitude difference.  This is not offset by a known alternative cost because unskilled labor exists.  An apprentice eats an enormous amount of time and resources from a journeyman or teacher while training.  The net benefit can be very great after 10 years but the immediate cost is very high which makes it hard to convince voters to fund programs for them.  Student loans exist, but are you suggesting broader reaching student subsidies?

Then note others point out it‚Äôs not.  There‚Äôs a non-alcoholic drug being administered.

What will likely end up happening is a guy with cases of booze will go to homeless camps and say ‚Äúwe got any alcoholics here that want a drink?‚Äù and give away booze to anyone that wants it.  Whole camp will get hammered and then we will have drunk and desperate people loose on the streets.

I wanted to like Haley. I did like her for a time. But then she spoke at length about her policy ideas. Come to think of it, I don't recall all that she said that threw me off. Real neo-con vibes tho. One topic I remember was her insistence that people register their names to be on social media, so that they would self moderate what they had to say, knowing the public could know who who was saying what, as if doxing and cancel culture doesn't exist. I like my anonymity on social.

- supporting hormone blockers that permanently alter a childs growth, present health complications for life, and increase the chances of suicide for that persons entire life.
- mutilating the bodies of perfectly healthy children in the name of being ""woke"". 
- equality of outcome. 
- open borders. The left thinks borders are racist. Just wild.
- voter ID is racist. (This is a racist and thus radical viewpoint to hold) 
- ""colonizers"" = anyone born in the country that is white. If you're any other race, even if you're a fresh immigrant, you're not a colonizer. (The colonizers died a few hundred years ago, but I guess liberals haven't clued in yet.) 
- ""take the vaccine or you're a murderer"" - *fast forward to today* - ""the vaccine has been pulled for being dangerous"". They STILL support the vaccine. RADICAL. 
- the left supports Hamas. (P.s., i hate Isreal too. That's a war fought between two shithole cultures/ peoples). Anyone taking a side is a dickhead imo. 
- Trump derangement syndrome. People hate him but most can't even state why. (That isn't to say there aren't valid concerns to have about him, but he's not the devil as the left would have you believe) 
-  Stupid shit like UBI (precursor to communism) 
- many leftist radicals LITERALLY support communism, which is disgraceful. Imo, they may as well be supporting Nazism. Both are deadly ideologies. 

Every single viewpoint of the left is so offensively radical, it blows my mind that there are seemingly intelligent people supporting them. 

I considered myself liberal my whole life, then I grew up. Now I am disgusted by anyone supporting the left. I don't even think most people ""on the right"" are even traditionally right, I think most people are center, center left or center right, but anything to the left of these far left ideologues is considered radical to them.

This is what they have been saying since election day. There were multiple issues reported almost immediately after they happened all over the country. Most of those problems were not denied, but swept under the rug because it ""wasn't enough to alter election results"" or was not evidence of ""wide-spread fraud"".

People also tend to ignore that most of these issues/incidents were never properly investigated. 

These statements were made at hearings seeking permission to look for additional evidence. . .yet told that they couldn't look for evidence, because they had no evidence.

You know, in the end the media could be 100% right, that there was no ""wide-spread"" fraud or conspiracy, and that even the problems that have since been confirmed did not significantly affect the election. . .but it is just bizarre how it was handled, and leaves many with very little trust/faith in our elections.",2024-05-11T15:55:46+00:00

Conservative,comment,l3kpivg,Spinner4,,"I see democrats point to the CARES act as the cause of inflation but yet they ignore the ARPA funding and extensions of the CARES act that came under Biden. The ARPA cost way more money. Also, Biden‚Äôs had time to react to the market from his act, Trump never got that chance. We don‚Äôt know if Trump would have raised taxes (more likely Tariffs) to offset the inflation.

But the hike in gas had nothing to do with Covid, CARES, or ARPA. It was the reaction to Biden‚Äôs day 1 in office and decommitment to US oil. This had a major impact to the economy as it became more expensive to transport goods. And so this is where prices increased for food. 

So Oil, Covid, Cares, Arap, aiding war ,and many others played a major factor in inflation, and not all were caused by Joe. But where Joe has completely failed is his reaction to it. And this isn‚Äôt just the case for inflation, we can look at many major issues and say where was Joe and his team. Why hasn‚Äôt he gone to Russia to try to talk peace or Israel? Sleeping Joe has been completely a sleep at the wheel. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault, or I didn‚Äôt do that‚Äù is not a response from a President. Everything is now your responsibility regardless if your admins actions were the cause of the problem.

Conservative,comment,l3h5mkn,MiltonRoad17,,"One of the main reasons that the birth rate is declining is because monogamy, the nuclear family, and marriage are all under attack.

* In 1970, there were almost 86 married people for every 1000 unmarried citizens. Now, [that number is not even 35.](https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-us-marriage-rate-rebounds-to-its-pre-pandemic-level)  

* In 1970, almost 70% of Americans between 25 and 49 years old lived with a spouse and at least one child under 18. [That has now dropped to 37%.](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/09/14/the-modern-american-family/)

* More than double the amount of [Generation Z citizens](https://medium.com/hello-love/love-in-gen-z-world-c1652be300c4) have been in a polyamarous relationship compared to Millennials or Gen X'rs.

* Only [55% of the US adult population](https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/45271-how-many-americans-prefer-nonmonogamy-relationship) consider themselves to be completely monogamous.

* [23% of the children](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/12/12/u-s-children-more-likely-than-children-in-other-countries-to-live-with-just-one-parent/) in the United States are raised by a single parent. That is the highest rate in the entire world.

No one can tell me that these statistics aren't alarming. The nuclear, monogamous family is the best foundation for a stable, prolific society. When that goes, the society goes. 

If we want to increase our birth rate, we need to find ways to increase marriages and have Americans get back into monogamous relationships again.",2024-05-10T19:36:55+00:00

General counsel for the secretary of state‚Äôs office Charlene McGowan confirmed that Fulton County broke the law in their recount.

Failure to back up recount data was acknowledged by Fulton in January 2021.

>State officials reported that there were 3,075 duplicate ballot images, but they were unable to determine how many of the ones cast were tabulated in the recount.

At the moment there is no evidence that any ballots were double counted. It sounds like ballot images in backup systems were duplicated somehow. Still a major screw up, but again, no evidence so far that this has in any way impacted the recount

>The complaint also says that the county is missing more than 17,000 ballot images that were requested for inspection from the 2020 election.

No idea where there 380k number comes from, that would be like every vote cast in the entire county. Again, 17k missing is still a concerning screw up, but not exactly the major evidence of election interference that Vladimir over on X would seem to want you to believe.

If you watch the video you see somebody asking ""why were there 380k ballot images missing?"". They're not bringing any documentation showing that there were 380k ballots missing, they're just asking a question. The answer is basically, we have not heard that allegation before, we don't know if that's even true because we were only investigating the ballot images from the recount and not the ones from election day. Which is reasonable. That doesn't mean the allegation is false, but there is no evidence linked in this thread which indicates it's true either. For all we know it's a ""have you stopped beating your wife?"" question.

The headline sounds like a massive bombshell and then the actual video shows jack shit.

And assuming that the county did in fact lose those ballot images, that is still a far cry from what has been ""claimed, without evidence"" by Donald Trump, which is not merely that processes were mishandled but that he straight-up won and it was stolen from him. The ballot images are a record-keeping footnote, a backup of a backup, because the ultimate system of record is the *paper* ballots which were already recounted once by hand and once by machine.",2024-05-11T02:25:06+00:00

The idea that the Democrats could secretly inject hundreds of thousands of votes, bribe or threaten hundreds of state and federal republicans into compliance, and do this all without leaving evidence behind is just an absurd proposition. Especially when we consider that Trump has routinely alleged fraud or cheating in any kind of race he has ever been in. In 2016, he claimed that millions of illegal immigrants were voting for Hillary Clinton. Yet, after winning the election and Republicans taking the House and the Senate, they did nothing to reform or secure elections.",2024-05-13T05:50:42+00:00

Therefore, the voters had to file the claim, not Trump or the GOP. They didn't dispute, or even hear the evidence.

Conservative,comment,l3vq4bv,day25,,"No you are the one that has to ignore the evidence here. Why would I ignore King v Witmer? It proves what I said correct why would you think that helps you at all?

It's extremely corrupt for a court to dismiss on standing grounds and then make comments about the evidence that they never heard in their court. So your case is actually a great example of the corruption here. The comment you cited is a joke: ""nothing but speculation and conjecture that votes for President Trump were destroyed, discarded or switched to votes for Biden"". There is 100% proof that happened now, and at the time there were sworn affidavits made under penalty of perjury by witnesses who were never to this day charged for lying to the courts (despite the obvious willingness to go after anyone who sided with Trump in 2020). How can a judge who dismissed a case based on standing, interviewed and cross examined no witnesses, allowed no discovery, etc. just blindly assert that it's nothing but ""speculation and conjecture""? That's extremely inappropriate and should have resulted in disbarment in any non-corrupt legal system. Sworn affidavits are to be assumed credible and accurate when deciding whether to dismiss a case on standing your example just proves the judge didn't do that and violated basic law.

The fact the appeals courts also left it untouched is irrelevant. My argument was that the courts are hopelessly corrupt just as they've been on many other issues throughout history. Your argument is nothing but an argument from authority. You tried to claim the courts looked at the evidence but that's a flat out lie and you know it. Nevermind that these cases you cited are not Trump's cases (again - he only had two flagship cases they were his SCOTUS case and his Georgia case, he was illegally denied a hearing on the merits in both). This is ""King"" - you are trying to link something to Trump that wasn't even his case.

Hundreds of sworn affidavits in these lawsuits you can't point to a court that put them on the stand, allowed discovery to look into their claims, etc. and then exposed their claims as false. That didn't happen as much as you need to lie and pretend that it did.

> they couldn't even craft an argument that had standing. 

Right. Before the election he has no standing because the election hasn't happened yet and hasn't suffered any damages. After the election he has no standing because laches he should've filed before the election. No matter what courts can always make up a reason to dismiss a case based on standing if they want. But all you need to do is read the actual reasons they used to see that it's corrupt and fake.

If you actually thought Trump had no evidence you would have wanted to address it in court to make him look like a fool. Imagine Trump's lawyers and witnesses being exposed as liars on TV why wouldn't you want that? Because you know that's not what would happen. You know that any debate on the evidence and on the facts will work in his favor not against him that's why his opponents needed to do everything possible to prevent it.

You don't get to have your cake and eat it too. You can't run from the evidence, disallow it on social media, refuse to cover it in the news, dismiss cases without any discovery or any trial on the merits and then claim you addressed it because some corrupt anti-Trump judge made some snarky comment.

Biden has to go, no denying that, and we need all the help we can get... But...

Voting just to get rid of one evil doesn't guarantee a worse evil won't take his place.  That's the worry libertarians have... And I gotta say it is a valid worry (particularly given what we've seen from the uniparty for the past forty years)

We need to vote for candidates, not just against candidates... Or else we will be doing exactly what the left did in 2020.

And following up on that... I don't see any difference between a swamp monster with a (D) beside their name and a swamp monster with an (R) beside their name... Either one is a member of the uniparty and neither one is any more interested in helping regular people than the other.

So, even if we get rid of Biden, unless we get the right people in places of authority, none of it will matter.

So again, I lean towards the libertarians on this in that just getting rid of the wrong people is not enough... We need to get the right people in to replace them as well.

That all said....I fully believe Trump to be the right guy.  We need to work to convince the libertarians Trump is the right guy, not just try to convince them that Biden needs to go.

As with anything, before you can try to persuade someone you need to make sure you're both speaking the same language...

So that's why Libertarianism turns to cuckoldry. The other end is Fascism, where the greatest decisions are made from the stand point of what's the best way to maximize liberty and happiness for society, at the expense of the individual - if you believe in absolute maximizing of liberty, which is what libertarianism claims they do believe to support, then you have to ultimately support Fascist actions to get to that end state.

If you actually care about things changing for the better, you have to acknowledge mistakes that were made, and the pandemic spending was a huge mistake. you can [take a look for yourself](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FDHBFRBN) at the federal reserve holdings of US debt in Trumps last year. It almost doubles, jumping by \~$2.2T thanks to the [CARES act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARES_Act) signed by president trump to pay for the lockdowns that he vocally supported even if he didn't mandate.

I know the left will deny the facts, and outright lie about things they've done, but if the right does it too, there's literally no chance of turning this ship around. Trump dropped the ball during the pandemic. His administration and all the government agencies were working against him to be sure, but the buck stops with him. And unfortunately the bucks didn't stop to the tune of $2.2T.

This is in no way a suggestion to not vote for Trump as the Biden administration has been worse by every measure. But this country will go bankrupt if the right doesn't rein in spending because the left certainly won't.",2024-05-10T15:39:12+00:00

This would stop any and all new legislation which is just fine by me. Committees can continue work, but even if they can't, so what? Biden DOJ won't prosecute itself or turn over relevant documents anyway.

Mike Johnson may be a good man. I believe he is. But we've had very few opportunities to use leverage over the past few years and he blew a major one. We need someone with the stones use whatever leverage is available.

In case anyone hasn't noticed we're to the point where political dissidents are being rounded up and jailed.  J6 arrests are accelerating this year. They are going after people for offenses that are more and more trivial every day.

EVERY single opportunity to use leverage to our advantage must be taken. If we don't have the votes or the executive branch for the legislation and action we want but we do have the numbers to stop harmful legislation and harmful action then that's what Republicans need to do even if it means a government shutdown.

At this point a functioning government is actively doing more harm than good. See Biden flying in immigrants. See DOJ rounding up political dissidents. See DOJ actively attempting to manipulate the 2024 election via prosecutions and censorship. See National Security attempts to manipulate the 2020 election by suppressing and discrediting the Hunter Biden laptop.

And Mike Johnson is worried about the optics of voting down a border security bill when the administration is already using border funds to bring in as many migrants as they can? Sorry, he's not the man for the job. Go back and look at the reaction to him on MSNBC. He was celebrated. He handed them a win he didn't have to.

It's not like judges arbitrarily decided to help Trump in his election so they decided to delay the trial. You can look it at every single case and there's some shenanigans from the prosecutors' side.

They keep wondering why the trials get delayed - he's a former President and he has good lawyers - but not for the same reasons they think.

He's a former President not in the sense that he's getting ""better treatment"" because he knows the system, him and and his lawyers know the bureaucracy. They are law clerks, prosecutors and defense attorneys who have worked with the likes of Jack Smiths and Fanis of the world. This is why SCOTUS taking the immunity case was so shocking for the libs but for me, it was obvious. 

I didn't know that Ashley Merchant, McAfee and Fani Willis used to work together - you see Trump's lawyers know this in GA, and they know how corrupt Fani is. Steve Saddow knows Fani and her paper trail.

Same thing in Jack Smith - this is not a bright individual, he's a maniac who rushes things and later gets overturned on appeal with his reckless motives. He is the reason why Bob McDonnell's career got ruined.

His lawyers also understand constitutional arguments - a regular John Doe wouldn't get these lawyers.

It's ludicrous to pretend that things like the carbon tax and mass immigration don't have significant and serious economic consequences for example. I guess mass immigration allows Canada to fake GDP growth but that falls flat when you look at per capita and also since all those immigrants need places to live it drives the cost of housing through the roof.

If you are successful it means you are an oppressor - who are we to say that one behavior is better than another? If there are no better behaviours and there's only power and privilege, then those who are successful must be successful because they've oppressed others who aren't successful. It's a mindset where you punish success and reward failure. Where you have to feel guilty if you are successful, where you have to make yourself into a victim in order to be good and virtuous.

Conservative,comment,l3e9fsb,EreshkigalKish2,,"former liberal, I have observed that many within the left-leaning political spectrum often portray themselves as champions of the marginalized, committed to fighting for those they perceive as oppressed. However  advocacy appears to be selectively applied, particularly when it comes to religious persecution. While issues like Palestinian rights are prominently advocated for  plight of Christians‚Äîwho are among the most persecuted religious groups in middle east are christians who are second-class in Islamic lands harassed persecuted because of their religion and ethnicity  Christians face severe oppression from both state and non-state actors, yet their suffering does not seem to garner the same level of attention or outrage.

Moreover, the situation of the Assyrians, an indigenous group to the Middle East with a rich cultural heritage, also demonstrates this inconsistency. Despite recent severe persecution, including ISIS-led ethnic cleansing and the establishment of slavery markets in Mosul less than a decade ago, the global response‚Äîespecially from those on the lefthas been tepid compared to their reactions to other crises. This lack of attention is puzzling and suggests a potential underlying bias within left-leaning circles against Christians and perhaps even Jews.

This selective advocacy raises important questions about the principles that guide leftist support. Why is there such a disparity in the response to similar issues of persecution and oppression? This pattern of selective concern leads to the perception of an inherent bias on the left, which is both anti-Christian and anti-Jewish  It is crucial for those who advocate for human rights to examine their biases and strive for consistency in their advocacy, ensuring that all groups facing persecution receive the attention and support they desperately need",2024-05-10T06:12:04+00:00

Vivek has also essentially agreed to all of the points that you mentioned he has publicly stated faith in the god. Now he has not mentioned if he means parambramha like in advaita Hinduism or YHWH like Christians but the words in the country is in GOD we trust which actually doesn't mention which one. Now here is another clincher Hinduism is a hugely multifaceted philosophy to the point that an atheist can be Hindu and so can a Christian.

If you believe this is policy related, then it's on Trump because the effect of fiscal and monetary policy on inflation has a significant lag time.  Further, Jerome Powell who was Trump's federal reserve appointee was at the helm all through covid, and still is.

The reality is something you are going to downvote me to hell for, but the first authorization of the vaccine was in Dec 2020.  The rollout didn't really get going until early 2021.  The cause of inflation was a combination of supply chains being screwed from covid causing low supply, and demand spiking hard as people got their vaccinations.

We spent money, as a one time effor to offset the immediate shock of a policy of lockdowns. It was a DIRECT effort to prevent a collapse of the economy. 

Biden, OTOH, looked at an already recovering situation and said ""If we can afford to prevent a total collapse of the economy, we can afford expenditures to pay for progressive policies unrelated to how well or poor the economy is doing.""

Its asinine.

Conservative,comment,l3balxe,cazort2,,"The spin on this piece is aggravating. The concern here is over unnecessary killing of civilians and aid workers, and leveling of civilian infrastructure, and it's being spun as ""selling out a stalwart U.S. ally to save a terrorist organization"". No one here loves Hamas, the issue is Israel's indiscriminate killing of civilians and aid workers.

Not far back a US citizen was killed with WCK, even after them meticulously coordinating with the IDF. The IDF has one of the best-funded and most technologically-advanced militaries in the world, and they cannot avoid these types of killings? I find it completely unbelievable. There is piece after piece coming out, just recently BBC ran a piece about a sniper shooting a young boy in the back when there were no combatants or threats anywhere in sight.

At a bare minimum the IDF is dysfunctional and isn't even trying to avoid collateral damage. But the reality may be far worse. If you look at what Israeli politicians are talking about, and how they have been talking for months now, a good portion of the people in Netanyahu's government (look at Belazel Smotrich, who incidentally supported Hamas for years) are openly using dehumanizing language to describe the Palestinians, and openly calling for the destruction of all civilian infrastructure, and I take that as evidence that the civilian casualties are the result of intentional policies.

Spinning criticism of this reality as ""antisemitism"" is intellectually dishonest.

The fact that so many people in Netanyahu's government openly supported Hamas for years makes my head spin. How is criticizing this government ""antisemitic""?",2024-05-09T17:55:24+00:00

Conservative,comment,l3c8a7m,cazort2,,"I think it strengthens our interests for us to stay out of the region. The US supplying Israel has put us at odds with groups that would otherwise probably leave us alone (i.e. Houthis) which creates indirect costs not just to us, but to business (i.e. as international shipping routes get threatened) and on top of that it's many billions of spending that we could instead be using to cut taxes and/or pay down the debt.

I think our unquestioning support of Israel also leads them to act with impunity. Part of why they are being so sloppy and doing whatever they want is that they have the US stamp of approval. If they had to fend for themselves, they'd be fine, but they'd be forced to be a good bit more restrained. They have been pushing a lot of boundaries, like the attack on the Iranian embassy, killing journalists even on other countries' soil.

> it just weakens the western nations withholding aid.

I disagree with this. I think Western nations are better off when they stay out of controversial conflicts. And to clarify, I'm not talking about Ukraine, there's little controversy there, Russia was the clear aggressor and it makes sense for the West to want to provides support to prevent unfettered aggression. The situation in Israel and Palestine is messier because there isn't a clear aggressor; even though the recent fighting was set off by the Oct. 7th attacks, the conflict itself goes back much longer, and the scale of the conflict has been escalated by Israel to the point that the number of civilian casualties on the Palestinian side is now much larger than the number of Israelis killed in the initial attacks. Even if you agree with Israel's actions (which I don't) it's hard to deny: it's ugly.

It's the sort of conflict I would want us to stay out of, and I think it weakens any country to provide aid to Israel because it turns a huge portion of the Middle East against us. If you look at how most other countries respond to the Israel/Palestine conflict vs. the Russia/Ukraine conflict, you can see this; the sentiment is pretty opposite, with respect to US aid in the two conflicts, with only a few exceptions (like India being all buddy-buddy with Russia, along with a few other countries that don't matter as much, thankfully China has mostly stayed out of it.) Supporting Ukraine helps our international reputation and helps global stability, whereas supporting Israel has the opposite effect.",2024-05-09T21:07:19+00:00

It's like the whole ""once they graduate college and have to start paying taxes they'll grow up"" mentality... no... no they won't; the mess we're in now is precisely because they didn't grow up.  They won't ""grow up"" until we on the right do something to help them grow up.

Wanting more fiscal responsibility is fine... but until we win the culture war and get people who agree with us in positions of power in the first place its all just Canute screaming at the tide.

We need to change places like Hollywood before we can change places like Congress... but too many establishment republicans will look at a cultural vacuum in places like Hollywood, and instead of stepping in will instead shrug their shoulders and say ""oh, that's good... anyways, about that budget?"" and in another generation will still be wondering why they are losing the culture war so badly and can't get their people elected as a result.",2024-05-10T15:01:00+00:00

Ignoring the original movie, it looks like another bland disaster-horror movie with little chemistry between the actors, and that's just in the trailer. The *only* thing this movie has going for it is Glen Powell, but I have a strong suspicion there's gonna be some two dimensional girlboss mary sue that one ups him absurdly in every scene.

When you consider the original film, it is a legitimately bad idea to try and make a sequel. The original movie has so many things going for it that were by all accounts chance. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton's chemistry, for example, was not a result of careful casting, but because Tom Hanks dropped out at the last minute and recommended Paxton to replace him. It's one of the very last action blockbusters that was filmed using mostly practical SFX, so it **will** highlight and draw complaints about how over reliant modern productions have become on green screens and CGI. This movie also came at the peak of the 'everyman action hero' era kicked off by Die Hard that has largely died off thanks to Woke Hollywood's hatred of normal people, especially men. Everyone in Twister is very relatable for the audience, we all know people like those on screen. Everyone's got a friend like Dusty, knows a dysfunctional couple like Bill and Jo Harding, a neighbor or family member like Aunt Meg. I'll bet you my left testicle there's several liberal alphabet characters, a number of characters that are warped and exaggerated stereotypes about middle America, and not a single believable salt of the earth American in Twisters.

As an aside, my favorite part about the original Twister is it shows the very best examples of our character as a nation. Nearly every character in that movie is a Ph.D. or a Ph.D. candidate, but its from a time when that meant you did actual hard work to study a hard science. You got in the field, got your hands dirty, pushed a little further to know a bit more. They do it to help the public, not for their own glory. And the character that is a glory hound is literally the villain of the film. It's an almost polar opposite to how academics are today.",2024-05-10T05:27:08+00:00

It's also similar to the concept of hiroshima apologism. Maybe not all people there deserved it, but the death and the horror the japanese empire put upon that part of the world (or was forecasted to continue doing) made it an incredibly clear choice.

Conservative,comment,l3ez7iw,berkarov,,"Not really. Given money and value is all abstract, the numbers at any given time don't matter, as much as the relationship between them does; eg, how far your money goes. People still need to buy stuff, cause they can't eat their money, and they still need day to day stuff. The 'concern' is that if money increases in value over time, people are less likely to invest it, therefore creating a smaller pool of capital, which therefore slows overall economic growth. While potentially true, this also has 1) a moderating effect on economic growth, 2) encourages greater stability by not relying on total financial leveraging to operate a business, 3) increases reward for those that are contributing to the pool of investment capital (higher demand for capital investments), 4) doesn't punish people who would rather save their money than risk it by investing it. The quiet part not spoken by inflation advocates and deflation fear mongers is that they would prefer you be incentivized to invest (and risk losing your money) in order to not lose the value of your earnings, in order to make access to capital for themselves easier and cheaper. Furthermore, a deflating currency tends to be indicative of a non-fiat currency; without fiat currency, or incurring the massive negatives to debasing a non-fiat currency, government has significantly less money to spend. This essentially means that inflation advocates are advocating for a state where the people in government have the ability to spend as much as they want, to their own benefit, and with little consequence.",2024-05-10T11:17:23+00:00

in all seriousness, the money supply is best left unbothered. neither increasing or decreasing in supply. stop changing the money supply today would be a good option, although the government paying down its debt would be good too.

furthermore, consumption is not what leads to economic growth. Production is. To the extent that there is less consumption it means more resources are available for capital investment and innovation which is the true driver of economic growth. a fixed supply of money which naturally increases in value would not only lead to a more productive economy, but one where the supply and demand for goods and services across time align more closely.",2024-05-10T14:48:08+00:00

Conservative,comment,l3etuwg,nar_tapio_00,,"I'll make it for Ukraine. There's often a question ""how do I know where my money goes?"", ""are they really honestly using it?"". First the value.

**Iraq War** - $1 trillion in 2001- 50k Iraqis and 3000 tanks destroyed.

**Afghan war** - $2 trillion (maybe $3 trillion depending how you count - what's a trillion between friends?) 50k goat herders and a negligible amount of hardware destroyed. Plenty of hardware donated to the Afghan army and then taken by the Taliban when they ran away or crossed over. 

**Ukraine.** About $0.1 trillion spent including the latest bill - 500k Russian murderers, 15,000 Armored vehicles, 1 attack submarine (!!) 1/2 the Baltic fleet and tens of Russian oil refineries destroyed, many air defense systems and lots of artillery.

Russia is producing those tanks and armored vehicles for a reason. They have already said the want to take Alaska and most of Europe and their support of a Chinese attack on the Pacific soon is almost certain. They will need to be destroyed some time or other. Doing it now, in Ukraine where the only American lives being lost are brave volunteers who specifically went there to fight for freedom of their own accord is the best value America is ever going to get. 

Plus, there are plenty of counties in Europe that are putting in more of their GDP than the US. Some, like Norway, are even putting in more money per person. That means that the American spending goes much further here than it would do elsewhere. Yes, Hungary and Slovakia are a problem. 

You can check the numbers from here:

https://github.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine?tab=readme-ov-file

Conservative,comment,l3euwfo,RaoulDukeRU,,"I once saw a documentary, here in Germany, about a VA hospital. This must've been around 2005. 

**I WAS SHOCKED!!**

The hospital was in a disgusting state beyond imagination. There was one room at the end of the floor, where you had patients with bandages that have not been changed, patients ""untreated"" waiting for transportation to another place. You had vermin like cockroaches crawling around. Demented old men, sitting in their own feces etc. It was a room of horror!

And I was born and raised in Heidelberg. The former headquarters of the US Army in Europe. There was a small hospital (at the Nachrichten Kaserne) where I was waiting for one of our American friends, when she had to went to the OB-GYN. It was a super cool office! You had a TV running in the waiting room, where I was watching ""Hunted Mansion with Eddy Murphy (so I didn't wanted to leave when she was finished) and everything was clean and modern. So I thought that every US military military hospital was like ""ours"".

So I was even more shocked when watching this documentary!

Americans are always so proud about their troops and thank every little military member for their service. So I could barely believe what I saw! The Veterans got ""patched together"" at Landshut Hospital really good, which is one of the best hospitals in the world and responsible why the number of fatal causalities was so _""low"",_ in comparison to the soldiers that got wounded, just to end up in such a hellhole somewhere back in the States!",2024-05-10T10:35:03+00:00

I've following up on his investments and......guess what I found...

IT seems that the meta investment was not singular and McCaul HAS BEEN INSIDE TRADING ON EVERY BILL AND ACT HE WROTE!

His recent most notable investment involved the purchase of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSM:US) before its +25.29% price increase on January 16, 2024. 

You should probably know TSMC has been imported into Arizona under the so-called CHIPSforAmerica Act, which, by the way, was also introduced by McCaul and he pushed it with great enthusiam.

Then in March the government announced that they'd been working on a $5 billion grant to the CHIP plant which later brought a major stock price increase.

McCaul seized the opportunity and sold approximately 2k shares he bought earlier and earned more than 300K!!! What a coincidence Mike.

The grant was officially directed to the company in April 8th and on that same day, he hailed himself on X,""My #CHIPSforAmericaAct is working to bring multi-billion-dollar investments to the US‚Äîjust as intended."" 

Investments to US? More like... to Mike himself?

The DNC handed the nomination in 2020 to Biden although they knew he was old and uninspiring because they thought he was the only candidate who could defeat Trump. And considering how close the EC ended up being, they might have been right. 

Fine. But they also picked his VP, and thus his heir apparent, based on intersectionality points rather than merit. So now, they're stuck with an incumbent who's falling apart in real time, for the whole nation to see, but they also couldn't really have him step down and let his VP run in his stead because Kamala is an atrocious politician  and wouldn't do any better. And thanks to the obsession with identity politics that they've fostered for the past 15 years, they also couldn't replace her in favor of a better alternative.

So now they're trapped on the Biden train which is derailing more and more and on track to lose a very winnable election. Even with all the shit that's going on, Trump is still a deeply flawed candidate with a very hard and very low ceiling. I have no doubt that e.g. Obama, or really any skilled campaigner and advocate for his own cause, would be able to win this election if put in Biden's position.",2024-05-09T14:45:32+00:00

Conservative,comment,l3djl5o,Ticonderogue,,"Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and National Public Radio (NPR) as set up by an act of Congress in 1967, ought to prove that it is non partisan. Being that it received funding from the government, if Congress have questions regarding whether it's balanced or acting as a coast to coast broadcast of liberal taking points, should they should make themselves available for inquiries.

CPB's nonprofit corporate outline states, ""Created programs that are controversial should be objective and present a balance of opinions. Likewise, the corporation cannot support any political candidate nor any political party.""

As to NPR being federal funded, they state that they only receive direct federal funding of 2% (of its budget). NPR is however funded by affiliate stations (there are about 1000), who pay fees. Affiliate stations also receive direct government grants, which are then paid to NPR. So we can conclude that more than the stated 2% of NPR funding is given them... Indirectly by federal government, thru affiliate stations.

Whenever NPR is rated, they come out leaning Democrat/Liberal every time. Their listenership is 56% Democrat, about 17% Republican, the rest being independent or non-affiliated. Despite the political skew of its listeners, NPR maintains that its not politically biased. Whenever I've listened to NPR, which I still do occasionally (I like to hear both sides)... and NPR reliably offers just liberal viewpoints! The public polled say they trust NPR as unbiased as CNN, NBC, ABC (51%). Naturally, 51% trusted doesn't sound goo enough (what with half this country being Democrats), and I don't think CNN is unbiased or balanced.",2024-05-10T02:21:42+00:00

Christians know that satans comes to rape, murder and steal. Its only natural a religion that doesnt have the God of the bible, would resort to the same things it speaks about when it comes to satan. The thing is, Jesus even exists in the quaran. 

Hamas themselves, while idk how true this is due to the source, came out with a statement about how they launched the attack in response to the red heifer prophecy within the bible. Israel has been trying to restore the temple on the mount where they have their dome of the rock thing. Obviously, a religion as violent as islam rather than talk or sort things out diplomatically, they resort to killing and raping people. I know everyone isnt religious but the bible speaks of all the events that are happening rn. It also will become worse for israel. I believe if they continue their assualt on hamas, which they will and they should, more nations are gonna start looking at them negatively.

Think about how many muslims exist around the world. They are the second biggest religion behind Christianity. While all Christians dont stand together, all muslims do.

The admission is confirmed by AstraZeneca in legal documents responding to a group action claim launched by Leigh Day partner Sarah Moore under section 2 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 against the pharmaceutical giant, AstraZeneca. It is expected that the claims could be worth millions of pounds.

Fifty-one claimants represented by Sarah are pursuing the claim due to injuries allegedly caused by the Vaxzevria Astra Zeneca COVID-19 Vaccine manufactured by AstraZeneca UK Limited (AZUK). Twelve of the claimants are acting on the behalf of a loved one who died following a complication allegedly caused by the vaccine.

All twelve of the bereaved claimants have received death certificates or medical evidence that confirms that the AZUK vaccine caused the deaths and injuries suffered by their loved ones.

Most exceptional people are driven today by money. Not all, but most. A secondary factor might be prestige.

1) a low salary in comparison to other professional fields.
2) disrespectful, and sometimes outright violent students
3) parents who refuse to take responsibility for their children‚Äôs behavior and often blame the teachers.
4) administrators who refuse to support their teachers and disciplines students
5) ideologues during their college years and teaching years, forcing radical concepts that they intern are forced to shove down their own students throats
6) additional work and expenses outside of classroom hours such as grading and buying classroom supplies

As a result, this career becomes attractive to the less exceptional and the ideological. Only the most passionate of people willing to disregard money and status will pursue this beyond that.

The solution is to address these issues. a more drastic solution could be to look at our own culture and return to a time where teaching was an acceptable secondary source of income, not taken by the primary breadwinner.",2024-05-09T11:02:59+00:00

Speak for yourself: I registered Republican for the first time this year (voted Obama in 2008/2012, different third parties in 2016/2020) because of all this ""lawfare"" nonsense. This is a purposeful distraction by the liberal elites and the liberal media. Clear as daylight. Trump's record speaks for itself and liberals had PLENTY of time to prosecute this stuff, before Trump was president AND during his first term. The timing here is purposely trying to distract from the fact that Biden is a complete and total failure, along with his party. Even Obama and Hillary seem to be jumping ship, it's rats as far as the eye can see. 

So don't claim this hurts Trump with moderates...no it hurts him with Oligarchs. That's who we're fighting against, as ""everyday Americans"". The corporate class, the people who have their money and want to keep it coming, while the rest of us are paying 30-50% more for EVERYTHING (vs 2019).

When Will Smith can slap Chris rock on stage in front of millions and it's Jada who is the villain... You think Stormy Daniels testimony is gonna hurt Trump?

None of this is hurting Trump.  At most it's a neutral exchange; Trump was the billionaire playboy who had an affair with a money-hungry sl-t who was out for herself... Or it was Trump was a victim being used by a manipulative money-hungry who-e who used her tits and ass to get what she wanted without a care about the consequences.

Yeah... This isn't hurting Trump at all.

Yeah... This is why conservatives, particularly the ""old guard true conservatives"" who abandoned Trump because of his moral character are perpetual losers... They are entirely disconnected from the actual cultural zeitgeist.

People who are stuck in 1989 pretending like the country is the same as it was when the Soviet Union still existed have little business in modern politics and culture, and even less credibility when they talk about said subjects.

Edit: you can downvote and get upset at this all you want... But your moral outrage at the degeneracy of our modern culture has as little bearing on the reality of the situation as does the moral outrage of a leftist who wants you to accept him as a non-binary cat xe/xim.

Yet, it's a thing because money was exchanged. You can bury your head in the sand as long as you want; but the reality is that Trump has good enough lawyers that he does not pay for things he didn't do.

---


‚ÄúI do not say that democracy has been more pernicious on the whole, and in the long run, than monarchy or aristocracy. 

Democracy has never been and never can be so durable as aristocracy or monarchy; but while it lasts, it is more bloody than either. Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. 

There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. 

It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. 

When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. 

Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.‚Äù",2024-05-09T02:22:25+00:00

That was the subject, not the current Democrat president.

Try to keep up.

If you want fondle John McCain's corpse or suck off Mitch McConnel until he's all the way in the casket, that's on you.

If you have more value in The Republican Party unity, and consider any challenge within the party to be ""radical fringe of self serving attention seekers"", I daresay you're not actually into conservatism, but [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink).

>Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. Cohesiveness, or the desire for cohesiveness, in a group may produce a tendency among its members to agree at all costs.[1] This causes the group to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation.[2][3]

In other words, you sound more fitting of the left's Pr spun ""conservative"", conservative of the status quo(bureaucracy, corruption, backroom deals), not actual founding principles or protection of rights.

Edit:  Lol, I checked his post history.

>I'm also a Swede and while I don't want war I'll fight if thats what it takes. If Russia attacks us or our Eastern brothers we'll be there.

rate change - congress does that 

higher pay to offset inflation? The standard deduction goes up every year  - also congress does that 

What part of Bidenomics is aimed at the middle class ? How do these examples show that?

Answer : they don't show anything 


Is 200k considered middle class? No

If you get a good degree, live in or near a city have two people working their asses off and have kids‚Ä¶ you will be making 200 K and you will be living a middle class lifestyle - which I would define as owning a home with decent schools not driving luxury cars but cars that are reliable and fairly new, investing in your retirement and not living paycheck to paycheck.  

If you inherited money from your parents because of THEIR middle class lifestyle.  Maybe you‚Äôre taking vacations because your mortgage is significantly less.

So by defining this group as ‚Äúupper class‚Äù you allow continued taxation to destroy literally one of the most productive groups of people in the US economy.  And it‚Äôs not just Federal taxes‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs who states hit hardest with tax increase and local entities hit hardest with property taxes.  It‚Äôs the single biggest reason people are abandoning the blue states.  Which continues to destroy the tax base.

Add to this the fact that Biden isn‚Äôt just doing this but is advertising that he is going to raise taxes on 401Ks for these people.

Excuse me if I wonder why, in a conservative site, you are worried about someone ‚Äúcherry picking‚Äù real data instead of fighting about how Biden is destroying the middle class in MANY ways in addition to this tax increase",2024-05-09T13:36:25+00:00

In all, the migrants presented 13 demands to the city of Denver. Messages shared with FOX31 show the demands are:

1. Migrants will cook their own food with fresh, culturally appropriate ingredients provided by the City instead of premade meals ‚Äì rice, chicken, flour, oil, butter, tomatoes, onions, etc‚Ä¶ Also people will not be punished for bringing in & eating outside food.
2. Shower access will be available without time limits & can be accessed whenever ‚Äì we are not in the military, we‚Äôre civilians.
3. Medical professional visits will happen regularly & referrals/connections for specialty care will be made as needed.
4. All will receive the same housing support that has been offered to others. They cannot kick people out in 30 days without something stable established.
5. There needs to be a clear, just process before exiting someone for any reason ‚Äì including verbal, written & final warnings.
6. All shelter residents will receive connection to employment support, including work permit applications for those who qualify.
7. Consultations for each person/family with a free immigration lawyer must be arranged to discuss/progress their cases, & then the City will provide on-going legal support in the form of immigration document clinics & including transportation to relevant court dates.
8. The City will provide privacy for families/individuals within the shelter.
9. No more verbal or physical or mental abuse will be permitted from the staff, including no sheriff sleeping inside & monitoring 24/7 ‚Äì we are not criminals & won‚Äôt be treated as such.
10. Transportation for all children to & from their schools will be provided until they finish in 3 weeks.
11. No separating families, regardless of if family members have children or not. The camp will stay together.

Conservative,comment,l37316b,Sallowjoe,,"While we sometimes we use the terms interchangeably, many anarchists would distinguish lack of state from lack of government. State is an institution, government is an activity. 

Any sort of political order requires some governance in a more broad sense. An anarchist society wouldn't remain as such without it, given that if a group of people within it decided to form a state and anarchists just shrugged at them the anarchist order wouldn't last long. Perhaps hypothetically no one in such a society would ever think to do such a thing in theory, but... yeah.

For pro-state political theories the state as institution is supposed to facilitate government to achieve better political order than can be achieved without it. 

Anarchists rather consider the state as an institution to facilitate the imposition of illegitimate order that doesn't constitute governance proper. Even pro-state people would likely agree that this can occur with bad states, but the anarchist goes further to claim it will occur with any state. 

This is also why there can be right and left wing forms of anarchy, depending on the differing basis for rejection of states and the different types of stateless societies they envision. A left wing anarchist may view the state as imposing hierarchical order and want egalitarian order, and vice versa for a right wing.

The former is not the latter.

I'm obviously familiar with the terms if I'm saying your usage doesn't connect to the ways others use them. I also said it was unlikely we'd get a serious explanation. 

This isn't about specific terms, it's about the lack of any coherent system for defining and organizing them in this fashion in general.   

It ignores how exactly broad and universal rights and freedoms are defined, enabled, protected without a big and powerful government restricting others from restricting you. That is one of the most common criticisms of classical liberal theory by conservatives. Appeal to the things on the right is often the basis for the things on the left. 

Further it ignores the ends toward which political ideologies wish to either grow and empower or shrink and disempower the government, which is what defines them better than just juxtaposing government as instrument or obstacle, respectively, as it explains why they view it as such.

It's also just plain historically inaccurate. Nazis got rid of labor unions. Marx promoted workers resisting the seizure of arms.",2024-05-09T12:12:46+00:00

The definition hasn't changed, but that doesn't prevent the word from being misused. Someone practicing anarchic or chaotic behavior isn't truly a political anarchist.  Similarly, the media often misuses terms like ""fascism"" in an attempt to redefine them for a contemporary audience.

OTOH (and tangential to your point) some terms have indeed changed over the years.  For example, the classical meaning of ""political liberal"" would be pretty far to the right, but over the last few decades that word has steadily shifted to the far left.",2024-05-08T21:24:14+00:00

Were you deliberately trying to assemble a word salad?  I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt, but I can't make heads or tails out of most of that paragraph.

>Nazis got rid of labor unions.

Congratulations on nitpicking. That's one of the only true ""right wing"" aspects of the Nazis, and they only did it to consolidate their grip on power and ensure that they could control industry to support their military machine.  And when the Nazis abolished independent labor unions, they created the German Labor Front (DAF), which was a government substitute that claimed it would arbitrate like a union.

>Marx promoted workers resisting the seizure of arms.

Marx himself did, but name a Communist regime that hasn't disarmed its populace or placed extreme restrictions on who could own weapons.  Soviets?  Check.  Chinese? Check. Cubans? Check. Venezuela?

Of this class are judgments and decrees of a court deciding between parties before the court and subject to its jurisdiction, in a trial which has presented the claims of the parties, and where they have received the consideration of the court.

*Throckmorton* was a case about a disputed property that a Californian claimed he had received from the Mexican government while Mexico still controlled California. A federal court had previously ruled that the Californian was entitled to this land, in a proceeding that was initially filed in 1853 and which was finally resolved several years later. However, a second suit was filed in 1876 when it was discovered that the Californian had forged a title document that he had used to aid his claim to the land in the 1853 suit. 

When this second dispute came before the Supreme Court, the Court noted the general maxim that ‚Äúfraud vitiates everything,‚Äù but weighed that against the court‚Äôs interest in the finality of judgments. The Court noted that this dispute had already been fully litigated in the 1853 case, and cited another court‚Äôs balancing of the finality of judgments with the maxim against fraud, stating that ‚Äú[t]he maxim that fraud vitiates every proceeding must be taken, like other general maxims, to apply to cases where proof of fraud is admissible. **But where the same matter has been actually tried, or so in issue that it might have been tried, it is not again admissible;** the party is estopped to set up such fraud, because the judgment is the highest evidence, and cannot be contradicted.‚Äù The Court thus concluded that the interest in the finality of judgments *overruled* the maxim that ‚Äúfraud vitiates everything‚Äù, and thereby affirmed the dismissal of the case.

So, even putting aside the fact that you are confusing contract law with election law, that you are uninformed about standing doctrine, and that you incorrectly think that all ‚ÄúObama judges‚Äù are hopelessly biased, even this one particular case does not stand for the proposition that ‚Äúfraud vitiates everything,‚Äù because in this case, the Court actually *did not find* that fraud vitiated the 1853 case that awarded ownership of the disputed land to the Californian.",2024-05-08T18:42:57+00:00

Why didn't he call for the release of the ballot images to get to the bottom of the state farm arena video?

Why did he claim the courts found nothing when he knows full well the courts illegally refused to hold a hearing within 10 days like they were supposed to, and instead ran out the clock until it was moot and the case was dismissed?

Why does he continue to act like everything is above board and we are criminals for questioning the election, when his own state is missing hundreds of thousands of ballot images?

Says the person who resorted to ad hominem and didn't even attempt to respond to my points directly. You know there is no excuse for what Kemp did, but you still won't admit you are wrong. So you are projecting here because YOUR response is actually what's wrong with political discourse. You are primarily concerned with feelings and protecting your world view.

Conservative,comment,l381l2a,Clarity_Zero,,"Neither of those things are good ideas. Insurance is a business, just like any other. It always has been, and it always will be. People can dress it up as whatever they want, but the bottom line is that it's a service, provided for the sake of benefitting both the insured AND the insurer.

Government has a *very* minimal place in such things. Forcing people to have something if they don't want it? No. Taking control of a system and managing it by themselves? Absolutely not.

*Occasionally* passing and enforcing rules and regulations when serious problems arise? Sure. *Revisiting* those regulations to loosen or tighten them as needed, *after* letting things run their course for a while? Great. Acting for the sake of the people you serve, not for the sake of pushing personal, lobbied, or corporate interests? Terrific.

*That* is what government's role in all things should be. It is *not* the role of government to issue edicts from on high, or decide who deserves what. It is *not* the role of government to decide what is best for *me.* 

Do I make mistakes at times? Of course I do. I'm only human, after all. But that's exactly my point: I'm a human being. And self-determination is *my* God-given right as a human being. *I* decide what is best for me. Nobody in Washington D.C. has any right to a say in the matter. Not even the ones I help put there.

Government works for the people. *They* are *beneath us* on the hierarchy of power. You might've forgotten that, and *they* CERTAINLY have, but *I* absolutely have not. I will *never* forget it.",2024-05-09T01:55:44+00:00

The purpose of insurance is to finance the cost of healthcare, but it fails to accomplish this seemingly simple task under the current system. While I would not normally look to the government as a good steward, the purpose of the insurance company is to profit. The motivation is for the stakeholders profit, not to make sure americans get the medical care they need.

While you may be opposed to the government ""controlling"" healthcare, have you considered how much they control it already? Who can practice medicine, where they can practice it, what tools treatments and medications they can use, and the list just keeps going. The government has either regulated or legislated to control nearly every aspect of our healthcare, at this point it is an illusion that we have a free market.  As it is, our healthcare system is broken and I can't really entertain the chorus complaining about fiscal repercussions while we literally light money on fire fighting proxy wars in which we fund both sides.

We will be hearing among many others:  1.  A motion to dismiss for selective prosecution;  2.  A motion to dismiss alleging Jack Smith was not legally appointed; and 3.  A motion to define the scope of the prosecution team.

The third one will explore the participation of the White House and outside private (very expensive) law firms in the prosecution.  Aside from the political issues, I think there is an allegation that the prosecutor may not legally receive outside assistance.  I know for a fact that outside counsel will not be granted typical prosecutor immunity if sued for wrongful prosecution, etc.  These firms don't want to be exposed.  The White House has falsely claimed all along that they had no participation, so that will also be glorious.

It looks like Judge Cannon intends to air the dirty laundry before dismissing this case.  A perfect and karmic outcome!  

(In regards to dismissal, as reported elsewhere the prosecutor broke the chain of custody and lied to the court.  This would generally result in all boxes and their contents being excluded from evidence.  Judge Cannon has issued an order requiring the prosecutor to provide all documents including all emails regarding the chain of custody.  This may reveal damaging information but is more likely a delay tactic.  My guess is she will schedule argument on the chain of custody motion last.)",2024-05-08T18:43:12+00:00

Conservative,comment,l35mz07,CaterpillarHungry607,,"There is really no such thing as a ‚Äústanding objection.‚Äù Each objection must be made as to each question or answer that is elicited that is inadmissible. Contemporaneously. If the judge had re-assured defense counsel that ‚Äúthe objection is noted for the record and no further contemporaneous objections are needed, and the issue is considered preserved for appeal‚Äù that‚Äôs judicially inappropriate. But I don‚Äôt think the defense team withheld objections for this reason (it wasn‚Äôt said).

For example: ‚Äústanding objections‚Äù to hearsay are somewhat common as a time-saver in proceedings with no jury, because often in those proceedings hearsay is allowed to an extent but cannot be the sole basis for a finding of fact by the court. 

In a trial setting, there is no ‚Äústanding objection‚Äù that would aid the appeals court in identifying which questions and answers were purportedly inadmissible evidence, versus those which were not. Also: the basis matters. Hearsay vs speculation vs irrelevance. Certainly a witness can testify to their name and occupation, for example. There‚Äôs no legally valid objection to that. A ‚Äústanding objection‚Äù tells the appeals court that all questions and answers that are subject to the ‚Äústanding objection‚Äù are equally inadmissible, for the reasons argued in support of the ‚Äústanding objection‚Äù and nothing else. 

The exception to this is a motion in limine. If a MiL is argued pre-trial outside the presence of the jury, the court must rule via instructive order on the admissibility of the evidence the motion regards. Then and only then can counsel claim they had a ‚Äústanding objection,‚Äù because in actuality the evidence would be adduced contrary to a standing Court order. Procedurally very different. THAT is how you get a mistrial. 

It‚Äôs easy to assume that the law is what you think it should be. Ask any competent practicing trial attorney, they‚Äôll tell you exactly what I‚Äôve said here, regardless of bias.

My question for Paul Ryan is, what have these perfect Christian Republicans who act nicer than god, what have they done to maintain our constitutional republic, defend Christian values, and stand up to radicalism that‚Äôs devouring our society and institutions???

Paul Ryan led a House of Representatives under a republican president with a republic led senate‚Ä¶first time in history thats happened. Did he cut spending and reign in the debt that threatens our childrens future? No. Repeal Obamacare? No. Reign in the unconstitutionl 4th branch of government? No. Did he put a stop to illegal immigration? No. What did he do? He spent his time sabotoging Trump

So all we can conclude from this is that either Paul Ryan is full of shit and a fake Christian or he doesn‚Äôt have the courage to defend his country which is much easier to do sitting at a desk compared to the people who lost their lives defending the bible and the flag.

Conservative,comment,l34x9b2,americon,,"Just trying to give a good faith argument for what my understanding of the difference is. The law about holding classified documents requires that you knowingly withhold classified documents. From what I have read, Biden claims to have turned the documents over as soon as his staff found them while Trump kept refusing requests to turn them over and allegedly hid them. Refusing the requests and hiding them shows that he knowingly had them and withheld them which is why what he did is a crime while Biden turned them over without hiding them.",2024-05-08T14:41:25+00:00
Conservative,comment,l33l1ov,asillynert,,"With documents and this case its not the documents its not the payoff. Its the ""how"" with documents case its the lying and refusal to turn them over when subpoena was given. Thats the key difference if like past presidents had turned them over when requested case would never have taken the turn. Hell even if he just refused to look made them do search warrant would have likely been over. Its that he perjured himself and said a search had been completed and then the documents were found in his possession and with evidence that he knew he lied perjured himself. 

As for paying off porn star its NOT the payment its how payment was received. As for her credibility they did NOT change any of facts that matter for criminal case. Which for this its all about if payment was made and how it was made. 100% nothing else matters doesn't matter details of whether it was rawdogging pornstar whether or not he coerced her or was commenting on how much she reminded him of his daughter.  Or whether she hates him or not. She received payment and bank account can establish that. Now where payment came from it was lawyer and lawyer received payments from his campaign fund. Thats the problem. Hush money if he did just pay her there would be no case. 

As for why past presidents or people like biden were not in trouble prosecuted. Is when documents were requested they turned them over. Hell in Bidens case and actually in most cases the documents were turned over before they were even requested. And should be noted usually of lesser significance. 

The reason why they were coming down on Trump like bag of hammers demanding them. Is it was active national security secrets. It was internerary of diplomats visit 10yrs ago that just never got around to being declassified. One document found detailed the nuclear capabilitys of foreign country. With labelings beyond top secret such as ORCON can not be distributed outside department it originated in. Like it should have never left facility that it was shown to him in type of secret. Not something he casually reviews then accidently mixes into non classified stuff and brings back with him. It also contained names and operatives of active operations. 

But thats what makes it so different. Most the documents in other cases are shit that doesnt really matter and they turned it over when asked. It was classified at time but thing was over it wasnt national secret. It was landing schedule of diplomat that happened years ago. At time yes dangerous if leaked as it give people a chance to target them. Now that event is past tense the information serves little or no purpose. And will likely be reclassified and filed in archives. Trump held ongoing national operational secrets in a golf club accessible by strangers. Then lied about turning the documents over.",2024-05-08T07:16:44+00:00

The people who wiped their phones and destroyed evidence repeatedly with Muller, J6 etc. with zero consequences are not all of a sudden interested in protecting and empowering government transparency and accountability. Their goal is to undermine transparency just like they do in other contexts and that's what this case is really about. It's about who controls classification and gets to decide what secrets we the american people are allowed to know. Is it our elected president or the unelected deep state bureaucracy? Article II of the constitution tells us the answer but they are trying to shred the constitution as is par for the course.

The documents that Trump has are merely his copies of documents they are not the only copies as you implied. The government has their own electronic versions this is not about protecting transparency or access to the documents it's about doing the opposite and keeping their secrets out of the hands of the public - that's the opposite of transparency. This case is about setting the precedent that NARA and the establishment get to second guess the decisions of the president regarding state secrets which is extremely dangerous to transparency and represents a gutting of the elected president's power under Article II (as well as violates the separation of powers).

Trump was president when he decided to give himself copies of his own documents to keep for when he was no longer president. They now want to retroactively second guess that decision and keep the information out of the hands of the public. For all you know (and as some suspect) this could be information related to the establishment's own corruption that they don't want to ever see the light of day. And btw your interpretation of post watergate legislation is also wrong. The point of it was to legislate the handling of the documents and record keeping requirements for people who ARE NOT THE PRESIDENT.

2.  Okay, I'm starting to get it.......

 ....you haven't ACTUALLY been following the trial, you've been following exclusively right-leaning commentary, specifically in this instance the admission by special counsel Jack Smith that he had mislead the judge in this case.  Except.....

...what Smith ""misled"" the court about was the order in which the documents in a particular box were organized and stored.  As Smith noted, all of the items listed in the warrant were in the box, along with photographic x-ray evidence of the boxes in their original state.  He claims that it is possible that since some of the items are small, they may have become jumbled in the move.  

But even in a worst-case scenario where the government can't completely track the chain of custody for these documents, that doesn't in any way make them inadmissible, let alone call for dismissing the case.  By the defense's own admission, the documents are all still there!

It's a bullshit stalling tactic, and it's bullshit reporting that isn't  offering accurate analysis.  More importantly, they are preying on people like you in the hopes that you'll buy their bullshit editorializing.  I suggest being a bit more in-depth when it comes to this type of story in the future.

Venturing is a fine compromise for the crowd that insists that girls need opportunities in scouting on top of girl scouts, while still keeping BSA traditional.

The problem is when you are in scouts at that age the most distracting thing in the world is the opposite gender.  Anytime we'd have co-ed campouts or activities the dynamic between the guys would go from being relaxed and learning to everyone  posturing trying to look good in front of the girls.  A lot of kids in our troop were a bit nerdy/shy, scouts was the perfect environment for them to come out of their shells and gain confidence without worrying about girls.  The adults in our troop was mostly people's dads so it was a masculine environment with many male role models which is good as at that age you are becoming a man.

I mean that they were really fun to watch and they were not like school. But you were learning about interesting things (""How does a nuclear plant work?, Where is the waste going?, How do kids your age in country XYZ live?"" etc.) while being entertained. This was actually the way how school should work.

The ""Show with the Mouse"" started by greeting the viewers in four different languages every time. And the show ""Dandelion"" ended with ""...now you can turn the TV off.""
