I am a US citizen. My mother has Indian citizenship. My mother isn't the best with English. She can speak it in basic terms, but I would feel it much better if she used an interpreter. I live in Raleigh, NC. What are the chances that CBP will have a Hindi interpreter for her here at the local airport? I am also wondering if I should type up a document that she can print where I list my address, phone number, length of stay (4 weeks), return ticket confirmation email, and thing we will do here (go to New York for tourism and meet my kid). She can speak very basic English, and she has a hard time following American accents (as opposed to British accents). She doesn't wish to live in the US because most of my brothers and sisters live there. She has some money in her bank account, should she carry the statements? She's never really worked in professional job because she took care of me and my brothers and sisters, which is work, but unfortunately not as widely recognized as such.",2024-05-17T13:23:11+00:00

I'm a christian who have lived in Israel almost entire my life (35m) and i have Israeli citizenship.

In recent years, the security situation in Israel is getting worst, along with the changes in political map which tends to the far right. Which is reflected badly on the christians.

Few years ago i decided to get out ahead before the situation will change drastically and i thought about immigration.

I applied for two last Diversity Visa Program but unfortunitely i was not selected.

Friend of mine contacted few lawyers about immigration with focus on refugee criteria, they told her that there is no sustentional case. She must prove actual persecution. Now she is in Canada with her family.

Maybe it seems as exaggeration, but you can feel the negative attitude toward christians even tho they are not persecuted as at some muslim countries.

I suspect most countries will have the same conclusion as the US if you were to seek asylum or refugee status there.

We will just generally be spending time together and with my family.

She is a legal resident of a EU nation, but she is a citizen of a asian nation that is not part of the Visa Waiver Program so she must fill out a DS-160.

She is worried that because she does not have hotel receipts and a full itinerary of what she will be doing every day that she will get denied and then get a mark on her record. It seems that when she traveled to the UK she followed a guide online and made a very extensive itinerary. From my research, it seems that some european countries require this kind of itinerary, but from what I've read this isn't that case for the US, with many just listing the dates they will visit and the address of where they plan to stay.

She is so worried about it that she is thinking of staying at a hotel just so she can have official documents to prove that she has somewhere to stay, and I think she is planning to create a plan for every day to fill out the itinerary as well.

I told her that if she lists our names and phone numbers (and specifically, she has listed me as a contact in the DS-160), that if they want to confirm anything they will call. But I'm not sure of course, I've never had to go through this process myself.

**So my question is : Will it be a problem that her itinerary simply states the dates she will be here, and the address she will be staying at? She will also provide flight numbers.**

A consular section in Pakistan would have been better equipped to assess your ties to Pakistan. Since you live in Pakistan, you had to show strong ties to Pakistan, not the UAE.

You should have applied in Pakistan. Unless someone is very obviously eligible for a B-1/B-2 visa, they should apply wherever they live.

You recently graduated. Work opportunities in America are much better than in Pakistan. Why wouldn't you look for jobs in America?

immigration,post,1ctxsvw,throwaway-hammock,Risk of working in between H1b expiry and H4 EAD,"Hi everyone! So my wife and I are in a bit of a tricky situation and just wanted to ask for advice.

We moved to the US in 2018 from the UK, we  bought a house and had two children here, this is our home and we plan to stay. We are both here on separate H1b visas, and my spouse’s is due to expire at the end of this month. We’ve seen this coming for a while of course, and so I’ve been in the green card process for a number of years with my employer, but unfortunately the timings haven't worked In our favor. I have an approved PERM and I-140. We have since filed for adjustment of status I-485 and associated I-765 EAD. Because we could see the timings would be tight, we paid for premium processing on the I-140, to allow me to put my spouse on a H4 and get an EAD via that parallel  (potentially faster) oute. I just received the paper i797 notice for the I-140, and concurrently filed I-539 and I-765 to adjust to H4 with EAD.

In any case, based on the current timings, neither of these EADs will come before my wife’s current H1b ends (we have already recaptured all time spent out of the US). My wife had taken a bunch of time off as parental leave for our recent baby, and so financially we are not in a great position right now, as we have eaten our savings to cover this leave. Without my wife’s salary we are short about $3k a month, just on our financial obligations (HCOL area). Because of this, I think we have a good case for an  expedite request, which I will submit as soon as I get the USCIS receipt numbers from my applications.

Best case scenario is that this request gets approved,  and she is out of work for a month, no big deal. But in the worst case and it gets rejected then she could be out of work for 6-12 months – at which point we would teeter on bankruptcy and probably have to return to the UK.

My question is, what is the actual risk of her continuing to work? Firstly, I know this is illegal and we should definitely not do it. But at the same time we have already applied for the I-485 and have never worked without authorization and so we have completed those forms truthfully. 

For example let’s say hypothetically the expedited EAD gets approved and she worked for 1 month in the gap between her H1b and the EAD – would this even be detectable? How about for 6 months? She has a SSN and receives a W2 each year, so there is obviously a paper trail. We of course don’t want to jeopardize the green card process, but at the same time we don’t want to bankrupt ourselves. Is it worth the risk, or just suck it up and hope that we get lucky with the timings? 

Thankfully my wife’s employer is very understanding, but the schedule folks are not too pleased with the wide 1-12 month estimate before she can return! (just writing that makes it seems so silly ‘you can work now in your skilled position in the public interest, but then you have to stop for a bit because the process takes a long time, but don’t worry, you can work again once we get round to it. But we don’t know how long that will be. Feel free to stay though!’ )

immigration,post,1ctx3x2,Head_Counter8127,PERM Processing for Team Lead Position,"Hello,  


To give some context about my experience, I have received a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering in India and a Masters of Engineering in Computer Engineering in US. I have been working for the past 5 years in US from May 2019. My work experience breakdown is as follows:  


1. Freelance Work as an Android Developer for 6 months during my Bachelors.
2. Started working as a Software Developer in my first (old) company from May 2019 to Feb 2022.
3. Old company got acquired by current company in Feb 2022. Due to which, my employment shifted from Feb 2022 to March 2023 to new company as a Software Developer.
4. From March 2023 to current, I am working as a Team Lead in my current company. My current position ""responsibilities"" have not changed much compared to when I started in my old company. The ""only"" new responsibility added is now along with my Software Developer role, I am also responsible for mentoring and leading junior developers on certain projects, based on requirements.  


Given this information, my attorney from the company informed me that based on my credentials and the requirements on the Team Lead position (Bachelor's plus 3 to 5 years experience), a PERM-based case would not be successful I cannot meet this experience requirement without my experience at my current company, and the use of the Master’s Degree cannot likely bring the experience required to satisfy this requirement. I am confused because based on this information, a PERM processing will fail with my existing company even though I do end up getting promoted in this company since I will not have a prior experience fit for my the role. I am not sure, how that makes sense. My attorney informed me that since my ""responsibilities"" in my current role have not changed more that 51% than my previous employment experience, a PERM processing will fail. It somehow make no sense since the experience and skills I have been learning do not count towards making me an ""eligible"" applicant.  


For reference, I am working on a small based company who hardly have any international employees. My previous employer had about 30-40 employees in total and current has about 300. My role will not change significantly since I am working on the same enterprise level project, just with much better newer technology and growth.   


After my discussion with the attorney, I was made aware that if my current company files for PERM, I will not be eligible. But what I am more worried about is, even when I switch, what specific type of roles should I be targeting to not land up in a similar situation with my new role and new employer.  


I would like to know more about someone having gone through a similar situation. I am confused on how to proceed given this information and what steps I should take to get out of this situation. Fortunately, I have about 4+ years remaining for my H1B visa to expire, but I don't want to waste my time if there is no way to get out of it.  


Sorry for the long post and since I am pretty new to PERM processing and it's requirements, any help would be much appreciated. Thank you.",2024-05-17T04:54:10+00:00
immigration,comment,l4exi0x,arble,,"When drawing up the job posting for the PERM recruitment phase, the company cannot specify any experience you have gained on your current job, because when you got that job, you didn't have that experience. When your duties have ""significantly"" changed, it is technically possible to use prior experience from your current tenure with the employer. However, these cases often attract more scrutiny and in some cases employers or their immigration counsel simply won't entertain the possibility as a result, since they're the ones paying.

You are correct in identifying that this can lead to frustrating outcomes in some situations. It's very common for career growth to involve doing substantially the same job, but at a higher level of oversight or responsibility. Your employer is totally at liberty to say that a team lead position requires a certain number of years of experience, and is further allowed to count your years with them (as is very normal in a workplace). Unfortunately the rules for PERM don't work the same way.

Moving employers may be the most pragmatic solution. You immediately get to ""bank"" all your experience accumulated so far.",2024-05-17T05:06:55+00:00

It is that the CR1 gives you a green card immediately, whilst the K1 has the adjustment of status to go through too. The K1 costs more and the adjustment is just not a viable option for many people; being unable to work or travel can be very limiting.

Whilst the K1 is the faster option of the two, there’s a lot more that needs to be taken into account when deciding if it’s the right route for someone. The two visas aren’t really comparable purely based on processing time.

That being said, we chose the K1. It was 11 months from application to holding the visa. It was the best route for us.",2024-05-17T07:08:56+00:00

We have been together for a couple years. She has a b1/b2 visa since she originally applied to visit her family which she never got to because her grandpa passed away. 

Things are better now and we are getting married in India this summer. 

I know i130 takes a lot of time. Can she visit me during this time using her b visa? It’s very hard to wait much longer without her. 

Do I go get married and immediately apply for i130? I don’t want to wait so long because the whole process takes 13-15 months. Which is absolutely wild for a spouse visa. lol 

Can she visit me during this time?

My friend said she should just come in b visa and we just get married in the us. That is apparently frowned upon by uscis. He also said that after marriage she can come and file for adjustment of status as well. I’m not sure what is the best way. I do care about being with her. I don’t want to do anything illegal that will cause issues and delay things more. I just want to start our marriage strong without the distance.

immigration,post,1ctv0b8,CaveDoctors,"If you're on immigration parole (e.g., from South America), can you go on an Alaskan cruise?","Almost all cruises in the United States that start at a domestic port and end at the same domestic port have at least one stop at a foreign port for tax purposes.  Thus, going on an Alaskan cruise (e.g., with Royal Caribbean) means that you'll probably have a stop in Vancouver, B.C., Canada.  Even if you don't get off, you'll need to go through U.S. customs when you debark and thus, you left the U.S. when you shouldn't have.

immigration,post,1ctsev4,Old_Argument5053,Challenging Situation,"
Posted this in the H1B subreddit but not sure it’s visible. 


Hi guys, been a lurker for a while but it’s somewhat obvious that only the people in this sub Reddit might fully understand my situation enough to render some advice. 
 I lost my job a couple of months ago and  have been applying and interviewing for jobs non stop. In the space of three months I have had 4 interview loops and multiple recruiter screens and HM screens. I have gone through receiving a verbal offer and having that rescinded because the company didn’t want to transfer my h1b to finally getting a job offer. 

While I am *extremely* grateful for this potential job opportunity (I cannot stress how grateful I am for this) I cannot help but beat myself about the fact that it is a significant pay decrease and multiple levels below my previous job. It also requires relocation to a new city in the Deep South I have no desire relocating too. i don’t know anyone there and have never been. Asides the compensation, moving to this city is one of my biggest challenges right now having spent a good amount of my time in the US in California. 

I know with being on an H1B visa, this should be the least of my worries as finding a company that is willing to transfer my H1B is paramount amongst all things but I’m human and feel this may stagnant my career. 

I need someone to please talk some sense into me. Help me see why this is a step in the right direction. I’m emotionally drained but at the same time do not want to seem greedy but from the bottom of my soul this is truly bothering me. I understand that this is my only option at the moment. Flagging that I have an approved and portable i140 but my PD is unfortunately not current. I’m from Asia but ROW if that matters. 

Would appreciate kind responses as mentally, I am really struggling. Single, no kids and no ties to current location.

Also adding that I fully mpathize with all H1b holders out there job searching. I was in the market for 4 months and boy is it brutal. I really don’t want to come off as an ungrateful SOB.

immigration,post,1ctrrqh,Friend4Us,"Currently on TPS, what are my options for permanent residency? ","Hello! I am a Ukrainian immigrant who has fled years ago when the war first started in 2022 (my city was first to be hit) so I went to the US under temporary protected status and currently live with my grandmother. In Ukraine I had just graduated from dentistry school with a Physician Stomatologist degree (which is what is needed to be a Dentist) and was in the middle of my ""clinical experience"" when I left, and since being in the US I had to find temporary work in a hospital as a Patient care tech. Also since I left, I have made many connections both with coworkers, friends, and significant others and I now wish to pursue permanent residency/citizenship in the US, how can I go about this?

1. I thought about working for an H1B visa since I would be considered a ""skilled worker."" To practice I have to get licensed (I am currently studying for this) and attend a 2 year transition program on top of degree evaluation by the ECE. (source: https://www.in.gov/pla/professions/dentistry-home/dentistry-licensing-information/#Dentist_by_Unaccredited_College). Also it takes 2 years so I would need to apply for a student visa first I guess.

2. if I go to apply for a student visa (F-1 I think it would be) and then 2 year programs, they require me to show proof of financial responsibility (Internationally Trained Dentist Program | Financial Aid | University of Michigan (umich.edu)), but I don't have enough money/my grandma can't and won't foot the >$80.000/year bill (no sponsorship). This is all made easier if I had a H1B visa which I can convert to a permanent residency (green card) later on, so I can apply for loans via FAFSA. Having a Green Card will also increase my chances of being accepted to this 2 year program for some reason (I can't find the source but I feel like I read that somewhere, but that's besides the financial point). Ultimately, I need a lot of money or a green card to take out federal loans.

3. that takes me back to looking for an H1B visa via a different route. I'm currently looking for jobs in healthcare that provide H1B that I can utilize my degree (or even just a general science/lab tech jobs, anything at all) but it seems most H1Bs are related to technology industry.

So I feel kind of stuck and stressed out because I don't understand everything about immigration processes but I want to be a dentist here and move on with my life. I don’t want to consider marriage as an option just yet, even if it is the easier and quickest option.  Does anyone have any recommendations? Am I missing something or did I get something wrong? Is there another way I am not considering when I should be?

immigration,post,1ctrcxe,Top_Extension_2782,DO I HAVE A BAN TO RE-ENTER USA (just to visit),"I would like to share with you my situation and see if you can help me to see clearly.
back in 2012, I moved to the USA in NYC as a student with a F1 visa. In 2013, I got married to my then boyfriend since 2010. My visa was still valid at this time. We then started the process of applying for a green card for me and submitted a I130 since we got married as it would be easier for me to move forward and move on from school. We received a case receipt number MSC for form I-797. After a few months, the relationship became abusive and unhealthy and I then decided to get divorced. The divorced was completed in 2015. Unfortunately the lawyers I spoke to at the time did not advise me to apply foR VAWA or any help for women in unhealthy relationships, and only said that I can fix my situation by getting married again. The divorce went through and I then found myself out of status since my visa had then expired. Despite getting divorced, the unhealthy relationship kept going and I found myself in a wheel that I took years to get out of. I ended up working in the USA even if I didn’t have the proper documentation for it but always paid my taxes. During this time my application for my green card was of course never completed. I ended up staying 10 years in the USA after my visa expired. Fast forward, I was able to cut cord with my ex husband and made the decision to leave the USA last year, in November 2023. I am aware that there are bans of 3,5, and 10 years depending on the situation. I would like to know if there is a way for me to know if I have a ban, and if so how long. I am not trying to move back to the USA, but would like to visit friends. My I-94 has D/S Instead of an expiration date, and I would like to know if this means that I will not have a ban. 
If you can please help me to have a better idea. ",2024-05-16T23:42:25+00:00

I entered at the end of Sept with the intentions of staying for 79 days with my boyfriend - i was taken to secondary screening because I didn’t have a job (was taking time off after a rough year and didn’t have a job lined up). I also brought my dog in the cabin with me. They gave me a verbal warning not to return any time soon or I would be denied. I married my boyfriend during this trip but I actually ended up leaving the US after 39 of the 79 days because a family member passed away and I returned home to be with my family, then got a job etc. My husband returned to Ireland with me.

My British passport expired in Jan 24. I now have an Irish passport and applied for a new ESTA on this passport, I didn’t think anything of it because I know they will tie my fingerprints together and have the full picture of my travel history anyway, since it’s per person and not passport.

I am planning to enter the US for a 2.5 week holiday. I’ll have been out of the US for over 200 days at that point. I have a job (at my old company from the initial short stay in August/September) and I have bought a house recently in Ireland. My husband is still with me in Ireland (legally!) and he intends to apply for a visa to live with me permanently here when we visit the US. I will be travelling with my husband, my dog and his cat.

What are the chances that CBP will interrogate me on entry and deny entry based on the last experience entering the US? 

I am not trying to be evasive with changing passport country, the old one was expiring anyway but I am worried about this. I am concerned they’ll question me about why I am working for the old company again too. I have zero intentions of staying beyond the trip and have return ticket, pet compliance check booked for the return ticket date.

immigration,comment,l4egok6,Efficient_Bowler5804,,"Yes, you will not be allowed in. What you are doing (coming to the US to give birth) itself is against the rules.

[Birth Tourism Update (state.gov)](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visas-news-archive/20200123_birth-tourism-update.html)

US government's own website itself explicitly says that traveling to the US to give birth is not allowed. Do not tell that to CBP officials or the consular visa officer or they will deny you. Best to avoid traveling to the US if you are already pregnant because they can force you to take a pregnancy test, as well as check your phone, laptop, etc.

However, like I said, you are allowed to enter the US with the purpose of visiting while not being pregnant, then become pregnant, and stay until you give birth, but you will overstay. If you overstay, you won't be immediately picked up by ICE unless you trigger them (you get arrested for an unrelated crime, you work illegally and the workplace is raided by ICE, etc), especially if you are in a blue state like California or New York.

Either way if you give birth in the US on a tourist visa, you will probably never receive another tourist or any nonimmigrant visa again. You can get a green card if your US born baby turns 21 years old and decides to sponsor you. However, the US consulate can also invoke 212 (a) (6) (c) (i) \[Fraud and wilful misrepresentation\] later when you apply for another visa, and that will permanently ban you from the US unless your husband/wife or your parents are US citizens and you can prove it will cause extreme hardship to them. Children DO NOT qualify for a 212a6ci waiver, so your US born child cannot be used to waive it. 

Simply put, even if you have a baby in the US, next time you will not be allowed in.",2024-05-17T02:43:34+00:00

Furthermore, you will not be able to provide a better life for your child in any country if you don’t have a right to stay and a legal status there! You will NOT be able to stay in the US if you give birth there. That means your child would be the only one who might be able to get himself a better life in the US decades down the road.

Im a Palestinian Refugee who was born in Syria. I've been a Canadian citizen since the age of 5 when my family immigrated to Canada.

I'm currently going through the IR1 visa, and my spouse is a USC.

I submitted my birth certificate (original copy along with the verified translated copy), the one provided to the Canadian embassy, and verified by them when we immigrated...

All of our NVC documents say were accepted but my birth certificate has a notice message saying it's not the right one.
The one I submitted has a blue eagle seal as described on the NVC website. 

What do I do? Do I resubmit the same document and in the notes point out the seal??
There is simply no other document for my birth certificate that I can provide them.

immigration,post,1ctexeq,henlee69,How soon can I return to the US,"I travelled to the US on May 30th 2023 with a J1 visa to work at a summer camp. I stopped working at the summer camp September 8th and travelled the US for around 25 days before heading to Mexico with the view to enter on an ESTA (was told by both my sponsor and camp placement in the UK this would be fine).

Worth mentioning a couple of days into my travels that I met an American and we hit it off so well that I ended up using his place as my base whilst travelling.

Returning back to the US from Mexico I got pulled at Houston and was told I can’t simply go from a J1 to an ESTA and had to go for a secondary interview. I’d quit my corporate job to work for the summer camp so had sufficient funds and proof of travel plans for the following 90 days of travel. After some questioning my passport was stamped allowing me 90 days and I was on my way…

I left the US December 30th (so that’s 7 months spent in the US in 2023) and have been in new employment and renting since January.

My American “friend” (it’s more than that but we don’t really have a label due to the distance) visited me in the UK in April and now I’m planning to visit him.

I’m currently interviewing for a number of jobs with a start date of 27th August so my plan is to quit my job and visit him in July for say 5 weeks with some road trips in between, returning in time to start my new job.

My question is… How soon realistically can I go back to the US? And for how long? I’m terrified that because I got pulled into a secondary interview last time I’ve now put a target on my back. 

I can bring: proof of rent, a decision in principle for a mortgage (I’m planning to buy a house once I’m in new employment), proof of funds, return flight etc…

There are so many horror stories on here so I’m hoping someone has been in a similar situation and got through fine.

CBP are  likely to suspect that you are not a good risk for exiting in good order.

Rent/mortgage offer/start date for new job are all fairly weak ties.

It wouldn't be a bad idea to wait a while before visiting again. 

Also if you are not allowed entry on an ESTA then you will lose ESTA privileges forever and would have to apply for a B1/B2 and that is hard to get from ESTA applicable countries.

It's actually a MUST according to 8 USC § 1186a. The US government makes illegal mistakes all of the time. Just because they make the mistake doesn't mean whatever mistake they made is now legal. All governments regularly get sued for doing things that are perceived to be illegal.

Just as if someone's green card was denied incorrectly, approving one incorrectly can also happen (or in the wrong category). But the government can't override the law. That's why we have separation of powers.

Some sections of the law allow for discretion of the agency to do or not do certain things, but this particular section has no discretionary element.

If you've dealt with the DMV you should understand that. If you're married less than 2 years when you receive the green card it is SUPPOSED to be a 2 year conditional.

I'm not going to go look for case studies and examples but every reputable lawyer I keep up with recommends to still file the i-751. Why would you possibly jeopardize your work so far just because you feel like you don't need to prove anything.

You may be fine but others may not and trying to downplay the importance of getting the mistake fixed is simply bad advice. USCIS is not going to be looking for these mistakes or even notice until you go to naturalize.",2024-05-16T15:23:45+00:00

Before you judge how bad of a criminal I am, it was part of a police sting and the design was such that i got tricked in to making the offence. Couldnt win the argument of entrapment, some individuals did eventually win after a long battle. 

Now I want to immigrate to a new country on a work visa. But this record is stopping me from getting a visa. Will changing my name and not declaring past convictions get me a clean slate to start my life afresh.",2024-05-16T13:42:18+00:00

immigration,post,1ctcpp9,Express-Tea-9038,H1b extension + change of status,"My current visa will expire in 1 month, my current employer filed my H1b extension for 10 days (they initially filled it wrong so I needed 10 more days until the end of my current contract). After this 10 days, I will change my status to H4.

However, my i-129 form (H1b extension) is still pending and I am not sure when I will get the approval. In the meanwhile, can I apply for the H4 even without the extension approval (to start after that 10 days extension)? I am afraid the H4 might be denied due to this gap. 

I was also thinking, if I apply to the H4 now (with the H1b extension still pending), it will probably only be processed after the H1b extension is approved (as it has been 2 months from the application). 

Is there ok to have two applications pending? Can I stay in the US with those pending?

immigration,comment,l4cvpxl,quixoticsaber,,"It's possible, depending on how serious the threats are. I don't know how likely it is, especially in a world of post-Covid interview backlogs. 

For DCF: a post can accept a direct filing if ""beneficiary is facing an imminent threat to personal safety"". They can only accept the petition if you're physically present in their consular district, and ""residence is a factor for acceptance under [...] the exceptional circumstances [...] authorizations"". [9 FAM 504.2-4(B)(1)](https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM050402.html#M504_2_4_B_1).

If you can show that she's in serious danger of immediate physical harm, _and_ the police are unlikely to be able to protect her, then it's worth reaching out to the consulate and asking. DCF would be the fastest way forward, and the worst they can do is say no.

From what you've said, I don't think this rises to that level yet, though--and since you're not physically there right now, I suspect they'd direct you to file with USCIS anyway instead of encouraging you to travel. 

USCIS also have [expedite criteria](https://www.uscis.gov/forms/filing-guidance/expedite-requests), which are a bit less stringent. One of the examples of urgent humanitarian situations is a ""vulnerable person whose safety may be otherwise compromised"".

Once USCIS has processed the petition, expedited or not, you can [contact NVC to request that they expedite the rest of the process](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/national-visa-center/immigrant-visas-processing-general-faqs.html#ivp7). 

My own case was expedited. We first asked USCIS to expedite, but they completed normal processing before making a decision on the expedite request. We then contacted NVC, who contacted the consulate which agreed to expedite the case, and the NVC stage was skipped. I submitted all my civil documents directly to the consulate.

We were represented by a lawyer, and they wrote up the request and helped us with the supporting documentation.  We also reached out to my wife's congressional representative for help; they have caseworkers who have better access to USCIS, who can often get a faster response than the public.",2024-05-16T20:21:15+00:00

You can naturalize without lengthy residence in the Netherlands if you've been married for 3 years to a Dutch citizen. Check out the IND website.

If your spouse isn't dutch, then have her naturalize first as a US citizen. Netherlands allows you to keep your dutch citizenship after you naturalize in a foreign country if you're married to a citizen of that foreign country.

immigration,post,1ct882n,shivi91,M visa (Spouse visa) for Colombia,"Hello! Me (Indian) and my wife (Colombian) recently applied for the M visa for Colombia; however, we got an update yesterday that it was denied. What's worse is that no reason was given for the denial. If this wasn't bad enough, the earliest we can reapply is after six months. I reside in New Delhi, India, and I believe the visa study was conducted at the Colombian Embassy in New Delhi. I tried contacting them, but they didn't provide any reasons for the disapproval.

We met in the US in 2017 and have been together ever since. I returned to India earlier this year as my US work authorization ended last year. We got married in India recently, and now, I am planning to move to Colombia. Because she has her own company in Bogotá, she cannot simply abandon the family business to settle in another country. 

To provide more background, I traveled to Colombia in 2021 with a tourist visa. But when I reapplied for the tourist visa again in December 2023, the status was ‘not admitted,’ and they requested additional documentation. However, despite providing them with the requested documents, the status didn't change, and I did not proceed with the application.

The purpose of my post is to gather any opinions/suggestions/advice on what we can do to navigate this situation. I fear if they don't explain the reasons for denying the M visa this time, there's no guarantee that they will approve it when we reapply after six months. Knowing the reasons will help us apply with more confidence in the future. 

I would like to know if anyone has had a similar experience and what they did to resolve it. If you can suggest other Reddit channels where I can post this, I would appreciate it.

The agent was very friendly and understanding but said she could not admit him for more than the time it took to catch his connecting flight, which was totally fine. His I94 had the same day for admitted and admit until date. Again, no issue whatsoever as he had no intention to stay longer.

Is there any country that has a good quality of life, that I can realistically and easily migrate to given my current situation? If yes, what’s the procedure?

This is why I recommend keeping Canada in the game. Things are kinda bad here, but only if you're stuck on Toronto/Vancouver/Montreal. Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton are slightly more sober atm. No one can predict for how long they'll stay that way though. The US is a special shit show so pretty much any country out there has the benefit of being NOT USA. 

If you're giving up the H1B fight from a values perspective, Canada is miles better. If it's more of an economic outlook pov, then not many countries look positive rn, so you're better off continuing the fight to retain status in the US. Consider interviewing for Canadian roles - I think the upside is that you'll have less mental re-adjusting to do to Canada's culture/landscape.

You mentioned two Master's degrees: the UK launched a visa in 2022 for graduates of certain US/Canadian universities. You'll be eligible for a 2 year open work permit to go figure it out there. If you're sponsored for a third year, you can get an ILR and citizenship one year later.

immigration,post,1ct0aok,Anna_Delvey2,Can someone help me to find what might have caused my B1/B2 visa cancellation and refusal and denied entry as a new Canadian citizen?,"Below is the US travel history:

In 2015, I obtained B1/B2 visa with my Chinese passport (my only nationality at that time), travelled from Canada to the US for the first time, no issues with entry or exit. I was a student in a Canadian university. After this trip, my passport along with the visa was lost.

In 2017, I got a new B1/B2 visa with my new Chinese passport. Travelled from Canada to the US in March 2018 for business. I was working as a researcher for an agricultural company. My status in Canada was temporary residence with post graduate work permit, was in the process of getting a PR. My B1/B2 visa was cancelled by the US consulate in April 2018 after I came back from the business trip. Reason was that new information became available after the visa was issued.

In 2018 May, I applied for a visa for business travel again, it was refused. The refusal came after the in-person interview. There's no detail/reason why it's refused.

I became a Canadian citizen and cancelled my Chinese citizenship in 2023. Between 2018 and 2024, I also changed jobs but still with the same company.

In 2024, I went to the US border with my Canadian passport and was denied entry. CBP couldn't tell me more details but said that I was on the inadmissible list. I will have to apply for a new visa or a security letter for future entry into the US.

I've consulted with immigration attorneys, they told me that I could write to the US consulate asking for details but may never get a response. Without knowing the reasons, I'm not sure how to prepare for future visa applications.",2024-05-16T00:32:16+00:00

immigration,post,1csztd2,idontass,Derivative through family preference F1 category - follow to join,"Hello good folks. I have a somewhat complicated question but I believe someone might know an answer here.

-Grandma is a U.S. citizen

-She petitioned for her adult, unmarried daughter back in 2012 under F1 category along with her derivative granddaughter who was 18 at the time.

-Petition’s PD is 2nd May 2014

-Adult daughter recently got approved for immigrant visa at the US embassy in 2024 and already has the stamped passport in hand.

-Granddaughter decided not to go to the interview since she assumed she has aged out and no longer eligible. (Now 29 years old)

-Her name however still shows up under the NVC application portal under “follow to join”

So my question is, is there any harm for the granddaughter to go ahead and proceed with filling out the application and pay the IV fee? Especially now that her mother has the immigrant visa in hand?

Is she even eligible? Did her age froze or no?

If she’s no longer eligible does that mean the only option left now is for the granddaughter to wait until her mother becomes a US citizen and then fall back in queue for 15+ years?

The answer to this is not exactly, if the granddaughter is unmarried. Her mother can file an F2B petition as soon as the day she arrives in the US on her immigrant visa. The catch is the granddaughter has to stay unmarried until mom naturalizes (at which point it becomes an F3 petition, just with an earlier priority date than if they waited until the naturalization to file) or the visa is available, whichever is first.",2024-05-16T01:29:33+00:00

In March I had an appointment but I couldn't show up and I missed the appointment.
This month in May, I got another interview but they gave me the 214(b).

I think I know the reason why they denied it to me. And I believe that it was because I was not prepared and I made the mistake of asking a travel agency to fill out the DS160 for me. The agency was supposed to train me, but they didn't. I didn't know that in DS160 the agency had stated that I want to go to New York. In the interview I said that I wanted to travel to San Francisco and after that make a stopover to travel to Japan. I think that's why they denied it to me. 
Since I am a university student in my country, I have had an American visa, my parents also have an American visa, I have my car, I work in the family business and I earn 1k a month (which for my country is not a low salary).

If I recall correctly, Puerto Rico is like a US state in that there's no customs/immigration but there is a TSA checkpoint like in any other airport and a USDA check as well. Beware of trying to smuggle an apple back into the US!

USVI on the other hand have a visa check on the way back in. They do not stamp your visa, but they check that you are in the US legally. As a USC, you can travel with a drivers license. As a GC holder, you should use your foreign passport and GC or pending EAD. As a visa holder, you should use your foreign passport and visa.

I remember all the checks being very nominal. In one case I believe I even traveled on an expired visa which was awaiting renewal. That was good enough for them. I probably wouldn't recommend that.

Here’s our scenario:

-I’m 18 years old (only recently turned)

-I’m in the US currently on a student visa (for college)

-After spending some time here I realized that I want to stay

-My grandma is a US citizen

-My mom is above 21 and married

-I’m from Jordan, a country with a relatively small population compared to other countries (which I think means less backlog)

So what if my grandma petitioned for my mom, would she be able to petition for me as a dependent since I’m under 21? Well my primary question would be, if she does petition for me would I age out and not be eligible as a dependent anymore as soon as I turn 21 or will my age be “frozen” somehow? I was thinking since I would already be in the US on a student visa I could eventually get on AOS if I can make it in time and keep extending my stay (college, OPT, masters, phd etc.)

Also would a k-3/4 visa work in this situation?

USCIS is known to often assign lower priority to family petitions that are in heavily backlogged categories, on the basis that the approval won't matter for many years, but expecting them to sit on it for a full two decades is a stretch.

There's no extra up front cost for adding derivative beneficiaries to family petitions, so if your grandmother is seriously considering this then she might as well you to your mother's petition. Just be aware that you have at least 20 years to wait, and will likely have to add on another 15 for your mother's separate petition for you if you age out of your grandmother's petition.",2024-05-15T21:54:54+00:00

EDIT :-  The MAIN CONCERN ;- My aunt and uncle did contact a family attorney and they said that we will have to contact my father for “handing over my custody” since he would be my local guardian in the US but I really just wanted to know if there was some way around it since that is not a feasible option.

immigration,comment,l47pdvn,quixoticsaber,,"From an immigration point of view, you just need a US passport. If you don't have one already, there are instructions on how to apply on the [embassy website](https://in.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/passports/).

I assume you'll be living with your aunt and uncle rather than your father; they will need some paperwork to be able to act as your legal guardians to do things like enroll you in school or deal with a medical emergency. That process varies from state to state, and your aunt/uncle should find a local family law attorney for this part. 

Once they have the power of attorney or guardianship paperwork, you'll just need to fly to the US. You'll want to carry a signed letter from your mother explaining you have permission to travel alone and where you're going, and a copy of the guardianship paperwork to show at immigration.

EDIT: the above is from a *US* immigration point of view, /u/lakehop makes a very good point about your Indian citizenship. India doesn't allow dual citizenship. So, the question is, how did you travel to India when you were 6? 

If your parents applied for a US passport and an OCI/PIO card or visa for you, then nothing changes from what I've written above. If you have an Indian passport, it's more complicated. I suspect that by applying for the US passport you'd effectively be giving up your claim to Indian citizenship, but I don't know much about Indian law here.",2024-05-15T20:58:25+00:00

immigration,comment,l479xjt,delcodick,,"What leads you to that incorrect conclusion and misrepresentation of my carefully
Chosen words?  🤷‍♂️

The Immigration and Nationality Act does not recognize proxy marriages unless consummated, i.e., unless the couple has had “marital relations” after the ceremony. The statute provides: “The term “spouse”, “wife”, or “husband” does not include a spouse, wife, or husband by reason of any marriage ceremony where the contracting parties thereto are not physically present in the presence of each other, unless the marriage shall have been consummated.”


The State Department further explains:
A marriage where one or both parties was not present (proxy marriage) is not valid unless the marriage was consummated.

(1) Consummated: For the purpose of issuing a visa to a “spouse,” a proxy marriage that has been subsequently consummated is deemed to have been valid as of the date of the proxy ceremony. A proxy marriage consummated prior to the proxy ceremony cannot be considered a valid marriage for visa adjudication purposes unless it has been consummated subsequently.

(2) Unconsummated: A proxy marriage that has not been subsequently consummated does not create or confer the status of “spouse” pursuant to INA 101(a)(35)…. [A] party to an unconsummated proxy marriage may be processed as a nonimmigrant fiancé(e). A proxy marriage celebrated in a jurisdiction recognizing such marriage is generally considered to be valid; thus, an actual marriage in the United States is not necessary if such alien is admitted to the United States under INA provisions other than as a spouse.

– 9 FAM 102.8-1(D) Proxy Marriages

How prove do you consummation?

Evidence of consummation could include evidence that the parties were in the same location on a particular date after the marriage (e.g., airplane tickets and any admission stamps in passport(s), hotel bills, photos taken together) and a declaration (without graphic details) explaining that the couple had “marital relations.”",2024-05-15T19:29:31+00:00

Just a little bit of background context, my cousins from my dad side are about 10 years old and 12 years old. Their dad (my uncle) is very irresponsible and have history of always drinking alcohol and is often chasing the high. Their mom is in Singapore to work, and before all these, the main caretaker/guardian was my grandmother who unfortunately passed away. 

My cousins are not orphan by any means, just have a dad who is not there and a mom who is in another country. Other relatives of mine are not coming up and volunteer to take them in, and so they’re currently with my other uncle who isn’t necessarily a fan, let’s just say that. 

Now I’m in the US, and so I don’t know how all these works, not to mention I’m barely 20. If possible, I would want my parents to adopt them from Myanmar. Is there any possible ways to this to work? The costs?

immigration,comment,l49hfrf,ImmLaw,,"Department of State decisions are not reviewable by the courts. They know this so it allows them to do whatever they want without explanation. USCIS decision, by contrast, can be appealed administratively and/or to federal court. As a result, they have to be much more measured in their decision making. If they don't like the case they will send a request for evidence explaining why. If they deny they will send a decision notice outlining the reasons why and it can be appealed. In short, the USCIS experience should be very different.",2024-05-16T04:29:08+00:00

immigration,comment,l45mxeb,Merisielu,,"As a UK citizen who just moved to the US, I can weigh in somewhat.

Firstly, to get employment-based sponsorship you need a niche and skilled profession so that a US company can show they need to hire you and not an American citizen. It costs them $10k or so to sponsor… so they need to be investing in someone for a good reason. Unless you’re in STEM or the holder of a PhD you’re unlikely to find this very straightforward. The other way would be a company that is US-based and working for them in the UK with the hopes of transferring but the other stuff still applies and it’s tentative at best.

Aside from that, you need family sponsorship or marriage to get there. 

Marriage has two routes: fiancé visa and spousal. 
Both require proof of a genuine bonafide marriage, or the intent to have one. 
This is things like submitting: a joint lease/ mortgage, shared bank accounts, shared insurance, shared bills, affidavits from friends and family, photographs, receipts, travel history, etc.
Both take a good while; the fiancé visa is taking around 12 months to process and then there’s a period when you cannot work in the US, whilst the spousal takes around 2 years. Both cost a decent amount.

The US has more extreme weather than the UK, can you handle 38° C summers, cause a lot of the US has them.

Correct. She will have trouble adjusting status based on marriage.

I601a waiver will not help her because she would have to return to Cuba and she claimed asylum.  Unless she could get a 3rd country processing of her marriage based visa.


I would still get married asap and file i130 and i485.

Maybe she will get a surprise parole in the mail.

immigration,post,1cse50l,Perfect-Canary-3033,Visiting gf for a 1 month as an unemployed individual on B2 visa. how do you strengthen by chances of not being sent back my CBP officer?,"I intent to visit my gf on a B2 visa for a month, I am currently unemployed and was previously employed at a big tech company that I left before I got my VISA approved on ground of business school visitation, and I intent to apply for business schools later this year, and visiting some of my preferred schools will be my secondary objective for this visit, also this is my first travel abroad. I am from a developing nation.

I'll be staying with my gf, moving from West coast to east for 2 weeks each.

Considering I have sufficient funds, 6K USD for my visit.

How do I strengthen my chances of not being send back? I know the whole gf visitation, plus, being unemployed puts me at risk of being denied entry, I intent to bring along my bookings for a return flight

1.Should I make school visitation my answer to purpose of visit, and only mention my gf when asked where I'd stay?

2.will having some English proficiency exam scheduled on return in my home country help to prove my intent of return if asked?

3.would having some small loan on electrical appliances help to show strong ties or does that put things against me. ( I only have phone/cooking gas bills to show)

4. I also would have confirmations for school visits on varied dates through this 1 month period. 

5. Any other suggestions to strengthen my case.

4. These will help but would likely never be asked for. Don’t volunteer stuff that isn’t asked for, that raises red flags.

5. Have a return ticket you can show if asked. Have at least a vague itinerary of what you’ll do in the U. S. that you can describe if asked.

You have to leave the country for a while and try to recapture time (or leave with one day remaining on your H1B so that you can Continue to get an extension based on approved I-140 or perm pending for 365 days).

immigration,post,1csbmgf,Froehlich21,Does it matter where an immigration lawyer is located?,"Had an interesting discussion with a friend: They live in the US and are a US citizen by birth. They are also first generation with a Thai mother. They told me they would like to sort out their Thai citizenship (they only have a US birth certificate, etc.). To do so, they would like to get help from an immigration lawyer who can help them navigate the bureaucratic processes in Thailand. As I understand it, this is less about immigration / naturalization and more about getting paperwork in order and claiming a citizenship they have from birth.
 
Question: what kind of lawyer are they looking for? And should they look for a US based immigration lawyer who has Thai language skills or a Thailand based immigration lawyer who speaks English?",2024-05-15T03:45:48+00:00
immigration,comment,l441r02,Usasinee,,"Depending on where your friend is in the U.S., he/she can contact Thai consulate-general for the matter directly. (Don’t need to use attorney)

For example, Royal Thai Consulate General in New York is responsible for serving residents in 10 Northeastern states of the U.S., or so-called consular jurisdiction, namely, which are Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont. (Your friend has to do a bit of research in which consulate provides the service for the state he/she residing) 

I tried to get the information in English but not yet found one. However, the link below (in Thai) is explaining of what to do and which documents would be needed to register and get Thai ID.

Seeking guidance on on what kind of evidence or pointers are needed for L1A visa case. I have an understanding that I need to be employed in a 'managerial' title/capacity in my company (outside US). But I am looking for what makes a case more convincing? I have almost 5 years of work experience but I am looking to switch my current company and ask my next employer to help file for L1A - I am currently in the US but will relocate to other country (mostly India) to make myself eligible for L1A. To my potential employer, I am trying to ask for a position/title that would make the L1A process smooth. Can I have a non manager like title like 'analyst 3' etc but still have people reporting under me on the hierarchy? My country of birth is India. My preference for L1A is just make the GC timeline shorter - considering it's way too difficult for other visa categories for someone with birthplace India.

I have few more questions. It would be great if you could help me get clarity on them.
On Two-tiered structure - What is considered a 'professional'? Like is it a title that signals one is professional or it has to something else? Are external consultants seen as professionals
On Three tiered - Can vendors/contractors who report into me considered as part of the org chart? Note that they have their own titles and exist like an employee and there is nothing that can distinguish between a true employee and a contractor or vendor personal except the ID number nomenclature that is different for vendors and employees. Rest all things are same in the org chart/records - vendors have a department just like I do, a title/designation (taken as is in their parent organisation).

immigration,post,1csaoa7,Fan_Housing_7323,Successful adoption for IR-2 AOS,"Every once in a while cases about adoption and US immigration appear here, and I just wanted to add our data point and offer anecdotal insight for others going through the same or similar things.

My spouse and I adopted a teenage son some years ago that was also undocumented with legal entry made at a young age. We had already known this child for the majority of his life. As his family's circumstances deteriorated, we eventually decided mutually with his parents to adopt him. The child's parents are also undocumented and in the country.

This was not easy. First, adoption-based family I-130 petitions take **significantly** longer than normal petitions. Only in June 2023 did USCIS start publishing adoption-based petition timelines. Up until recently, the immediate relative I-130 category for adoption-based, non-orphan I-130 petitions was more than 53 months. They are processed centrally at NBC at a special office.

Second, the evidentiary burden is very high. But, with the right fact pattern and very careful legal work, it's possible to pull off even if the biological parents are still around and the child is older. There are a few controlling precedent BIA cases that set out some of the evidentiary standards required in these cases that are imperative to understand as a petitioner. Two include Matter of Marquez and Matter of Cuello.

Third, the Hague Convention issue, if it applies, can kill a case before it even starts. Knowing what you're up against relative to the Hague Convention at the very beginning is crucial for anyone attempting this.

And finally, there are only a handful of attorneys nationally that actively specialize in these types of cases. It is imperative that petitioners use someone who specializes in adoptions and immigration, rather than any other family-based immigration lawyer or service.

In the end, our case was successful, and we're all happy to be together as a family. It was a lot of work, diligence, and dedication. Hope this helps & DMs are fine for any specific questions if I know the answer.",2024-05-15T02:54:16+00:00

immigration,post,1cs9usb,TheAncientLegend13,Need advice on H1B cap-exempt petition while unemployed on STEM OPT,"Hi everyone,

I need some advice regarding my current visa situation. Here are the details:

* I'm currently on F1 visa and recently got my STEM OPT extension approved.
* My last day with my current employer is on 5/17/2024, and I will start accruing unemployment days on my STEM OPT after that (I have more than 140 days of unemployment left)
* I have a tentative job offer from a cap-exempt company starting on July 1st, but they don't have an e-verify number, so they plan to sponsor my H1B visa (cap-exempt) and apply for premium processing sometime between May last week and June 1st week. This will be after my employment ends with my current employer and I will be unemployed at the time of filing this petition.
* The company's attorney mentioned there might be an issue with petitioning for a cap-exempt H1B while I'm unemployed on STEM OPT. However, I can only start working there once my H1B is approved and my status changes to H1B.

Given this situation, I'm concerned about the legal implications of being unemployed on STEM OPT while my H1B petition is being processed. Can anyone share their thoughts or experiences?

A family member applied for a B1/B2 visa. He was put into administrative processing (refused under 221g) so he requested the passport back in the interim and travelled. 


Two months go by and he receives an email from the consulate with a 214(b) refusal. CEAC still shows long text refusal (Administrative Processing) even though the CEAC has been updated on the day he receives the 214b which was yesterday.


Could that be an error on the consulate’s part or it will update again in a few days with short text final refusal? Thanks.

immigration,post,1cs8p25,Jonathan_Nam,K1 Visa Experience,"Hello everyone, after reading numerous comments comparing fiancee vs spousal visas and how the K1 isn’t a viable option anymore since “they’re both currently taking the same amount of time to process”, I am here to shed some light on my experience in applying for a K1.

Context: me, USC 24M applying for 23F in the Philippines. Met on Tinder and applied with 4 months total relationship time. When we considered which visa to go for, we opted for K1 since we wanted to get together asap AND it seemed considerably faster to get approved after doing a basic analysis of people’s timelines on Myvisajourney. The data is still there.

They received my application on Feb. 15 this year, sent NOA1 on Feb. 19, and my I-129F got approved on May 13. I have screenshots to prove it if really needed. Based on people’s timelines, it looks like it’ll be another 2-3 months until she has her interview, and I believe another 1-2 weeks from there until she’s able to move here. I don’t recall any spousals getting fully approved in 7–8 months.

The other downsides for the K1 are of course still present but were not deal breakers for us at the time of choosing, and it looks like it will pay off.

I am not telling you to pick one over the other. I will tell you to do your own research before choosing.

The beneficiary can still get their SSN, driving license, bank account, etc., in the time before the AoS, but many people would find the limits on work and travel too difficult.

immigration,post,1cs8mvg,shooktsister,PLEASE HELP. Should I apply for N-400 or wait? ,"I'm in the process of applying for my citizenship and I have been a permanent resident/green card holder since 2014. I didn't apply for N-400 as soon as I was eligible after 5 years because I wanted to just wait until the time that my green card expires. I started the application a few days ago and I got to the background check portion of the form. Soooo, back in March of 2020 I got arrested for a DUI charge for marijuana. I got pulled over because a worker at the Mcdonald's drive-thru that I was at called 911 and reported me apparently. I went to court and paid all my fines and the DUI was reduced to reckless driving since my driving record was clean. I also attended the appropriate classes that the judge assigned me. I believe I attended 3 different victim panels and acquired a paper that stated that I did it. Also, my drivers license was never suspended or anything like that. I wasn't put on probation neither like the other cases that I have read online. I didn't have any DUIs or reckless driving of some sort after as well, just that one time in 2020. Now, my question is should I follow through with this application? I'm just really worried because it's still within the 5 years for my background check so I will have to disclose I just don't want to waste my time, effort, and money because it's not cheap 😥 Any insight would be appreciated.

I got selected for the DV Lottery 2025!!

I have a few questions and I was hoping I'd get some answers here.

* My number is 2025EU000 40XXX. Does that mean my odds of actually getting a green card are lower? Is the highest number (lowest odds) 2025EU000 50000?
* What does the timeline look like for entering the United States? 

I'm actually currently in the United States and my OPT expires in July so I'm trying to figure out the best process.

I'm also engaged but my company is okay with me working in my home country. If my odds for obtaining a green card are good this would allow me to continue my employment from my home country while waiting for the green card and then continuing employment in the US afterwards. 

Alternatively, even if were to get married here I would have to stop being employed when my OPT expires and wait for a marriage based green card. Although I'm not getting married for a green card, and would still get married after arriving back in the US, I cannot process a marriage based green card application while in my home country.

immigration,post,1cs6kcb,captdeys,Exporting car to Canada and importing back to USA. Can I do it without getting taxed twice? ,"Hi,

I bought a car in the USA when I was on TN visa. Recently laid off and came back to Canada. I am still looking for work again to move back to the USA but however it is taking time. Don't know when I will go back to the states. I still want to use the car in Canada for the time being until I can move back to the USA.

What advice would you give? Can I keep the car with my USA insurance and drive in Canada? How long can I do that for? Is it worth importing the car to Canada? Would I also need to pay taxes to the province of Canada? If I do import to Canada, would I pay taxes again to the USA and the state when I move back?

I'm planning on doing the same thing later in the year for my car. It's a bit convoluted, but doable. Best guide I've seen is here: [https://kurucz.ca/expatrepat/usa.php#vehicle](https://kurucz.ca/expatrepat/usa.php#vehicle)

Definitely try to import your car if it's in good condition because the car market in Canada is still trash and is expensive from what I've seen. If your car has a salvage or a rebuilt title, don't bother. 

**Check if your car can be imported:** Most cars in the US comply with Canadian standards and regulations, but check [riv.ca](http://riv.ca)

**Get an ITN:** You need to export your car from the US. You'll get an ITN number. You'll need to go through a broker for this one I believe, check the link above. You don't technically have to do this but you'll get into trouble with state/local police if you happen to drive the same car in the US with a Canadian license plate

**Taxes:** There is a ""black book"" that has market value of each car, but it's not open to the public. CBSA determines the value. The first $10,000 of value in your vehicle is tax free if you take the credit, so you pay the taxes on the value of the car minus $10k. You can chose not to take this credit however.",2024-05-15T19:33:55+00:00

[USCIS data here](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/data/eb_i140_i360_i526_performancedata_fy2024_q1.xlsx) says that as of December 2023, EB2 ROW had 26,504 people waiting for visa numbers to become available.

We know that 40,000 EB2 green cards are available per year.  7% of those are going to go to India, and 7% will go to China because they have been backlogged and waiting for years (longer than ROW anyway).  That's 34,400 for ROW, per year.

According to [DHS's 2022 yearbook](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/2023_0818_plcy_yearbook_immigration_statistics_fy2022.pdf), table 7, for EB2, there were 1.002 dependents (spouses+children) for each primary EB2 applicant.  I don't have other data, so let's assume that's uniform across all countries.  This means that for the 26,504 primary applicants mentioned above, 26504\*2.002 = 53,061 green cards are needed.

Assuming the EB2 ROW green cards are issued evenly throughout the year, then 53,061 green cards divided by 34,400 green cards per year = 1.54 years from end of December 2023 = end of June 2025.  That's projection number 1.

The second (simpler) way of looking at it is to observe that it is FY 2024 now, and the Department of State in their recent visa bulletins has said their Final Action Date is unlikely to move forward until the end of this Fiscal Year (with a new year starting in October).  The final action date in [the most recent visa bulletin](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin/2024/visa-bulletin-for-june-2024.html) is January 15 2023.

So where were things at the end of FY 2023?  The [September 2023 (the last of FY 2023)](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin/2023/visa-bulletin-for-september-2023.html) visa bulletin shows July 1 2022.  So during FY 2024, they will have moved from July 2022 to January 2023 - about 6 months.  If FY 2025 (October 2024 - September 2025) shows the same progress, they will end up around July 2023.

Assuming FY 2026 goes the same way (6 months progress in 12 months), we'll get to January 2024.  So being a December 2023 baby, you might have a chance starting in FY 2026... October 2025.  About 1.5 years from now.

So sometime in the second half of next year (2025), you'll probably have your chance.  Fingers crossed that I'm wrong in a good way, because I'm in the same situation as you are in (couple of months earlier).  I would love to believe the other guy saying maybe July and probably October, but I don't see how it can be possible so soon.

immigration,comment,l44mh6n,quixoticsaber,,"For your wife, there’s no problem: she’ll become a permanent resident as soon as she enters on her IR-1, and the return ticket won’t matter at all. 

For your kids, I assume by “getting the passport” you mean that you’re a US citizen, and your kids will become citizens under INA 320 when they are admitted for permanent residence on their IR-2 visas. 

I can see why a return ticket could hypothetically cause a problem: INA 320 only applies if the children are “residing in the United States in the legal and physical custody of the citizen parent pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence”. If you’re here for a brief visit, you’re not residing, and if you have a return ticket presumably you intend to use it?

There’s some discussion on this in [8 FAM 301.10-2(F)](https://fam.state.gov/FAM/08FAM/08FAM030110.html), but it pretty much boils down to “it’s a judgement call”. There’s no bright-line 6 month requirement, but a stay of 6 months or longer would _generally_ qualify as “residing in”. 

That’s probably where what you heard came from. But it’s not the date of a return ticket that matters, it’s your actual place of residence and travel patterns. If you were to arrive, get your kids passports within the first month, and then leave again and return to your prior non-US residence, their citizenship could be questioned when they renew their passports. 

If you intend to settle in the US, then this is all pretty much moot anyway: apply for the passports, don’t use the return ticket and keep hold of some evidence of your US residence in case of questions later. 

The USCIS policy manual also [discusses this](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-12-part-h-chapter-2#S-F), and there’s a nice list of suggested evidence to keep at the end of the page. 

You should also consider applying for Certificates of Citizenship with a N-600 for your kids; they’re expensive, but unlike passports they don’t expire, and in some contexts they’re treated as a stronger claim to citizenship than a passport.",2024-05-15T08:17:18+00:00

immigration,post,1cs2rqj,Crystal345655,I864 income of intending immigrant,"Hello everyone, I’m seeking some advice regarding the Form I-864, Affidavit of Support. According to Page 8, Number 2 of the instructions, if the income of the intending immigrant (who is also the spouse) is included, evidence must be provided that this income will continue from the current source after obtaining lawful permanent resident status.

I’m the spouse in question and I’m facing a challenge. I can provide an employment verification letter from my company that states my salary and start date, but it doesn’t confirm that my income will continue from the current source after obtaining lawful permanent resident status. Is this letter sufficient for submission?

I can also provide paychecks for the last 6 months, tax transcripts for the last 3 years, and W-2s for the last 2 years. However, I don’t have letters of recommendation from supervisors or evidence of promotions or career advancement within my company. Is this acceptable?

My husband doesn’t meet the poverty guidelines, so I’m including my income. But I’m unsure if the documents I have are enough since I don’t have specific evidence that my income will continue from the current source after obtaining lawful permanent resident status.

I need to renew my G4 visa at the US embassy in Ottawa. I am a Canadian citizen and already hold a G4 visa, which is expiring end of this month. I can't renew it in the US because that will take up to 6 weeks and I didn't have a period of 6 weeks in-country due to work travel. I have to now process it in Canada but there's no indication online, through email, or on the phone, about how long this will take.

I wanted to share what happened at my dad's recent immigration appointment for his naturalization civics test, and I could really use some advice.

So, my dad has had eight strokes, and we went to with his doctor to fill out form N-648 to exempt him from the test due to his health condition. Unfortunately, the doctor did not specify and did not fill out correctly to convince immigration officer, and he ended up having to do the civics test.

My dad went in with the immigration officer while I waited in waiting room. Initially, we thought it would just be the civics test, but it turned into a three-hour ordeal. They asked him a ton of questions, not just about civics, but about HIS history in the country and even his finances. It felt more like an interrogation than a standard procedure.

To add to the confusion, at one point, the immigration officer stepped out and started asking me questions. Is that even normal?

I'm just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience or knows if what happened is typical. And if not, what should I do next? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",2024-05-14T20:37:29+00:00

When conducting an N-400 interview, the officer is evaluating your father's entire naturalization application and eligibility, not just Civics/English test.

In order to evaluate eligibility, the officer is authorized to conduct a full review of the applicant's immigration history. If the green card is obtained unlawfully (e.g. lying/fraud) or due to USCIS mistake years before, if there is any criminal records that should have resulted in deportation either before/after the green card is granted, then the officer is required to deny the naturalization and can start deportation proceedings.

Does the EAD have the wording ""Serves as I-512 Advance Parole"" on it?

If it does, she can use that to re-enter the country. 

If not, she can apply for [advance parole](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/travel-documents) from USCIS, based on her pending I-485, and use that to re-enter the country. It'll come on a paper booklet instead of being a notation on her EAD card.

This is probably the safest option, as you can get the document in hand before you leave the US. 

Because she's in L status, which is dual-intent, she should have a couple more options not available to people adjusting status from most other non-immigrant visa categories:

> visa stamp on her passport which has expiration date of Feb 2024 

> We want to travel internationally for less than 30 days. 

To which country?

If it's Canada or Mexico, she may be eligible for [automatic revalidation](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visa-expiration-date/auto-revalidate.html) and able to return on the expired visa.

She was in the U.S. on F-1 visa for grad school, after graduation, she started interning at an international organization using her OPT. Towards the end of her OPT, she was offered a temporary staff position, so she applied for the G4 visa in March 2020. And since it was during the pandemic, traveling was an issue, she mailed her passport to the embassy in Canada for processing, and asked someone to sent it back to her by mail, the G4 visa was issued on 3/27/2020. She didn’t leave the country this whole time. And then in June, she was notified by HR that because she didn’t use her visa to enter the country, her G4 visa wasn’t activated, and she was “unlawfully presented in the U.S.”She quitted the job as soon as she could, but because of the pandemic, she couldn’t get a flight ticket back home. She eventually left on 7/17/2020. Her OPT expired on 5/21/2020, and with the grace period, she should had until 7/21/2020 to leave the country. 

She’s planning on traveling to the U.S. sometime again and was working on the DS160 form, but she wasn’t sure what she should put for the “unlawfully presented or overstay in the US” question. Because if the G4 visa wasn’t activated, does it mean that her F1-OPT was still in effect at the time, and she didn’t overstay?

immigration,post,1cs1d2t,Airport1992,Canadian Travelling to the USA for meetings,"Hello all,

Looking for some advice here. 

My wife works remote for a US non-profit. She works 100% from home from her home office in Canada. She obtained this job through her networking connections. 

The organization just recently got her set up with an EOR/PEO so technically she is an employee of the EOR contracted to the non-profit. 

Previously while the EOR was being set up she was acting as an independent contractor doing management consulting for the organization. She was invoicing the non-profit and withholding applicable taxes. 

About 6 months ago she tried to cross from Canada to US at Detroit for meetings with her team. They grilled her at entry and said her travels were considered work and she needed a visa. They sent her back to Canada. 

Now that the EOR is in place she is supposed to head to a conference in Florida. How can she best prepare for the interactions / questions from the border officers?

Thanks for any insight or help :)

A Canadian is allowed to conduct work for the benefit of their role in Canada, but not to do the work that a US employee would do (like selling to a US customer). 

I've worked cross-border for years, sometimes with a visa, and others travelling as a Canadian employee of a US employer and I have heard many stories like this (one even of a friend who was above-board but didn't know how to answer and so had his Nexus revoked). It's so common that my former employer (blue-chip) used to coach employees about how to address these questions at the border.

While removal cases can be some of the most complicated, they often have clients with very strained finances by design—and that can make finding a niche a little more difficult as far as what you want to do. 

There is a very large shortage of GOOD lawyers and ones that will take on complicated cases and actually handle them well. 

I also think demand for immigration-related litigation is only going to increase—and margins there can be very high. 

Anyway, these are just some random thoughts from observations and experience.

Hello guys, I don’t have much hope to be honest but I’m writing in this Reddit group just to let it out because it’s kinda frustrating. 

I’m a 23 year old and I’m under my parent G4 status. So I can live legally here and I go to college. I applied for a Work permit and a SSN to start working when I have free time from school. And sadly it got denied because they said I’m 23yo. Wanted to know if there are other solutions because it feels like everything is falling apart. Even if I applied for a green card I wouldn’t be eligible because I haven’t lived in the US for 3 and half years between the ages of 5 and 21. 
To be honest, I don’t think there is hope for me because even though I graduate, I don’t even think an employer would sponsor me for a job because it costs a lot. 
I read that going to Canada isn’t bad but don’t know if that’s true. I’ll probably end up returning to my home country, which is home, but I was not expecting it. I know it’s a lot and I should probably see someone that gets payed to find solutions, but I wanted to try Reddit out.

I have an ESTA, a valid UK adult passport, travel insurance, my return ticket booked and a letter of consent for travelling, signed by both of my parents which I'm also considering getting notarised.

I'll have proof that I brought enough money with me too. Is there anything I'm missing?

I was taken to secondary and questioned for an hour, with my phone confiscated and examined too. I was told they were looking for ‘anything lovey dovey’. They didn’t find anything because it was just a friendship until we met in person, but they found it more suspicious I was flying to meet a ‘friend’. They then called my (now) partner to ask him a bunch of questions too, to check his responses.

I was let in with no further problem. On trips to see him after that, when we were in a romantic relationship, I was asked who I was visiting and said ‘my boyfriend’; I got no further questions or problems. Same when we were engaged; ‘visiting my fiancé’ got less scrutiny than ‘visiting my friend’.

If you know that they would find things on your phone making it clear it’s a boyfriend, don’t lie and call them a friend. Although it’s great that you’re prepared and have the documents and evidence you need to show you’ll return home, also be prepared that anyone at anytime can get stopped by CBP; never misrepresent yourself and give false answers. 

You’ll be absolutely fine, just be aware that it may seem like splitting hairs whether you say it’s a romantic relationship or not, to immigration it isn’t and trying to conceal the relationship is a red flag to them.",2024-05-14T22:46:00+00:00

immigration,post,1crugyh,RandomThrowaway7599,USCIS Question ,"So, ima try to cut this story short. I put in my I-129F petition and had it mailed for the 28th of March. Since, I post marked it before the 1st; I used the old I-129F with the $535 fee. On my application, I put the G-1450 form on top and input my AMEX information. Several weeks went by, I kept calling AMEX and one said they saw a pending charge for the USCIS LOCKBOX, cool. Then…a few days later I got a from I-797C stating that the application was rejected because they couldn’t get the payment.

Now, of course, I placed the blame on AMEX and the same day, to be safe, I refilled the I-129F with the new form and paid the new fee, $675 and shipped it out by the end of the day. I was just honestly upset I lost a whole month and some change because they didn’t do nothing so I pushed it aside mentally because this wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for AMEX.

So, where the “dilemma” begins…two days ago I had to buy a plane ticket, and I used my AMEX, something wasn’t right so I ended up calling them and have it fixed. Now when I called they asked which fee did I want to talk about the plane fee or the USCIS fee.  Confused, I was like I want to know more about the USCIS fee since USCIS said you guys rejected. The representative ended up looking through the file or whatnot and came back and said: No, USCIS rejected it cause they had some type of “temp issue”. But he assured me I had the money at the time to pay the fee. 

After the call, I went and chatted with a new representative on the app, just to confirm. They told me the SAME thing. So, with all that context, should I call USCIS and tell them that. Now, I’m honestly not upset about the $675 fee…I already accepted that fate. I’m just more upset that they delayed my process for about a whole month. Because just 2 days go I got my NOA I for the new I-129F that I did. 

I’m mainly looking for advice and opinions on how to go forward with USCIS on this. I called them and the lady said she is going to take it to the higher ups, so I should expect a call back within 30 days. But…if I’m not going to get anything out of this…I don’t want to waste the officer’s time nor mine fighting over something that wouldn’t be resolved. You know what I mean?

Hopefully we stick through our plan to do 185+1 day a year in the US and get her citizenship in three years, but if we decide not to, it literally strands my wife and us citizen daughter out of the country.

The system is broken for families like mine unfortunately",2024-05-14T20:42:07+00:00
immigration,comment,l44nrm7,quixoticsaber,,"Technically, this is only true for A and G category visas, because as a matter of policy, the US government doesn’t accept LPRs as foreign diplomatic agents. 

Consular officers can accept an I-407 when processing those visas, because otherwise they could not be issued. 

> Other nonimmigrant visa categories do not require proof of abandonment of LPR status, so post should adjudicate those cases without requesting an I-407.

[9 FAM 202.2-8](https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM020202.html)

CBP would probably want an I-407 at the port of entry, though. 

In practice, I’m not sure how a post would treat someone who went through all of the work of qualifying for an IV, and then turned around and said “nah fam, gimme a B-1/2 instead”, and I think your suggestion of a denial is quite possible.

immigration,comment,l43jnwv,djao,,"I'm confused. If you are a US citizen and your daughter is a US citizen then your daughter can visit the US together with you. No visa or green card required. It's only if you want to visit the US with mom that complications arise. The immigration system is only designed for the absolute very simplest of cases; any even mild amount of real life complication is more than what immigration is designed to handle.

The road to citizenship is a little longer than three years. You need 3 years minus 90 days of US residence in order to apply; note that you must be living together with your spouse for the entire 3 years and in the same single state for 90 days prior to application. Any single absence of more than 180 days from the US resets your clock. Once you apply, the application itself takes about a year to complete, and for most of that time you need to be in the US. So in total it's more like 4 years.",2024-05-15T02:14:44+00:00

When we inquired what the issue was they said they just wanted us to fill a couple of forms form my father and brother, while the rest of the family was good. They returned our passports.

We filled the forms on the same day, and the last updated date changed twice in march, and then stopped, recently it changed on 9th may, the status is still refused.

We emailed them and they said it can take anywhere between 2 week to 180 days. Has anyone else had any similar experience? 

Can you share how long it took and any additional information. Thanks !!

immigration,post,1crscl6,ThrowRA12596,In-laws want me to sponsor them? Not sure what that means. What is a public charge rule?,"Hi,

So my in law parents want me to be a joint sponsor for their immigration. I personally don't want to do it, but am feeling pressured. My wife is supportive of my decision. My wife is currently finishing up her schooling and wants to sponsor her parents without me. We would separate our taxes (currently joint taxes) and she would make enough to sponsor them under her alone. If she were to sponsor now, I would need to be the joint sponsor because our taxes are combined and I make more money. Her parents are really pushing for this. 

A little background: We live in New York. We have a toddler child too. Her family entered legally, but overstayed. My wife and I got married and it is very genuine. She is amazing and we love and support each other. We didn't even file for green card right away. She wasn't in a rush or anything. Her parents are really pressuring and forcing us. They are older and have some medical issues. They have also visited the emergency room for medical visits and have Obamacare. They also plan to take retirement and benefits like food stamps after getting citizenship. I heard about the public charge rule. Not sure what it is or if it would apply here. 

I brought up our toddler child because we sometimes drop him off at my wife's parents to be watched. Her parents are really holding that against us, kinda blackmailing us - we do so much, we take care of your child, we've helped you financially in the past, you guys drain our energy by leaving your child with us, etc. I worry a lot about our child too. Yesterday night got pretty heated when we went to pick him up. Her parents were screaming and yelling and even threatening us to do it. My wife was yelling too. We left right away, but don't want this to impact the child at all.

Part of me wants to do it to help my wife and get it over with. They've helped me out in the past too financially. Another part of me really does not feel comfortable with it. I worry about the public charge rule, the liabilities, etc. Hoping you guys can provide more info about what it means to sponsor someone. I don't have the best relationship with my in-laws either. I try to help them as much as I can. I even went so far as getting them an apartment under my name, which I regret! They always make me and my wife feel like we don't do enough for them. I get it, they've helped us out in the past, but I feel a joint sponsorship is too much to ask for, especially when there has been abuse and toxic things in the past. They say ""we've been struggling for 15+ years"" I feel bad, but I think - how is that my problem? they've made their own decisions. Don't mean to sound insensitive or anything. At this point I don't want to be connected to them financially or other ways. My wife isn't saying she doesn't want to do it. She just wants them to wait a little longer and they are really rushing her/us.

I'm being indecisive. Heavily leaning towards not wanting to do it. Struggling with how to communicate it and hold that boundary.",2024-05-14T13:37:18+00:00

Sponsorship is legally a very serious commitment. In fact, it famously doesn't even end after divorce and supercedes any alimony payments in the divorce decree. 


You're potentially on the hook to pay all of the immigrants financial expenses until the day they die. If you're ok with that, then go ahead. But in all other cases, think very carefully if this is really what you want to do. Once you sign the document, there is no going back.

immigration,comment,l40ease,rickrollmops,,"This is my nightmare. I don't think there's a good answer, but I'll say this:

* You and your wife may be in great terms now, but god forbid this may change.
* Without knowing you and the future, it is a possibility that her relationship with her parents may eventually contribute to the breakdown of your marriage
* In the meantime, if sponsoring her parents is important to your wife, it should also be important to you that she succeeds in doing so. You have to create a good environment for this to work.

If I were in your situation:
* I would stop relying on her parents for any kind of support. Don't half-ass it ; if you rely on them for childcare then of course they might expect some support in return. So you have to stop doing that otherwise you'll never hear the end of it.
* I would not co-sponsor her parents. If I had that type of heated relationship with them, absolutely zero chance I'd sponsor them.
* I would tell my wife that I will fully support her choices, but that I do not want to have to deal with the parents and don't want to be financially on the hook for them.

Realistically though, elder care in the US is incredibly expensive. At some point it might either dig a hole in your finances (nursing home, ...) or you will have to care for them directly. Think about what this really means in the next decades, and what this will mean for your wife, and whether your marriage can survive this.

Not sure if this is a possibility for you, but would you consider moving to another country with your family for a few years? This might force them to find a solution by themselves. Putting some distance (and an international border) between you can help.

If your wife is going to sponsor them you will still be on the hook. Even while legally it may be her responsibility, it will be your household. You could probably end it by divorce.

If you are the sponsor, you cannot end it by divorce... But otherwise it's the same. As long as you and your wife are together, your finances are commingled.

Your in-laws may not sue you for support. The government may if they are getting public assistance. 

Look into the cost of health insurance for immigrant parents. It is not cheap. At some point they may be eligible for Medicare but they will still have to pay. Then you have to add the possibility of long term care.

immigration,comment,l40ouhv,Upstairs_Version_112,,"Immigration paralegal here. Just my two cents about being a joint sponsor:

1. It is very common for our clients to have a joint sponsor for their green card cases. This is because our clients come from immigrant communities. Their family members and friends are immigrants themselves. Everybody's been through the process. Most of them know what this is about. So they are willing to help. 

2. I only remember these two cases that the joint sponsor was pulled into trouble. Husband and wife got divorced and in a bunch of financial struggle. The immigrating spouse brought up the I864 record to the court. I don't think the joint sponsor was forced to do anything because the judge focused on the US citizen spouse's asset. But it surely was a scary moment for the joint sponsor. The second case is the aging mother got green card from her daughter. The mother became mentally ill. Patent-child relationship deteriorated. Mother  got kicked out and went to the shelter. She occupied the shelter space and wouldn't move. The social services worker went after the daughter and joint sponsor. I don't know how it ended.

I didn't personally handle these two cases. I heard the stories from my coworkers. But you can see the pattern that the joint sponsor only gets into trouble when the immigrant is an ungrateful big jerk, is irresponsible about their financial well-being, is old, is sick, and is likely to rely on government assistance in the near future. 

You know your in-laws the best. Family matters are always hard to cut off. There is not a right or best answer for your situations. You do whatever you feel is the best. Good luck to all of you!",2024-05-14T16:00:08+00:00

I heard about the public charge rule. Not sure what it is or if it would apply here.

Do they *really* have a healthcare? I don't know if NY offers healthcare to illegal aliens, but as far as I know you have to maintain a legal immigration status to have a marketplace healthcare.

Retirement? Did they pay into social security and medicare? Or any kind of investment account (doubt it)? Because if the answer is no to either, they will have to rely on your wife. They sure can use food stamps on their own once they naturalize, but not while they are permanent residents.

The sponsorship you refer to is called *Affidavit of Support I864.* The principal sponsor for the adjustment of status (green card process) should file I864 regardless of the income, and any US citizen or perm resident can be a co-sponsor as well. The income requirement should meet or exceed 125% of the household income set by the federal poverty guideline. This is a contract with the US federal government that you are financially responsible for their living expenses, and any incurring of public mean tested benefits (i,e. food stamp, public housing) will lead to reimbursement from your end. The obligation expires if the beneficiary loses LPR status, die, accrue 40 working quarters, or naturalize.

Public charge rules state that immigrants  cannot use mean tested benefits for the first 5 year of admission, which doesn't seem to apply to your in laws cases.

""we've been struggling for 15+ years"" 

Did they work for 10 years full time and accrue 40 working quarters or more with SSA?

I am on the path of obtaining German citizenship. Would he marrying me as a “German” speed up his process of obtaining German citizenship faster and/or staying longer here?! Or is it better we marry in his country and I take him to Germany to neutralise? 

Many thanks! ",2024-05-14T13:20:53+00:00

immigration,comment,l42gcwh,just-add-caffeine,,"With you being an EU citizen y'all already have the right to family reunification for spouses, once married. The rules are a bit different for spouses of German citizens (no ""income"" requirements, but an additional language requirement) when compared to spouses of EU citizens living in Germany, so that's something to be aware of.

But for naturalization it does not matter if your spouse gained their German residence permit by spousal reunification to you while you were an EU citizen, or after you became a German citizen. Naturalization for your spouse should be possible after 5 years of legal status in Germany, or 3 years with ""special integration efforts"" (currently official websites still describe the status quo until the new StAG law goes into effect on June 27, so I'd recommend checking for details on requirements after that deadline).",2024-05-14T21:59:44+00:00

She's been applying to graduate schools in the US and has been accepted but hasn't chosen a school and thus hasn't started the student visa process. 

The main reasons I'd like to get married is so that we can start the other processes for her to be able to get a part time job in the US while she studies and to make it easier for her to get a job once she's finished.

A few questions I'm hoping someone here can help with. I recognize some might be outside the scope is this sub. 

- If we got married now in this country, how would that affect her student visa application?
- if we got married in the USA, how would that affect her student visa?

immigration,post,1crnzon,MaizeOrganic,"Form I-130, GC, and EAD
","I am currently on a visitor B1/B2 visa, I can go and come back whenever I want to but I can’t get employed.

Normally I’d work under the H1b visa sponsored by the programs I will work at, which isn’t an issue, but not all programs sponsor that. So, If I can get the one you get as a spouse of a US citizen, I can work independently of sponsors and I am basically eligible to apply to every program.



The process for me to get a visa, as my fiance is a US citzen,  is the I-130 form that she needs to file it takes a time to get approved up to like 14 months. Regardless of my visa situation we are planing to get married in july. after the I-130 form, I will file for a green card. I mean if it takes so long by the time that gets approved its no longer of use to me for my work applications.



So, the one option I noticed is that she files for the form I-130 and tries to get an expedited approval. If that happens in time I’ll apply for a green card, and be in the US, and then I’ll file for an employment authorization document (EAD) which allows me to apply to the programs that don’t sponsor visas.

So the main concern is how legally feasible the EAD option is if I should chase that. If I decide to do that I need to do my marriage paperwork asap here. 



the other main concern is I read about how getting a form-130 nullifies your visitor visa. I am not sure if that is true and if it is true, is it just for when you have an application pending or after you get approval, cause if it is after approval it shouldn't be that big of an issue



Side note: If anyone knows any lawyers in turkey that can help that would be very helpful

TLDR: my spouse is a US citizen and I am planning to work in the us in July, is there anyway I can get a visa or employment authorization by then, or do I have to rely on H1b provided by mt work place.

immigration,comment,l40tny2,Givemecardamom,,"Are you currently in the US?    

 Spouse visas usually take 1-2 years. Once you get the visa and enter the US you’re a green card holder and authorized to work, you don’t need to apply for EAD. You’re thinking of the process to adjust status to a marriage based green card within the US (i485 concurrently with i130), with which one can apply for the EAD as well. However, if you’re not currently already in the US, this isn’t an option, as it’s immigration fraud to enter on a tourist visa with the intention of adjusting/staying. Also, if you are in the US and intend to adjust, keep in mind EAD can take 3-6 months, so you may or may not be able to start in July.

Help needed.,"I’m at a stage in my career where I have 5 years of specific marketing experience at a top 10 company. I manage a marketing channel that has grown to over £5 billion in revenue in the last 3 years. So many of the tactics and ideas came from me, I work well with everyone, have a lot of connections, but still my leaders don’t want to sponsor me because apparently it’s challenging for them to switch the location of my role and it’s easier to get a new role.

The teams in the US though are not sponsoring for L1B/L1A visas because they want to recruit Americans. 2 years ago, it wasn’t a problem, but now it is.

My current leaders don’t want to let me go because I am top talent. The US leaders don’t want to wait for 3-4 months on a visa because they need someone quick.

My connections even though they are in high positions have no power to sponsor me because it’s all being controlled by the country leaders and they say no.

I am at a point where my leaders don’t want to let me go, but they can’t do anything about sponsoring me while other leaders I know either don’t have any jobs right now or need someone quick.

I prepared development plans, talked to my team’s leaders for 1 year, and they rejected me after 1 year of wait. Then the VP that rejected me got laid off. Now I’ll have a new leader and start all over again - it’s been a mess.

I wanted to ask for some help on how you navigated getting sponsored through your employer? I have all the development plans, talked to many people even people close to the CEO of this 30K+ people company.

We have a team that helps you get the visa, but the problem is the leaders don’t want to do it even though everyone knows that I have a very special talent managing the biggest marketing channel at my company and personally delivered over £20M in revenue this year only.

But, from my reading of the websites, your employer might actually be right here, if you only have an I-94 with an ADIT stamp.

It's treated as a receipt, not an original document:

https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/form-i-9-related-news/temporary-status-documentation-for-lawful-permanent-residents-lpr

> This document is an acceptable List A receipt for Form I-551, Permanent Resident Card.

https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/form-i-9-resources/handbook-for-employers-m-274/40-completing-section-2-employer-review-and-verification/44-acceptable-receipts

> Accepting a second receipt at the end of the initial receipt validity period is not permissible.

So unless you have a different document--not a receipt--by the end of June, they would need to terminate you. 

Do you have an unrestricted social security card? 

If you do, use that as a List C document, and a drivers license/state ID as a List B document. That combination will not require re-verification. 

If you don't yet have an unrestricted social security card, you should be able to get one from your local Social Security office. (SSA [appear to accept](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0110211025) an ADIT stamp without the ""it's a receipt"" nonsense.)

If you can't do that for some reason, you'll probably need to call USCIS and get an in-person appointment for a new ADIT stamp in your passport, which is treated a [List A document](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/form-i-9-resources/handbook-for-employers-m-274/130-acceptable-documents-for-verifying-employment-authorization-and-identity), not a receipt.",2024-05-14T20:26:30+00:00

immigration,post,1crjpl8,Late-Musician6872,Need of help,"This is kind of long, but I’ll try to make it as short as possible. My mom just got approved of her application for her visa ( form I-485). We got a notice in the mail the other day. Our lawyer said that they were trying to make sure that she didn’t get an interview. But this isn’t the issue. The problem is that’s this is her second time going in for this interview. She lied on her first time , causing her to wait even longer to hear back from immigration again. The only reason why they’re giving her another interview is because I joined the US military. So my question is what types of questions should I prepare myself for my mother as I am her petitioner?

immigration,post,1crjjl2,No_Bat3965,Philippines marriage to US citizen -- do we need a Philippines transcription of the foreign marriage,"Hi,

I am trying to be a bit proactive with the immigration situation. My Filipino wife and I got married outside the Philippines. When we got married we fulfilled all of the local conditions. However, we never recorded the marriage with the Philippines government. 

In the visa reciprocity table, it says 

> For marriages that occurred outside of the Philippines, the original marriage certificate from the issuing country should be provided, and translated into English, along with the Philippines recording of the marriage.

https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/Visa-Reciprocity-and-Civil-Documents-by-Country/Philippines.html

Also, I saw this

https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/Supplements/Supplements_by_Post/MNL-Manila.html

> A Certificate of No Marriage (CENOMAR) from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) valid within one (1) year from the date it was obtained. The U.S. Embassy in Manila requires a CENOMAR for applicants whose unmarried status is important to their visa category.

However, my wife will not be going through Manila because she is not a resident there. Like many Filipinos she lives overseas. We also didn't need a CENOMAR when we got married because the country we got married in doesn't require that.",2024-05-14T04:24:54+00:00

immigration,post,1crio12,Mediocre-Hawk-6326,HOT TAKE: No Sympathy for Pregnancy During Immigration,"Every week we see versions of the same post: “I’m pregnant, how can I get my immigrant fiancé/husband here for the birth and then have him stay after?” or “Just found out my immigrant fiancée/wife is pregnant, how do I get her here ASAP?” Usually there’s a sense of incredulity (at best) or indignation (at worst) when the OP hears that the only possible legal channels are time-consuming and that it takes longer to resolve immigration cases than the gestational length of a human pregnancy, and that pregnancy is overwhelmingly not a reason to expedite. 

I understand that accidents/mistakes happen, but if you’re in the midst of immigration proceedings (or thinking about starting them), AND if care about having your significant other here for the birth and infancy (or having them give birth here), THEN WAIT FOR PREGNANCY. There are so, so, so many options for pregnancy prevention and family planning — but I swear sometimes on this sub it seems like birth control hasn’t been invented. If you’re not willing to wait, then don’t be surprised when you’re a single parent (or your SO is a single parent) throughout pregnancy and for months/years while you wait for clarity on your case. This is very difficult, especially because babies are so physically demanding, but it’s still possible (babies are born to single parents, while their parents are deployed, etc.) But ultimately you don’t get to have it both ways; you have to take the bad with the good. This is the reality of being involved with the immigration system.

Plenty of people are delaying their lives and family planning for immigration purposes; the people who act like they deserve to skip the line because someone didn’t wear a condom are unbelievably frustrating to me. If you can’t do enough research to delay pregnancy, or at least make the decision to proceed with your eyes wide open about what pregnancy means for your immigration case, you really have no business being a parent anyway.

Did she get a re-entry permit before leaving the US? If so, she should be fine and shouldn't face extra scrutiny. Those are good for up to two years. 


If she didn't, she'll need to convince the CPB officers that she didn't intentionally abandon her US residence. If it hasn't been much more than a year, there's a solid chance (but no guarantee) that she won't face any extra questioning. Especially if you, as her husband, have been living in the US the whole time. If her English is very poor, it might help if she can travel with someone who's fluent, or she can request a translator. If she does face extra scrutiny? Having a copy of her medical records will help.  Having correct documentation for the babies will help. Your presence will help. Evidence that you've maintained a residence for the both of you in the US while she's been abroad will help. 


Most of all, she should not sign a document saying she's abandoning her green card. Border control does not have the authority to remove a green card without the green card holder's consent, so at worse, your wife would have a few uncomfortable hours of questioning and eventually an appointment before a judge to argue why she didn't abandon her green card. But again, with only a little more than a year outside the country and evidence that she hasn't intentionally abandoned her green card, she's likely fine. ",2024-05-14T21:27:02+00:00

Because you do NOt qualify.  It may seem weird, but there are some visas that do not directly lead to a green card no matter how long you have been here. 

You would have been eligible if your father obtained a green card during his stay here. Doesn't matter if you never broke the law.

immigration,post,1crfm4t,Historical_Knee_1166,Seeking Advice on Visiting the US for Networking and Remote Work,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some advice on an upcoming trip to the US and how best to handle my situation with Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Here’s my background:

* **Purpose of Visit**: I plan to visit friends I met during my last trip to Miami. In addition, I want to network for my job and startup.
* **Last Visit:** This last visit was 10 month ago, and I stayed for 4 month. I was planning to stay only for one but I really liked Miami so I end up meeting a lot of people and staying for longer.
* **Employment**: I work as a client partner for a Uruguayan company, and I have a remote job as a software developer for another Uruguayan company. I also have my own startup and aim to network with other startup CEOs and venture capitalists while in the US.
* **Networking Goals**: I intend to establish connections and seek potential clients for my Uruguayan company, as well as seek advice and potential partnerships for my startup.

I’m aware that I need to be clear and truthful about my intentions when talking to CBP officers. Here’s how I plan to explain my situation:

""I am visiting friends I met during my last trip to Miami. Additionally, I work as a client partner for a Uruguayan company and plan to network and establish connections to seek potential clients in the US. I also have a startup and aim to network with other startup CEOs and venture capitalists to seek advice and potential partnerships. While in the US, I will continue my remote work as a software developer for a Uruguayan company. I will not be working for any US-based companies or clients.""

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Any advice on how to handle this with CBP or any potential pitfalls to avoid? I want to make sure I’m fully prepared and compliant with US regulations.

Thanks in advance for your help!",2024-05-14T00:57:52+00:00

immigration,comment,l3zaaxf,FeatherlyFly,,"Among other things, CPB look for a pattern of visits that make it seem like you're trying to live in the US or that you're working while in the US. Four months one time is a little suspicious, not a lot of young people can afford to take that much time off work and working remotely isn't allowed. But taken alone, a single four month visit isn't going to get you banned.


However, the more really long trips you take, the more it looks like you're trying to live in the US or that you must be working in the US to support yourself. 


The rule of thumb is spend 1-2 months out of the country for each month in. If you left 10 months ago, then you're probably fine for a short visit. If you arrived 10 months ago and left 6, it's more likely you'll be questioned, even for a short visit. And either way, spending first four months and then two months in the US is going to raise questions about how you can afford it, given that remote work is not allowed, even for a non US employer. And given that the honest answer to ""how do you plan to pay for this visit?"" is ""I'll be working without the legal right to do so,"" it's a bad idea.

I've been a permanent resident since Sep 2021, been traveling home back and forth for winter and summer breaks while I was in the Uni. I made sure to keep the trips shorter than 6 months, and be physically present in the US for more than 6 months during a year in total.  
Right now I'm thinking about obtaining a Re Entry Permit to back home and maybe work there for a year or so, because it will be easier to get a job there than in the US. Of course I will be paying taxes and remain my bank accounts/credit cards active, while overseas.  
If I leave in Sep 2024 and come back in Sep 2025, by the time the Sep 2026 comes I will be present in the US for more than 2.5 years over the 5 year period.  
So the question is, if I apply for the permit, leave the US in Sep 2024 and comeback in Sep 2025, will my continuous presence break and I will have to wait until Sep 2030, instead of Sep 2026, to apply for the citizenship?

Truly, supporting documents bolster a particular factual claim
by definition— they are supporting documents.

The Officer apparently believed supporting documentation is a requirement based upon a copied and pasted quote from BIA precedent that quite frankly is not relevant to the legal issues in this case and actually contains a typo that both changes the meaning of the quote and also explains the Officer's misguided approach. The following is a direct quote from the Decision on page 2 following the Officer's summary and analysis of the Applicant's testimony:
Simply going on record, or testifying, without supporting documents is not sufficient ot meet the burden of proof ni immigration proceedings. See Matter of Soffici, 2 I&N Dec. 158, 165 (Comm'r 1998) referring to Mater of Treasure Craft of California, 14 I&N Dec. 190 (Reg. Comm. 1972).

Simply going on record without supporting documentary evidence is not sufficient for purposes of meeting the burden of proof in these proceedings. See Matter of Treasure Craft of California, 14 1&N Dec. 190 (Reg. Comm. 1972).
SOFFICI and TREASURE CRAFT OF CALIFORNIA are both cases dealing with investor and business visa matters where the aliens sought to demonstrate financial- and investment-related requirements for those visas based upon uncorroborated testimony alone and both are attached to this Motion to Reconsider as Exhibits (Exhibits 4 and 5). Therefore, not only does the correct quote plainly refer the ""these"" proceedings, i.e., the proceedings in Matter of Soffici, but even a broader reading of ""these"" reasonably limits this statement to investor and business cases.

immigration,post,1crdzfv,cuevadanos,Some specific questions about the Diversity Visa lottery,"I am interested in the lottery and I have a few questions I haven’t found the answers to.

1. The education requirements say that primary applicants must have completed 12 years of education/a high school equivalent. The assumption is that the mandatory time period of schooling in the US is 12 years.

- What happens if an applicant has completed mandatory education in their country, but it is less than 12 years? (I assume they wouldn’t be eligible, but I want to be sure)

- In my country, mandatory schooling takes 10 years. People can then do two more years of schooling. People can also do vocational training, and 4 years of vocational training are legally equivalent to 2 years of extra schooling. Would a person with the 10 years of mandatory schooling + 4 years of vocational training meet the education requirement?

2. What does the US call people who work in HR and manage payroll, filing taxes, etc? I believe that’s not accountant work, but is there a specific job title? (I need to know in order to check if it’s an eligible occupation)

3. Which are the mental health conditions that may cause a visa to be refused? Is the US strict on this regard (and even a person with mild anxiety may get denied) or is refusal limited to people with crimes or a history of violent behaviour?

4. How likely is a visa to be granted if one adult person in the household does not speak any English at all?",2024-05-13T23:38:42+00:00
immigration,comment,l3xf9o2,not_an_immi_lawyer,,"1. If the country requires mandatory education less than US high school equivalent, and that's all the applicant has completed, then the applicant is not eligible under the 12 year/US high school equivalent route.

2. No, if the 4 years of vocational training don't meet US high school standards (i.e. covering general education like language, sciences - physics/biology/chemistry, social studies and math), it does not meet the education requirement. You would have to meet the work experience requirement instead.

3. Payroll and Timekeeping Clerks, which unfortunately do not qualify for DV: https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/43-3051.00

4. Not strict, generally only mental health conditions that will potentially cause harm to themselves/others or cause them to need institutionalization will be a problem.

5. Not a problem.",2024-05-13T23:50:43+00:00

They will not be able to invoke the protection of the US for anything regarding those properties. They will have to manifest this explicitly within 6 months after the renunciation is done. Every foreigner that owns property in Mexico has to accept this (article 27(I) of the constitution) anyway. If they don't do this manifest their properties will be confiscated by the government. Also if they own property in the forbidden zone (100 km from borders and 50 km from the coast) they will have to sell it, donate it or do whatever they want with it as long as they transfer ownership, within 2 years.

To complement this information, this would apply immediately after renunciation for new purchases of property; if they already own property anywhere they have to manifest within 6 months that they accept being considered as Mexicans for every purpose regarding that property (i.e. renouncing any right to invoke the protection of a foreign government about anything related to the property) and if they own property in the forbidden zone they have 2 years to dispose of it.

This is not correct. The constitution forbids the government from depriving anyone that is a Mexican citizen by birth. There's a big difference between the government taking away your citizenship and you voluntarily relinquishing it. Anyone can renounce it whenever they want as long as this does not result in statelessness, as one of the requirements is to show a birth certificate or naturalization letter from another country.

immigration,post,1crcvua,ServeLivid7225,Given 5 years ban at the border entry,"Hey everyone,

I’m hoping to get some advice here, so bear with me as this is a bit of a long story. I got hit with a 5-year ban at the U.S. border because the officer thought I was trying to reunite with my ex-wife and get a job through her. Just to give some context, I was on a B1/B2 5-year visit visa, and this was my first time visiting the U.S. since my divorce.

So, here's the backstory: I got married to a U.S. citizen, and we initially planned to go through the spouse visa process. But unfortunately, things went south we decided to get divorced. For reference, we weren’t even married for a year, though we dated for over three years before deciding to tie the knot, hoping to be together.

We finalized our divorce and went our separate ways. Though we were apart, we still had each other’s numbers and stayed in touch occasionally.

Fast forward to me deciding to give the U.S. visit visa a try, and I got it. In our conversations, I mentioned to her that I got the visa and was planning a trip to the U.S. This led to us talking more, and she kept suggesting ways for me to stay in the country, even send me U.S. job applications. On the day I was supposed to fly to the U.S, she offered to pick me up from the airport, and I didn’t see any harm in that since I thought we were still good friends despite the divorce.

But things went south at the border. The immigration officer questioned me hard about my visit, took my phone, and saw our conversations. It ended with me getting deported and slapped with a 5-year U.S. ban. This whole experience was a massive blow to my mental health. I got seriously depressed.

I haven’t fully recovered from the depression caused by all this. Every time I think about how it all went down, I get really sad. I’m trying to rebuild my life, but I can’t help feeling down about the whole situation.

My experience at the U.S. border was traumatic; I even spent a night in a holding cell before being sent back.

I’m slowly getting my life back on track, but I really want to overturn the 5-year ban and don’t even know where to start. I’m also considering applying for a Canada PR visa or even trying the visit visa again, but having this ban hanging over me is really affecting me.

immigration,comment,l3ye02d,Merisielu,,"Here’s my experience:

I went through the London embassy in February for my interview:

Super easy process. It’ll be over in minutes and, in my experience, it was the most simple questions.

In fact, I was surprised with how basic the questions I got were!!

I got to the embassy at 8am. My interview time was 8:30 and the queue already for security was HUGE. You check in at the little podium at the front, and they let you join the queue when there’s 30 mins or less before your appointment.

The security staff were very friendly (literally cracking jokes). I think they appreciate that people are quite on edge. It took 20 minutes to clear the airport-style security.

I went upstairs to where the interviews are. The immigrant visa area was very busy, but the K1 interviews are around the corner and there were only 4 people in that waiting area.

It’s like a bank with multiple windows. You are given a number and go to the window when your number appears on the screen.

The first window is to check documentation. They take your birth certificate, passport, the passport-style photographs, etc. A couple of questions there (mainly name, what visa you’re doing, etc.) and then you sit back down. Again though, I had a really nice and kind person deal with me there.

Then you’re called forward again for the actual interview. You have to raise your hand and swear an oath before answering. Then the questions were:

•You are engaged to a US citizen, correct? And you intend to get married?

•And how did you two meet? What app?

•When did you first meet in person?

•And, I presume, there’s been other meetings since then?

•He’s visited you in the UK?

•Where does your fiancé live in the US?

•You intend to get married there and live there?

•What is his profession?

•We gave you a leaflet at the first window*. Have you read it? Do you have any questions from that?

•Have you had your medical, as I’m missing the report.

And that was enough for him to say he considered my relationship entirely legitimate and my intent to be appropriate for the visa.

The interviews are done at windows like a bank, so you can hear what other people are saying. The guy before me got almost the exact same questions. He was grilled a little more because he made the story about them meeting sound super complicated. The agent questioning him was unsure whether he was taking about virtual reality meetings or in person, so he got more follow-up questions than I did. Basically, the more simple your answers are, the less problem they have.

I took a bunch of extra evidence (photos, invoices for wedding stuff in both names) and didn’t need any of it. Just handed over the required ID, police certificate, and copy of the financial affidavit/my fiancé’s tax return.

*The leaflet is one required by international marriage brokerage law and details how the rest of the K1 works (having to marry within 90 days, etc.) and also the definitions of domestic abuse and how to get help for it.

It really was that straightforward!",2024-05-14T03:53:31+00:00

immigration,post,1cr7ub1,AromaticAd9491,Divorce while waiting for green card,"I am a US Citizen who got married to an illegal immigrant from Guatemala who came to the US on a tourist Visa in 2015 and overstayed his Visa. We met in 2021 and got married in 2022, however, things have gone awry since the day I got married to him and he started physical, mental, and emotional abuse. However, I never called the police because I was afraid that he'd be deported. However earlier this year, we got into a heated argument and he got physical to the point where he ripped my clothes, beat me, and choked me where I blacked out. I moved out that night to my parent's house and brought all my stuff with me the next day. I still wanted him to get his paperwork so I didn't file for a divorce right away. However, with the passing months, it became clear to me that he didn't want me to be with him and only wanted to get his paperwork. Last week I informed him that I was moving forward with the divorce and he got upset and told me ""You can't divorce a corpse, and you'll be a widow before you can get a divorce"" and then crashed his car into an embankment. I went this morning, filled out the divorce paperwork, and gave it to a state Marshal to serve him. My question is what happens to the immigration process now that I have taken this step? Is there still a chance for him to get his green card? Do I have any options even though I didn't call the police during our altercations and the only proof that I have of what he did is in text messages?",2024-05-13T19:20:56+00:00

I have the following situation and I am not sure if I should accept the offer in one the BigTech firms

* My PERM for my present role at my current company has been approved in the year 2020.
* Consequently, the I-140 associated with this PERM for my current position at my current firm has also been approved. 
* The BigTech firm that has offered me a position currently put a filing freeze on all PERM applications until 2025.
* Could someone please advise if it's legally possible to transfer both my PERM & I-140 to the BigTech firm for the potential position that they are offering me without forfeiting my existing priority date and I-140, taking into account their prevailing policies concerning PERM and I-140 submissions?

(My job profile & designation at my current firm and the BigTech firm are almost similar so that is not an issue)

I would really appreciate your help in figuring out if I should be accepting the offer. Validity of my current I-140, my priority date and my ability to extend my H1B status on the basis of an approved I-140 is paramount in taking a decision.",2024-05-13T18:51:45+00:00
immigration,comment,l3w5wel,not_an_immi_lawyer,,"Are you born in India/China?

No, it's not possible to transfer your PERM/I-140 over to the new company. Your new company must restart the PERM process from scratch.

However, you can preserve old your priority date once the new company's PERM and I-140 are approved.

Additionally, you can extend your H-1B (if you're India/China-born) based on a previous employer's I-140, as long as it is not withdrawn within 180 days of approval.

If you're India-born in particular, there's no point filing PERM/I-140 with a company until your priority date will be imminently current, which will take decades.",2024-05-13T19:15:45+00:00

Hi yall, some days ago I received a letter from the ICE that says I need to be enrolled in a program called YACMP which is designed to assist the cases of people of 18-19 years of age to comply with their immigration obligations.

It also says that I need to contact a YACMP office to schedule my first appointment by a specific date, problem is that I don't know how to contact them and there isn't enough info on the letter nor online that I can find besides general info about the YACMP and what they do.

It does say the direction of the place that I need to go for the appointment but I don't know if I have to go in person to schedule the appointment and I don't wanna mess this up because I feel like immigration matters are really important for me to get right so I don't get any kind of sanctions, maybe I'm exaggerating 

I also can't find any info from ICE about it, I called to the available numbers and still nothing, nor there is any subreddit or discord for ICE info or YACMP info so I came here to ask, I'm not really sure if this is the right place to ask but if anyone can give me an answer on how do I contact them or what exactly is the YACMP, I'm all eyes and I'm sorry if any details are confusing, I'm kinda nervous about this whole thing for some reason.

# Immigration/Divorce Ethiopia

Hello,

I was married in 2019 to an Ethiopian who I brought with the K1 visa. After the 6 month period I was hesitant about filling out the Marriage Certification. But with his threats I went to the courthouse and did that. During this time I was in and out of the hospital due to my illness (later found out it wasnt just anxiety). My parents took me to Ethiopia during this time-for holy water,therapy,etc. While I was doing this- my ""husband"" filled out the adjustment of status on his own and had a lawyer help him. He filled out all of the forms without my consent. Later I came to realize that he was living with another women while I was in the hospital and away. I had called many times to see how he was because I still had feelings and did not know his intentions. In 2021 He called my mother and I to appear for the immigration appoitment-mind you this is while he was living with the women and I did not know what was going on.... He showed us a statement that the lawyer had drafted stating that he couldnt be with me because I was going through ""mental issues"" so during the immigration appointment- I was not asked to participate. They took him in with his lawyer-when they got out-they said that they said that they officer was questioning him too much and they believed that he did not receive his papers.

I found out about the relationship a year after the interview. I found out that he filled on his own, he was filling taxes and used email that I did not give consent to use....Still now I am not able to finish the divorce process.I have told USCIS the story multiple of times but I fell as though they do not care.

What is my legal right? Spoke to some lawyers and they said that he doesn't want ot file for a divorce because it would make his case look bad.

I have started the divorce process. Is there anything I am legally entitled to?? Can I make him pay for therapy? emotional abuse? Also, I dont have proof but during my stay in Ethiopia he used to abuse me...all type of ways...

immigration,post,1cqzf2c,No_Tomorrow_3057,Advice on moving to the US as a Brit ,"Tl;Dr what jobs can I get with an English and Spanish degree that would mean US employers would want to hire me. 

Hello, I'm a British student currently doing my Alevels and plan on going to uni in September, doing a 4 year course in  an English and Spanish joint Bachelor's degree. 

I know having a bachelor's significantly improves my chances of immigrating as it opens up job opportunities. My worry is that compared to the sciences, careers with an English degree aren't in demand.

The field I want to work in is localisation and I'm thinking that maybe somewhere in film or publishing  could be an entry point after getting a ton of experience in the UK. At the same time though, my research on localisation jobs has made me realise it's a very freelance and remote type of job meaning there wouldn't be much incentive for employers to sort my immigration visas out when they could just have me working remotely. 

The other field I'm thinking is education but I think it's very very unlikely for a high school to apply for my visa. Maybe a university though but then again highschool teaching seems a lot more appealing to me. 

There's also journalism which I actually think may be a good option but then again the type of journalism I'm interested in is stuff like culture magazines ie music gaming film etc which also tend to be freelance and remote.

The other option I'm aware of is marriage and it's too early for me to tell if that's a viable option. Who knows what will happen in the time it takes me to fund immigration costs and gaining experience. Also something about the fact that I may be marrying rather than just living with someone purely for a visa seems a bit exploitative to me and I don't really stand with that. 

So what jobs do you think I could get into with my prospective English and Spanish degree that would actually have chances of an employer wanting to hire me? I'm open to anything honestly as I can always go back to my ideal career of localisation and teaching.

 As i speak multiple languages, they are more like just bonus.

let's say you are in medical related job and speaking other language, that would make you much valuable for your employer. But when your main skill is only on language? That's is not much valuable for them, in the end they want someone who are familiar with their industry.

immigration,post,1cqx78x,ConsiderationOne3465,Looking for guidance on spouse immigration from Iraq ,"Hello everyone. I’m newly married to my Iraqi husband and I’m preparing to file for his immigration. I’m getting extremely apprehensive, though. Many people keep telling us we need an attorney but everywhere I look it seems like I may be able to do it myself. I received a quote from one attorney for 5k, and that was just for the I-130 and I-485 (not including filing fees). 

I’m wondering if filing for a spouse immigration visa is more complex for an Iraqi than for someone from another country. 

For context, I work in Iraq and we met here. We don’t technically live together 100% of the time because he has a home outside of the base where I work (I’m not permitted to leave the base). We will be asking for a shared room soon so that will be an added piece of evidence. 

I have our chats in a pdf format, as well as photos. I’m also getting affidavits from 5 people so far. I’m also getting certified translations of our necessary documents. If anyone can provide any guidance I would greatly appreciate it. ",2024-05-13T11:41:53+00:00

A lawyer can't add anything extra and I am glad to answer any questions. My husband came here in 2019 after we did a spouse visa on our own, and we did the removal of conditions and his citizenship paperwork and saved every single piece of paper. Will you be staying in Iraq during the duration of the visa process (18-24 months most likely)? Will your job continue upon your return to the US?

I'm in a difficult situation and I'm looking for advice on possibly returning to the U.S., knowing this might be a long shot.

Here's a brief overview of my background:

I lived in the U.S. for several years, obtaining a Green Card during that time.

My parents separated when I was young, and I was moved back to another country without my input. Since then, I've lived in various countries, completing my education abroad. (Now in my mid-20s)

My sibling and one parent are U.S. citizens (one by birth and the other through naturalization).

An attempt was made to secure a U.S. passport for me some years ago, but it failed due to my other parent not signing the required documents. I still don't understand why I couldn't apply for a passport later, as the consulate also refused my application a few years ago.

I've always wanted to return to the U.S. but didn't have a clear path before turning 21 and didn't want to interrupt my studies. During a family visit to the U.S. a few years back, I entered with a Green Card while traveling with my family. An immigration agent allowed us entry after questioning, but we couldn't follow through with our plans to return permanently.

A few years ago, I tried applying for a U.S. passport, but the consulate said I wasn’t eligible.

My plan to enter the U.S.:

Recently, I got my expired Green Card back. I'm thinking about trying to re-enter the U.S. with it and an I-90 form showing I'm renewing it, pleading my case at the border. I'm also considering bringing my U.S. citizen parent to help show ongoing ties during what could be a tough inspection process. I also have emails that could justify my visit to the embassy a few years ago.

I know using my expired Green Card to re-enter is risky, but I feel mostly American and want to return to what I consider home.

Would it be a bad idea to try entering with the expired Green Card and the I-90 petition? If this fails, could it affect my chances of getting a student visa later?

Thank you so much for your help!

Being forced to leave the U.S. has been very frustrating, and I apologize if any emotions came through in my message. I've done my best to keep it factual, but I've been unsure how to proceed.

P.S. I'm aware of the SB-1 visa, but it seems unlikely from what I've read. I have a consultation with a lawyer about it but am not sure it's worth it.",2024-05-13T11:04:12+00:00

1) apply to renew green card.  Get your father to send you the i797 receipt.

Even if /u/purplemangolatte is OK with this, I wonder how that plays out in practice.

If I understand correctly (and I might not), then after being admitted on his expired I-551, OP would still be considered a permanent resident if and until an immigration judge rules otherwise.

So, technically, there shouldn't be an issue with gainful employment in the US. There might even be an option to temporarily leave for travel, but I am vague on the details and this could be pushing OP's luck. Would only consider doing so after having a long conversation with a lawyer.

But the elephant in the room is that OP doesn't currently hold an unexpired green card (i.e. the actual physical card). Most employers would insist on seeing one. Can OP get an I-551 stamp or renew the card while waiting for the immigration judge?

This is what I found.

https://fam.state.gov/fam/08fam/08fam030110.html#M301_10_2_F

Each case must be considered on its own merits.  In general, the longer the duration of the stay (see 8 FAM 301.10-2(F)(2)), the less need there is to analyze the character of the stay.

b. In some cases, a stay of a short duration will, because of its character, meet the “is residing in” requirement. For example, a child who attends boarding school abroad but spends time in the United States in the legal and physical custody of the citizen parent residing in the United States generally would be considered to be residing in the United States for purposes of INA 320.

c.  Similarly, a child whose parents have joint custody but who reside apart and who stays with each parent would be considered to reside with both parents and, assuming at least one U.S. citizen parent lives in the United States, the child would meet the “is residing in” requirement by staying with that parent.


d. Analyzing the character of the stay may also include analyzing the character of any departures from the United States.  For example, a week-long visit to a foreign country for purposes of tourism would not mean that the applicant is no longer residing in the United States.  You should apply the same criteria to determine whether the applicant is, in fact, residing overseas during the departure.

Section c is the one that you should look at - your parents had joint custody in both countries.",2024-05-13T15:46:41+00:00

I need to figure out how to start, but we live in Florida. My mother has been living in the US since I think about 1986 and came here from Nicaragua due to the Contra Wars at the time. Her green card expired around the time when Trump was elected president, and her attorney advised her to wait until things calmed down because things got crazy after his election. Before this, she was able to renew her docs on time without issue. She always worked and paid her taxes on time and has had good moral character throughout her time here in the US.  She has my 94-year-old grandmother to care for and now my aunt (both naturalized citizens). My aunt had a stroke over a year ago, and ever since, my mom has been her primary caretaker. So, my mom still works as a cleaning lady and is the primary caretaker for her adopted mother and her sister.  She has her whole family here, including them and my sisters, me, and now her new grandson.  She has seen immigration attorneys, and IDK why nothing has been done; the previous one had back surgery and was very ill, and that was the last time she had an attorney. I know we have to look into a new immigration attorney, but I wanted to know what suggestions anyone has. I know now there is  TPS for Nicaragua, and she did get a new ID from the Nicaraguan consulate. But now she is of retiring age, and she wants to retire and get back what she can get from SS benefit since she has paid her taxes every year since she has worked in this country.

As far as the law is concerned, illegal immigrants cannot receive social security benefits, even if they've paid their taxes. If your mother is planning to retire soon and expects to receive SS benefits, you should double check her paperwork. In addition, illegal immigrants are not eligible for other important retirement benefits, like Medicare.

There may be ways to get her a green card (assuming that you are a US citizen) and correct her social security record. If she has been using a fake SSN, the SS taxes from her wages would have gone into the earnings suspense file. If she becomes a legal immigrant, she can get a real SSN, and her taxes paid will need to be reinstated to her new SSN.

We are both citizens of those countries and reside in them. We love each other very much, but if the K1 visa journey doesn't work out, I may have to say goodbye.

The reason I think she may be rejected for the K1 visa is due to her family's business. Times are tough in the Philippines, and her family has been operating the business without paying for a business permit for the past few years. My girlfriend has been working in the business off and on consistently to provide miscellaneous help when needed. Their business is a small business but larger than something very small like a market stand.

I don't want to go through the long K1 visa journey just for her to be looked into and rejected around the time of the visa interview. 

I am also wondering how much the law enforcement of the Philippines would do if they discovered this business. I suspect there could be other fraud that follows like tax fraud due to the business not even having a permit to begin with.

immigration,post,1cqmxdz,Ok-Explanation-6537,What pathway can me and my fiancé take to be and live together?,"We are both international students in Canada but she is a permanent resident in US (recent). What pathway can we take so we can be and live together? 

We are ok with staying in Canada or going to US, whichever pathway is best feasible.

Here are the facts for now:
- We are not married but we intend to after graduation.
- I will hopefully have a return offer in a very reputable company here in Canada soon after graduation so I would prefer to build some experience with them and then I’d like to request a transfer/relocate to US.
- Career is important to me, so I’m afraid that if I get married and request to move to US with an H1B, because getting the green card can take a while, I’ll be denied H1B because my spouse is a green card holder. (I heard it from quite a lot of people but I don’t even know if this is true)

Some potential pathways:
- I earn my citizenship here in Canada and she does so in US after graduation however this will require a few years of LDR.
- We get married after graduation. She goes back to US and I continue to build experience here (with PGWP). We start my green card process and when I get it, I request to transfer to US which shouldn’t be too much of an hassle because I would be a green card holder.

What are some pathways that we should consider? We are open to suggestions!",2024-05-13T01:00:40+00:00

immigration,post,1cqk8oa,Gaddawy,Seeking Advice on Family Sponsorship via US and Canadian Citizenship,"
Hi everyone,

I'm looking for some guidance regarding family sponsorship through both US and Canadian immigration systems. My uncle has been a US citizen for about 5 years, and I'm wondering if it's possible for him to sponsor my mother. If he can sponsor her, could she then sponsor me once she becomes a US citizen?

Additionally, my uncle has also been a Canadian citizen for over 15 years. Could he potentially sponsor my father through the Canadian immigration system? And following that, is there a possibility for my father to sponsor me?

If anyone has gone through a similar situation or has knowledge about this route, your advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!",2024-05-12T22:46:05+00:00

In other words, the fastest you can get a US green card through your uncle is around 30 years.

Your foreign medical experience is not given any consideration.

immigration,comment,l3rsj4w,not_an_immi_lawyer,,"No visa is available for a refrigeration apprentice.

Canadian citizens/permanent residents require a work permit/visa to work in the US, just like any other foreign national.

The key benefit Canadians get is the TN visa: you qualify for this visa if your occupation is on the TN visa list (generally: nurses, doctors, scientists, and other degree-holding professions) and generally a bachelor degree (a very small number of professions only require post-secondary certifications and those are heavily scrutinized).

If you want to move to the US, your best bet is to change professions and get a degree for a TN visa profession:

immigration,post,1cqjdsp,SaltyOnion1,Try to save or ditch Green Card?,"I'm (22) a foreign born Canadian Citizen who obtained US permanent residence through my dad when I was a child, who received it through work. We then moved from the US to another country (not Canada) when I was 9.  
  
In the span of a few years, my dad had his residency status canceled at the border on his second US visit, he also had no intention of trying to save it. I visited the US once for a few months when I was still a child and they didn't give me any trouble. But now its been quite a few more years and my card is expired too.

  
I am now older and living in Canada. I'd like to move to the US when I finish my undergrad, mostly for job opportunities. Is there any series of steps I can take to salvage my residency status? If I can, I fully intend to move to the US and not leave until I get full citizenship.  
  
I have some family in the States, and a SSN, but besides that I do not have any other real connections. I also haven't paid US taxes on my Canadian income all these years. I'm hoping I can secure a full time job in the US and have that be enough to move there, where I can then renew my green card. Is this possible and realistic, or am I out of luck? Maybe I could throw my dad under the bus and say I never had a choice to leave the US when I did. Could a border official cancel my permanent residence and then reject me from entering the States because I'm moving for work without a TN or H1-B?

  
I'd like to know, because if saving my residency status isn't possible, then I think my best move would be to file  a I-407 now and cancel it now. Then hopefully I can secure a US internship on a J-1 which will later help finding full time work in the US. It would also be nice being able to drive down to the states casually without having to worry about losing my Green Card.

  
Lastly, if I do file a I-407, will I be subject to an exit tax? I haven't filed my US taxes as of yet on my Canadian income. I'm not sure what the implications of that could be.

I think you should try to keep your GC if possible.

You can find an immigration lawyer for a consultation. The lawyer will advise you about your chances of being able to re-enter and renew your GC, which airports are the most likely to allow you to re-enter with an expired GC, whether you should file back taxes, etc. Also, even if you re-enter the US as a permanent resident, your long absence may cause issues when you try to renew your GC or naturalize.",2024-05-13T00:56:25+00:00

If she lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years,   at least 5 of which were after age 14, then your mother is a citizen.

It also seems that your maternal grandfather was a citizen at his birth, so maybe your mother has 2 US citizen parents (then her mother does not need to meet the 10/5 residence requirement).

On this subreddit, I have helped 1 kid get his US passport after being scoffed at by a lawyer who did not know the derivative citizenship law.  His case was straightforward - he had a younger sibling with CRBA and a naturalized U.S. citizen father. 

There was also someone on here who helped his wife get her passport  (deceased US citizen mother who left as a child) in Canada.  That was more difficult as he had to build up the residence proof for a child.

I would just write it all out.  Use that ILRC guide I sent.  The U.S. embassy in NL also has a nice chart very similar to ILRC in format.

I'll just answer your question. I moved to the US from the UK for my SO, whom I met on an exchange program (sorry mum I know I promised not to fall in love with an American!)

It's an adjustment, and it's hard. Like, I just got my citizenship after about 8 years of *the process*. Add to that that this country is wonderful in so many ways, but totally messed up in others (probably not unlike your own). The difference is that the things that are messed up or not are totally different and it really scrambles your head for a while.

But I will say, in general, it's going well. I moved here for the woman I love, so that's great. I also have an arts degree. The critical thinking skills that an arts degree teaches you is invaluable - no matter what anyone says. I transitioned into tech and have never looked back - and it's going rather well!

I don't regret it. It was a huge gamble on my part but it was absolutely and totally worth it. But it was very very painful and difficult and lonely at times. But sometimes you just have to make the leap!

I miss feeling safe pretty much at all times too, back where I'm from almost nobody owns guns. If you hear something that reminds a gunshot you can be 99,9% certain that it's just fireworks. Healthcare is also another story, I spent about 3 hours here in the hospital once due to some kind of a virus (something reminding a  norovirus), got an IV and an EKG test - received a bill for about $2000. Back in my home country you can get full chemo and radiation treatment and you don't pay a penny. Here my mother in law was initially asked to pay $7000 per month for her post-chemo pills (luckily managed to get them for free though, since her income isn't high enough). So good health insurance is incredibly important. People are nice to me here though, they're really kind and supportive. I appreciate them and everything they've done for me and my husband.

Going to school and college was an amazing experience in the US but the corporate world is tough. It’s not for everyone. You have to be very driven, social and hard working to make it. If you are working class it’s better to be working class in Europe. If you make good money it’s better to be in the US.

Coming to the US legally is incredibly difficult. My father was a CEO at a major company went the L1 and EB-1C route and it took us 6 years until we even had the green card in hand. I’m privileged, they would have never let me into the country if I wasn’t my father’s son.

He can up his income by taking classes (a class would be 3-5 credits- at $46/credit - every increment of 14 credit hours merits a $4000.00 pay increase a year.  You can earn up to 98 salary points to maximize your income. In the Netherlands he was making 62500/year and he hit the ceiling, per government rules he was not going to make more.  64500 is the starting salary for a brand spanking new teacher with no experience in L.A.  Due to high taxes he did not bring as much home and they were living paycheck to paycheck in the Netherlands .  His wife also had to work, without wife’s income they could not make it.
The school district here in L.A. pays all benefits for whole family - they have excellent health care,dental, etc.
My brother loves his job and colleagues (he had many positive experiences in the Netherlands too) but he finds he has more resources and more help here.  He has landed at a great school.  Their quality of life has gone up; even without his wife not working he can save money to save for a house.

His kids love America, they do well in school and adapted pretty quickly, have tons of friends. They do complain of too much homework (and I kinda agree - their school is a very good school).  They love that sports are attached to school (one plays baseball, the other soccer).  

The Mom is gonna work at my company soon and they will be above six figure income.  

I own my home and have two 2bd rooms that I rent out. I live in one of the “cool” areas of Los Angeles (Silverlake).  The cool thing is was able to help my brother and family get a cool spacious apartment across from me.

My brother and my nephews are outside a lot due to our great weather.  We live near Griffith Park.

I think the homelessness of L.A. is a shocker and the difference between poor and rich but overall they prefer to live here in the US than the Netherlands.

Now, even though rent is higher in L.A. because they are not getting taxed out of the ass; they are able to save while still eating out, going to movies, etc.  

There are horrible things in the US - the homelessness is like when I first came to the US highly visible again and at unacceptable levels with no solutions in sight, we are politically playing with fire, and divided.  I can’t vote GOP because of the main actors in that party and still feel at home in the Dem party.  And of course the gun violence which is a uniquely American problem where a certain political party just keeps getting in the way of sensible solutions.

And the thing is that lots of Americans have degrees Marketing and in Communications (which are more distinct in the US than in EU: a company would not hire a marketer to do PR, etc.). You’re also not specialized enough to make the case that you’re extraordinary in your field, and your work experience is in yet another unrelated area. 

From a career standpoint, if you want to work in comms (internal or external) or in marketing your best bet would be going the large agency route in your home country first rather than trying to be corp in-house. They’ll train you and get you the more specialized experience your CV needs. You’ll get to see if you want to go more into product marketing, corporate comms, media relations, investor relations, public affairs, event planning, etc., and build your profile. Especially at the early career stages they usually have exchange programs. If they have a remote work policy they might let you work from local offices at different times of year. You can leverage your multiple languages to raise your hand for local projects, and join all the buddy programs to build a network. 

Final point - don’t move for a SO this early in your life, move only if it makes sense for what you want to do with your career. If it’s meant to be with this person, then it’ll pan out in the end, but you need your own security first.

immigration,comment,l3r5v6f,not_an_immi_lawyer,,"Yes, your I-94 is the only controlling document and you must always leave before the I-94 expires or file an extension/change of status before the I-94 expires. 

You can also try filing with deferred inspection (CBP), but given how long it's been and it's unclear/you have no proof that you told CBP you wanted to enter on TD, I'm doubtful you'll find success.

The stamp on your passport has zero meaning once you're inside the US, it only has meaning when you're outside the US trying to enter the US.

If you overstay, you will acquire unlawful presence, which has the following effects:

1. If you have a B visa, it's automatically cancelled for the overstay.

2. From now on, you can only apply for visas at the US embassy of your country of nationality. Overstayers lose the privilege of applying at other US embassies.

3. From now on, every time you apply for visas or immigration status anywhere in the world (including the US/green card), you must answer ""yes"" to a question asking if you've ever overstayed your visa. This will result in increased scrutiny of your applications.

4. Based on a previous overstay, CBP may deny you entry in future (even on a valid TD stamp/visa) on the basis that you are likely to fail to abide by the conditions of entry granted by CBP.",2024-05-12T20:00:54+00:00

My visa got approved for 4 years as stated in the expiration date and my letter of employment. When I crossed the border (in an airport if that matters), I gave my visa to the official and he asked the typical questions, what’s your job? Pay? Etc etc, then he asked how long was my visa for, to which I replied 4 years. He said that was impossible, that the maximum was 3 years. I told him it was approved for 4 and the expiration date said 2028. He looked at it closely and then said that was impossible and asked if I had paid extra for it and I said no. He typed something in his computer and examined my employment letter for what felt like forever.

I am not sure what would happen if you reenter after the initial 3 years, in prínciple an updated offer letter should be enough for cbp to let you reenter, since this is not unlike automatic visa revalidation.

I've got a new Job, however, I have a bit of a time and travelling conflict. The time overlap is for a month though, not much. It can be avoided if there's a need to.

My current H1B isn't expired yet.

Which is better? That the new employer file a petition for transferring my H1B from my current employer to them or start a new H1B ( H-1B petition for 'concurrent employment')?

Is there anything bad with the concurrent employment option? Given that the overlap is just a month only?

Also, for the H1B transfer, can I work with my current employer until I get the new transfered H1B from the new employer officially or I have to leave my current job once my new employer starts the process of peitioning for H1B/ transferring the H1B?

immigration,post,1cq99cj,cutecandy1,Fear of not being accepted in Germany,"25M Indian here. I'm facing a huge dilemma since last few months which I think about every day. 

I'm a person who likes to socialize, travel, make new friends and have new experiences with people. I know for a fact that if I move to an English speaking country I wouldn't have any issues doing all these with the natives. But since I'm in Germany and don't know the language, my biggest fear that's holding me back from learning German is the fact that I will never be accepted as well as native Germans.

I go Salsa dancing and I have never been able to connect as well as people as they do with each other, even though they speak English. I go travelling and it's the same story again. Not blaming anyone, just sharing my experiences. 

Because of this fear, I'm considering relocating to an English speaking country like UK or Canada. I really like Germany and want to live here long term and would prefer it over UK or Canada (because of the relaxed work culture, more vacation days, strong job security, less crime, etc), but just because of the language barrier, I'm considering moving. Am I overthinking it or am I (somewhat) right? 

Ideally I want to be able to make German friends and date German women. But not sure if I'd be able to do that even if I learn the language (say even upto C1).",2024-05-12T14:35:55+00:00
immigration,comment,l3qhe11,NotHereToAgree,,"Won’t you need to be fluent in German for permanent residency? Won’t you life there be easier if you are? 
If you like the rest of the culture enough, you should give it a try. Germany had a large influx of immigrants in the past decade and as people age, they tend to be more welcoming, although you seem to not want to do your part.",2024-05-12T17:25:03+00:00
immigration,comment,l3q5d2a,Grim-Sleeper,,"If you actually manage to learn German to a C1 level, that will make a huge difference. It's not easy to get to that point and takes several years, but it'll make it much easier to integrate.


Realistically, any foreign country that you move to will take a long while to make you truly feel at home. And Germany can be particularly challenging, not because it is necessarily objectively harder, but just because Germans are on a whole less warm and outgoing when engaging with others. This can feel like being pushed away.


But this happens to everyone, even if you're German. Social interactions in Germany can feel odd, if you're not used to them. 


And at some point you'll learn the culture and figure it out. But again, that can take years. But it would do so in other countries too, just maybe for different reasons. Some immigrants are better about working on integration than others, and most immigrants naturally have a preference and affinity for one culture over another. Hard to tell whether this is Germany for you, or maybe some other country.


No matter what you do, immigration takes deliberately and intentional effort. If you only stick to groups of expats, you'll always feel as an outsider in the country. But making friends with locals, takes work, resilience, self confidence, and the willingness to accept set backs.




Good luck",2024-05-12T16:08:51+00:00

This problem seems like a self-reinforcing vicious cycle that stems mostly from you not knowing German. Even if people know English that doesn't mean they want to switch to English all the time just because you exist. It doesn't make sense why you're continuing to not know German when there's nothing at all that you will lose from learning German. You won't even lose time by learning and practicing German. Only after you can conversationally speak German does the question of ""they won't accept me equally into their social circles solely on the basis of my race"" even become relevant, and unless your social circles are exclusively stupid (which they very well may be, I don't know) you can usually find someone who can think properly and socialize with you in German language the way they would with anyone else",2024-05-12T16:02:31+00:00

We motioned a third time to be removed from the immigration court with proof of over marriage and kids. We heard back yesterday, that our motion was denied, saying good cause has not been established, Respondent doesn't not appear to be prima facie eligible to apply for collateral relief at this time. And it looks like her Dec 2025 has been removed of the docket as well. She has 25 days to appeal this decision. I am not sure what to do and what steps to take next.

immigration,comment,l3t21dd,ShroomyGuts,,"As others have mentioned, it depends on your individual case, officer and the kind of visa you're applying for. This only applies to B2 visas. Generally speaking, they don't have time to look through documents and will generally issue the visa without any documents if they feel confident in your story and there aren't any complications.

If they can't make a decision based on your interview alone, they will call on a team of case officers whose job it is to review documents and make final decisions on more complex cases. If this is the case, they will ""refuse"" the application for administrative processing (this is the yellow slip) and you'll need to send relevant documents as per the instructions on the letter. This isn't a ""true"" refusal per se, it's just your case officer declining to make a final decision at this time. Your application will show as refused while this is in progress, but if the reviewing officer determines you are eligible after seeing your documents, it will change to approved. 

They can also issue a straight-up refusal (I think this is the white slip), which is very much a refusal in the true sense of the word.

For the record I got a B2 visa as a citizen of an ESTA country (ineligible for other reasons) and it was approved within a few questions. No documents were needed.",2024-05-13T04:16:06+00:00

New plan is to fly to the US mid July on ESTA, leave for France after the wedding (cuz round trip to France is the cheapest), travel two wks in France, then fly back to the US enter with F-1. Please lmk if there’s problems with the plan 🥺🥺🙏
————————

I’m an incoming student for 24fall and the earliest I can enter the US is early August on F-1, but I really want to go to my bf’s family wedding. 

Q1. Is it ok if I use ESTA for the wedding and leave after that to re-enter? (maybe arrive a couple days before 7/28 and leave the US before 8/3)

Or is it more recommended that I don’t go to the wedding?🥲

Q2. If it’s doable, should I fly back home (Taiwan) and fly again to the US to switch my status? Or can I go to Canada or Mexico to switch it in one day? Or can I actually plan a few days trip there(Canada maybe) and come back?

Here’s My US travel bg:

2023/06-08: summer study on F-1 
2023/12-2024/02: visit bf (52 days)

2024/03: visit for bf’s bday (5 days)

I’m currently on H1-B visa. H1-B is valid till May of 2026 (with recapture time). My current employer has initiated immigration process via EB3 (prevailing wage determination is in progress, started in January 2023). I failed to get PERM approval with previous employer due to a company-wide layoffs in 2023. Also, due to an armored conflict in my home country I also have temporary protected status (TPS) that is designated through April of 2025. Government of my home country has also just passed a new mobilization law that will require all males in certain age group to renew their military-related info. This might have significant consequences to me in the future as I might not be able to renew my foreign passport easily in consulate (it’s impossible right now because of another temporary restrictions). My foreign passport expires in 5 years.

Taking into account this input I’d really appreciate your thoughts on how to get minimum (I-140 approval so that I can renew my H1-B post 6 years) or maximum (green card approval) result out of this. Since I’ve already failed with PERM approval with my previous employer I’d like to come up with some general strategy on how not to fail this time (e.g. what it’d be better to do if PWD/recruitment/actual PERM takes too much time, goes though audit or gets denied). I consider applying for EB2 NIW, but am a bit hesitant (popular EB2 NIW layers like Ellis Porter and North America Immigration Law Group decided not to move forward as I do not have academic background). Are there any other options?

https://web.archive.org/web/20040111205636/http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/index.htm

an I-130 in January 2004 costs $130. If we adjust the price using basic CPI inflation calculator, it comes out to $219.24 in March 2024 prices.

I understand that immigration is a privilege and that living with a foreign spouse comes with costs not normally needed when one marries a citizen. But to be put in worse position 20 years later just stinks. The differential is about 3 times more than it was when adjusted for inflation. On top of that USCIS is a piece of shit.

I want to get bit of clearification here regarding the domestic violence order. I was in a romantic relationship with a guy for past 4 years. The guy and I got into a fight last year. Basically guy started being towards me and I defended back which we both ended of getting minor injuries. Things were sorted out back then and we were still normal. Guy made an application to the court this year based on 2023 incident for domestic violence intervention order against me where I was the main victim. My court date is appearing soon. I dont have any order in place. I want to resolution outside the court however he doesn’t want to come to the conclusion. The main point here is

I am planning to apply for my Australian citizenship. What if I accept the order but not the alligation. Will that still affect my citizenship application if I don’t breach the order? If I apply for the citizenship application after the order expires, will that still affect my citizenship application?  Please give me some advice guys. I am stressing so much.

I'm a USC currently living in S. Korea, where I've been since I was 7, and I'm in the process of filing an IR1 for my wife. We're planning to move to the States once her conditional offer from a US company becomes permanent, dependent on her getting a Green Card. After we move, I'm also looking to start graduate studies.

To show our intent to establish domicile in the US, here's what we've got:

* A conditional offer letter for my wife(non-USC) from her future employer in the US.
* Evidence that I'm preparing for grad school, like test records.
* FBAR and tax returns from the last three years.

  
However, we're a bit stuck because I don’t have a bank account, driver's licenses, voting records, job hunting records, or a lease in the US. We plan to stay in an Airbnb while we look for a more permanent home, which makes it hard to secure a leasing contract right away—one of the stronger pieces of domicile evidence.

immigration,post,1cpufnn,Pale-Explorer-4631,I forgot my parents' birth date? And how can I get the visa this time?,"Hello

I have a green card. I have been in America for 4 years. I will even apply for citizenship this July. I live in NJ. I want to bring my uncle to America on a b1 b2 visa. He will spend a month on vacation with me and I will show him around the country. This was our general plan, but he was rejected a few months ago in his first visa attempt. He has a Kyrgyz wife who is retired from carpentry and gardening. They got married a few years ago. He lives in Giresun. He has a pension and receives it every month. As you can see, there is a compelling reason. Even though he is married, I wrote the form as single in DS 160 without knowing it (I was a little distracted and filled out the form hastily). He forgot my address, he couldn't tell me when asked, when he was asked where he will stay, now we will try for the second time, this time I want him to fill out everything completely and get his visa with caution, there is a visa interview on July 11, even this time I will print out the invitation letter and i-134 affidavit form, fill it out completely, scan it and send it. He should keep it with him and show it to the officer at the consulate, but since I didn't remember the date of birth of my grandmother and grandfather while filling out the DS 160 and I couldn't find it at the time, I filled in the ""do not known"" box and passed and submitted the DS 160 form and the dues money was also deposited for DS 160 and By the way, the appointment date was taken, but later I was able to find the birthday dates of both of them from my father, but it was too late now, I filled out the DS 160 form and finished it, I sent the information a few days ago, I want to ask my purpose now, do you think it will cause any problems at the consulate if these are listed as ""do not known""? Should I enter, create a new form, get a new confirmation number and fill out the DS 160? I have also read articles about the need to pay a fee again if I fill it out. Is there really such a situation on the net? If I click create new after submitting and create a new one, will I have to pay a fee again or is it worth it or is it like this? Isn't there a problem if he stays at the consulate interview? I would appreciate it if you could enlighten me about my questions. Apart from the questions I asked, you can also give information about what else we can do so that he can get the visa with a high probability this time. By the way, he has been to Georgia and Kyrgyzstan before, these are the countries he has visited so far. I will give it as additional information.

thanks",2024-05-11T23:40:36+00:00
immigration,comment,l3nb5p7,BlueNutmeg,,"You made some big mistakes, my friend. The biggest one if think YOU are the one to ""bring [ your] uncle to America on a b1 b2 visa"". It does NOT work  that way. You do not do anything. Your uncle is the one who applies on his own. And you making a mistake on his marital status is one of the main reasons why foreign applicants should complete their own forms. 

There is NO sponsorship for tourist visas to America. This is a huge misconception with foreigners. The more they have an American ""help"" with the visa, the more they are likely to get denied. 

Second, there is NO invitation letters for a tourist visa to America. You writing one is a waste of time. They will not even look at it. Your uncle can tell you himself that they didn't ask for any documents from his last interview.

Lastly, foreigners who keep applying immediately after denials look desperate. And are often rejected. And each attempt after that is noted.

It's a sticky one because you need to simultaneously show ties to Iran without being too tied down to Iran if you get my vibe 🤣

You need first of all to show you won't overstay in America, and Iran is not a good country to live in so you will need a lot of evidence to prove you will come back (property, businesses, immediate family members, job that requires you to be physically be in Iran etc.) 

At the same time, you don't want to be too heavily invested in Iran, a country viewed by the U.S. as a state sponsor of terrorism. So if your job is even remotely government-related, then forget about it. If you have said anything anti-American on social media, or anything to support the Islamic Republic of Iran, that will likely get you denied as well. They will want proof you didn't do military service.

Earlier this year i was selected in the H-1B lottery and my company is still going to file my H-1B petition and is asking me whether to do it through ""consular processing"" or ""change of status"".

I am aware that:

* I should receive at least one payslip from my current employer for the H-1B to be valid
* The above won't happen because i will be laid off before Oct 1st 2024, which is when i'd be able to switch from my L-1B to H-1B

However, i've read of other people in similar situations that were able to find employment elsewhere even with no payslips from the previous employer, so i still want my current company to file the H-1B petition.

With the above context, i was considering to request filing the H-1B petition using ""consular processing"", would you recommend to do differently?

immigration,comment,l3n2h1j,Specific_Refuse_8584,,"If the local laws do not provide for legitimation or adjudication by court, then perhaps the mother might need to find a way to move legally to a place where there is no difference in children born in wedlock or out of wedlock. The laws allows you to do legitimation based on the child's residence while under 18.

In addition, as far as court adjudication goes the wording of the statute is 

>  the paternity of the person is established by adjudication of a competent court.

If you cannot get paternity adjudicated by a court in the country the child will be born in, you may want to ask your immigration lawyer if ""competent court"" means a court where just the father lived. For example, if your brother lived in the US for a significant amount of time before his death, then you need to find out from a local family lawyer in the state he lived in if they can get a court order for determining paternity from that state's court. This is dependent on if the state's statutes allow for determination of paternity where the child is outside the state and/or whether the state would have jurisdiction over your brother by virtue of his domicile or residence in the state. Domicile is a bit different from residence and I encourage you to ask your immigration lawyer about it. The key thing is whether the court had jurisdiction to hear the case and pass an order adjudicating paternity.

One example where paternity could be determined is as part of estate or probate proceedings. If your brother lived in the US and died without a will, then you'll probably need to do a whole bunch of things in court. Even if he died with a will, he may not have modified it to include his child. This is really complex area of law and you will need the help of an estate lawyer, family lawyer, and immigration lawyer.

Your immigration lawyer will help you figure out if it is possible whether a US court order determining paternity as part of estate proceedings or probate would count under INA 309 (this is the law that governs out of wedlock children born to US citizen father and foreign women). 

Your family and estate lawyer would help you figure if it is at all possible in the state your brother lived in or lived in for significant portion of his life to get any sort of court order determining paternity.

One thing to make sure is that if you use your brother's residence just prior to his death as a basis for the state court's jurisdiction, the state court must be in the same state that your brother listed on the I-129F he filed for his fiancee.

Good luck.",2024-05-11T23:22:57+00:00

immigration,post,1cpmzjk,mondscheinsonate,Removal proceedings since 2020; Master calendar hearing scheduled for 2025. Advice moving forward?,"Hi all, I was hoping for some advice on my current predicament with my mother. To preface, I have been consulting attorneys since we originally received the Notice to Appear in March 2020 with a Master Hearing originally scheduled for early 2021 in Chicago due to her not having a valid immigration status. We did not retain a lawyer since the Master Hearing was taken off the docket and now only recently put back. Now the Master Hearing is scheduled for January 2025 in Chicago. 

Of note, I'm in the process again of seeking immigration lawyers to help with this, but I would greatly appreciate anyone's advice or thoughts on the manner, so that's why I posted to this sub. 

Some background information: My mother overstayed her visitor's visa in the late 90's and has been out of status since it expired. The NTA was received after her application for another type of visa was denied since she did not have a valid status. The only immediate relative she has with legal status is me, her only child, and I just obtained my green card through marriage in August of last year with plans to immediately apply for citizenship when possible and petition my mother. This process I estimate would take at least three years before I could even file for her, so I'm exploring all options. I do have many questions currently and if someone has any advice on ANY of them I would extremely appreciate it. 

1. What are the chances the Master Hearing will be rescheduled again?  When would we find this out approximately? I know the immigration courts have been backlogged for awhile, so I'm also hoping the Master Hearing will get rescheduled again in a few years so I have time to petition her. I know this is wishful thinking but also perhaps a real possibility since I've heard court cases take years. 

2. I'm hoping to consult a lawyer about prosecutorial discretion/administrative closure. My mother has a clean background and has been in the country for 25+ years, and I believe is considered a low enforcement priority. Anyone have information about this such as time frame, necessary documents, and success rate? And what happens if it gets denied by the judge? I know this does not confer legal status but my goal is to get enough time so I can petition her.

3. If the Master Hearing does occur, then how far out would the next hearing possibly be? I've heard conflicting accounts between months and years. 

4. Any thoughts on possible relief if prosecutorial discretion/administrative closure does not work and we the case goes ahead? Again, I'm hoping to petition her as soon as I can.

5. Will immigration judges take into consideration that I have a green card and planning to petition her in the future? 

  
Thank you in advance to everyone!!",2024-05-11T17:47:17+00:00
immigration,comment,l3m2omu,suboxhelp1,,"1. Assume that it will not be rescheduled. Nothing substantive happens at this hearing though, and she will receive another date to appear at that time.

The questions you ask would be best asked to a lawyer who is very experienced in asking for and getting PD, but if she has a clean background and a potential path to adjust in the future, PD is a real possibility. Start on this now.
3. No way to know. It depends mostly on your specific court. But it's not weeks.
4. Need to ask this to a deportation lawyer. There are some things you can possibly do--but depends on her specific situation and history.

immigration,post,1cpmw0s,Gullible-Effect-150,Does DoS pay attention to legal briefs from immigration lawyers for CRBA case,"**Background**:

The questions are yes/no questions and are listed at the bottom. The short version the story it my son, who is a US citizen, died late last year mere months after having a kid out of wedlock with his foreign partner. He spent >5 years in the US, 2 after 14.

**Issue**

I am concerned about whether the documentation could pass muster with DoS for INA 309(a)(4).

I am considering hiring an American immigration lawyer and a foreign family lawyer to write up legal briefs to present to DoS in the CRBA application on why the evidence I have fulfills the statutory requirements.  

**Questions**

1. Will DoS pay any attention to the legal brief written by the lawyers to address why the documents I have fulfill the statutory requirements?

2. Would you say it would cost about $1000-2000 to hire an American immigration lawyer to write such a legal brief?

3. Should I hire a foreign lawyer to explain the foreign law for the 3rd way: court adjudication of paternity? 

4. For INA 309(a)(4)(C) court adjudication of paternity, does the word ""paternity"" in the statute refer to the biological fact of paternity only? 

5. Under INA 309(a)(4)(A) legitimation, if my grandson was born in one country that discriminates against illegitimate children but now lives in another country now where they don't, can we still fulfill the statutory requirement for legitimation if we can provide evidence of his new residence in the new country?

6. Do you have any recommendations on which lawyers specialize in CRBA cases?",2024-05-11T17:42:24+00:00

immigration,post,1cpmkfu,Euphoric_Kalua1550,What is the best (cheapest)  way to get Green card through nursing,"Hi, i did an exchange student over in US and fell in love with everything. The language, culture, scenery, people…etc. I want tolive in the states and figured the easiest way would be through nursing.(not that nursing is easy, just in my situation ig) Im currently a senior in a completely different major and will be graduationg next year(bachelors ofc). I think  but i dont want to put too much financial burden on my family. because of this im considering getting my license+work experience in another coutry but thrn it would take me too long to eventually move to US.

i dont remember precisely but it seems like with my bachelors degree i can get admitted to a graduate nursing program that will take around two years to graduate. But even tuition for those two years is very very expensive😭😭  
here comes the main part. I read that if you get a adn your workplace can support you through getting a bn. even if they dont cover much of the tuition, i think i can manage because i will be making money by then too.

  
So my question is, can you get a greencard/sponserd at least with an adn license?

and then maybe get a chance to pursue bsn??",2024-05-11T17:26:49+00:00

Do I need to apply for this grace period, or is it automatically activated right after my termination date? From my Google search, I got the impression that it would be activated automatically. However, upon reviewing the following clause on the USCIS website, it seems that there must be some kind of application process, although it does not indicate how to apply for it.

***Q: How do I apply for the grace period?***

*A: We will determine whether the grace period applies to your case during the adjudication of a subsequent extension of stay petition, change of status application, adjustment of status application, or compelling circumstances employment authorization application. Petitioners and applicants should state in a cover letter that they are requesting that we favorably exercise our discretion to grant the up to 60-day grace period.*

My green card was prepared for a future/prospective role (Data Analyst II - Level 5) but I am not yet promoted to prospective/perm sponsored role. Rather, I am currently at ""Data Analyst - Level 4"" and promotion hasn't happened yet. Since my time line is current as per visa bulletin and I will be getting green card approved soon. Is it  very necessary that I have to be in the PERM sponsored role (future role) at the time when I-485 is approved by USCIS? 

1. Can this same company (which I am employed in currently who has filed for prospective role) can file I-485 J Supplement and downlevel the role at i.e., at Data Analyst I Level 4 from what they filed initially i.e., at Data Analyst II Level 5?  

2. If the green card is approved and if I am not having that future sponsored role, then what are the issues/consequences that I need to be aware of and what is the work around in that scenario?

3. If they are not planning to promote me at Data Analyst II Level 5 any time soon and my green card gets approved and after getting green card, I leave the company in 2-3 weeks, will this be an issue or a problem later in the naturalization?  

4. Do I need to be employed with the company until they promote me to that level after my green card approval or I can leave the company once I get the green card (which I want to) or this approach will be problematic for me?  


4. How will the USCIS know that I am having working at perm sponsored role i.e., at Data Analyst II Level 5 or not? It's not written on paystubs or W2 either. Do they check this thing or see this when it comes to naturalization or call the company's HR to inquiry this?

immigration,comment,l3lfifl,TraditionalYellow323,,"I am not a lawyer. 

I am not sure if you have to be physically present in the US when filing the reentry permit or when it is approved. Look at the instructions on the form.

I filed one for my wife and it was approved after some months. But we weren't in any hurry to leave the US because we have flexible jobs and living situations in both US and India (where my wife is from). 

I do know you can be outside the US for up to 6 months. However, if you follow that rule, but you spend most of your time outside the US, it can lead to problems with naturalization and can even be considered abandonment.

For example, suppose you:

1. leave US in January 

2. come back in May

3. stay for only 2-3 weeks in US

4. Leave again

5. Come back again in November before the 6 month rule

Then this sort of travel problems can cause problems because if you get a nasty CBP or USCIS officer, they can think you abandoned your green card. It can lead to problems during naturalization. However, you can counter them by saying you had a good reason to be outside the US. Medical education is certainly a good reason. But these arguments are tricky to make and need a lawyer. 

So it is in your best interest to get a reentry permit. A reentry permit makes everything much more simpler and clear to everyone (you, USCIS, CBP, etc.).

We were able to have her parents visit on a tourist visa, but she is now looking for ways to extend their stay. She had planned to petition for their green cards, but it seems the law has changed at some point and she, a lawful permanent resident can no longer do that.

My father is a small business owner and she has an idea about having him offer them a work visa, but I’m somewhat dubious on that front (they don’t have any relevant skills and are retired in any case).

I know we can petition to extend their visiting visa for a while, but I’m not sure how long you can do that.

immigration,post,1cpjgdt,Dizzy_Feeling_9139,DS 260 with overstay history," Sorry for the long post. Thanks in advance!!

I've been a US citizen since 2016, with the country of origin of China. My parents decided to come and join me in the US in 2021.  
We submitted the i130 in 2021 June. My parents decided to come and visit us three months later in September 2021, with their b1b2 Visa (valid till 2026).

So the immigration process started via the embassy Visa process, as I heard we can do the status adjustment within the US once they come here. So they came with the B1 B2 Visa with no problem and I've been contacting USCIS since then to switch from the Embassy process to I 485.

In June 2022, we finally received their approval of I-130, however USCIS still sent the process to NVC. I also contacted NVC to switch that process to I45 but no response.

In November 2023, NVC scheduled us for the immigration visa interview in Guangzhou China. I did inquiry and messaging the embassy and NVC to change it to adjustment of status, still no avail. So we decided to send them to China for the interview.

During their stay from 2021 to 2023, my 2-year-old got cancer and then we aalso got a newborn son. They were staying here to help us to get over the difficult time plus it was covid travelling ban. So we only extended their b1b2 Visa for one time because we thought we're going to have i-485 status adjustment which doesn't require the extension. 

At the interview the interviewer asked my parents to show all the documents and once she saw their immunization and physical examination was done in the US, then she immediately cancelled this appointment saying they have to do it in the designated examination locations in China. So the next step will be to make another appointment with the embassy and take that appointment paper to have a physical exam.

Okay we just followed that but six months passed there's no opening for interview availability. However, last week my mom received the email from the non-immigrants Visa unit from the US Embassy in Guangzhou, saying the visa was revoked under INA 212(a)(9)(B) as of April 30, 2024. Since the email is coming from the non-immigrant Visa unit From US Consulate, and it was referring to the old passport that was used for the 10-year b1b2 Visa, I assume that this is not about the new IR5 Visa that is currently being applied. I think this happens because during their stay from 2021 to 2023, we only renew their b1b2 visa extension for one time which is 6 months, the reason being that we thought they are doing the status adjustment within the US so they don't have to extend the b1b2.

Now I realise because of that, they cannot come to the US without a waiver(i601) for 10 years since the last b1b2 visa extension.  
What can we do now?

The current plan is just keep making that ds260 appointment and explaining the situation to the interviewer. Once/if we got the ir5 Visa, do we still need the waiver to pass CBP when crossing the border?

Here is the email from the non-immigrant unit:  
""Dear Non-Immigrant Visa Applicant XXXXXXX

Please be advised that your U.S. visa has been revoked by the U.S. Department of State. The visa was revoked under INA 212(a)(9)(B) as of April 30, 2024.

This action is based on the fact that subsequent to visa issuance, information has come to light indicating that you may be ineligible to receive a visa, such that you should be required to reappear before a U.S. consular officer to establish your eligibility for a visa before being permitted to apply for entry to the United States.

Please note that you will be unable to travel on your current U.S. visa. If you would like to travel to the United States, you must re-apply for a new visa. Please refer to the below Questions and Answers for further details.

Sincerely,

Non-Immigrant Visa Unit

Prior to moving from the US to Canada at first, I *genuinely* had no idea how bad it was. My family in the US still has no idea and views it as just a happier and safer version of us. One thing I've noticed is that Canadians have a lot to say about everyone else but very little tolerance for others doing the same to them -- and this has worked. People genuinely do not know Canadian issues.  

- People *SHOULD* know why people move away from somewhere so that they can make an informed decision about the pros and cons. See above. 

- It's hard when the cons were our inability to eat or start a family. I worked at a B4 accounting firm as a tax senior, my husband worked as a network engineer. I'm First Nations so have dual and once my husband got a job in the US, and we saw our salary jump, that pretty much solidified that for us. People *should* know that people with ""safe and well paying"" careers are struggling. They should know that we weren't able to afford a place where we could have kids. They should know that our grocery bill was $400+ a month in Ontario. 

It's not bashing a country by being upfront about its problems. People should know both sides before they move. We just moved, but we plan to sell our home in the next 10 years and move back with american equity. There's something to say about Canada that a lot of us who moved felt so out of necessity and not out of hatred for the country.

If you want to ATTEMPT guardianship, you would likely need to spend money for a lawyer. And it is still NOT a guarantee it will be successful. This is why putting that money to a student visa is less of a risk.

Listen, survivors remorse is HUGE with immigration. Immigrants come here and get a better life but have family that is still struggling and suffering back home. We see it a lot.

immigration,comment,l3k3us6,thunder_fire,,"For economy reasons: Listing countries where you'd likely get a higher salary than the rest. USA, Switzerland, Luxemburg, Ireland, Singapore (though not Western).

For cost of living: Spain, Portugal, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary.

For language: what languages do you speak? If only English, USA, Canada, Ireland, UK, NZ, Australia, or a Nordic country where the English level of the general population tends to be very good.

For easy immigration rules: It depends on where you're from, your ancestry, your capital, your skills, or your employment. If you have Irish or Italian ancestry I think you can easily get those citizenships and move to an EU country. If you're from Latin America or the Philippines, you can get naturalized in Spain in two years. If you have enough capital, you can get a golden visa or citizenship in Portugal or Malta, or you can also acquire a U.S. green card or a Canadian PR. If you have in-demand skills, both Canada and Australia have skill-based immigration programs. If you work for a multinational company, they can help you get work visas, which are usually great for immigration purposes, for example, you could move with an L1 visa to the USA if relocated through an American company, and have a somewhat straightforward path to a green card (many countries have something similar).

One more thing to consider is the weather and how much you can expect to adapt to the country. To give you an example, Ireland is on paper one of the best countries to immigrate to, generally high salaries, one of the best passports in the world (freedom of movement to both EU and the UK, visa-free access to the USA, Canada, NZ, Australia, etc), generally neutral country with a great perception around the world, easy passport to obtain if you have ancestry, and somewhat straightforward immigration rules (spend 5 years legally in the country and apply for naturalization). The weather, however, is not that great, it's very gray, rainy, and windy on most days, and some people would just not be happy or just down right depressed having to spend 5 years in Ireland to naturalize.

Often, the surviving parent may be about to receive payments for taking care of the child, though I'm not sure if having been married is a requirement.

If your child becomes disabled, they may qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance on their father's work history, which is more generous than the other type of disability payments, Supplementary Security Income, which does not depend on a parent's work history.

You can visit a local SSA office to find out more, but they won't be able to give definitive answers until you apply.

immigration,post,1cp5g3e,y0shiko1,Chances of getting a US B1/B2 visa,"My husband and I are remote workers in the Philippines. His company is inviting him to their Christmas party in December and is willing to pay for everything. Considering the opportunity, we're thinking it might be a good time for me to also try to apply for a tourist visa.

* Planning to stay for 7-10 days
* We have 3 kids, although we don't plan to bring them with us at this time
* He will be completely sponsored, I won't so I'm kind of on my own here...although his company is willing to send me an invitation letter if that would help (they might be willing to pay for my trip too, but we don't know if it would improve my chances of getting approved given that I'm not an employee)
* We have around US$10k in the bank (does he still need to provide proof of funds if he'll be sponsored by the company?)
* We've been to 3 countries together, Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in the past 5 years
* He has an aunt (with her husband and kids) in San Francisco, CA, but we won't be visiting them during this trip as we will be staying in Boston, MA. We have no other relatives or friends in the US. 
* We're renting in the PH but I do have a car in my name
* Not sure if it's relevant but I've been with my employer full-time since 2018 (but then again, it's remote work and his company is located in Israel)

What do you think are our chances? Any suggestions or tips would be very much appreciated too. Thank you!",2024-05-11T01:07:46+00:00

US generally doesn’t require letters or additional documents for B1/B2 visas, but he can still bring some supporting documents like a letter from the company. Better safe than sorry.

If she can't file the visa application herself or prefers not to, close to every US diplomatic representation there are several businesses that for a service fee will help applicants with filing the visa application.

My brother who was a a US citizen also had an accident in 2018. Ended up with Brain injury, coma etc…! Hospital have us emergency letter because the neurosurgeon didn’t think he was going to survive.

Thankfully, my brother survived, came out of coma but, became disabled, lost his ability to speak, no memory left, basically completely incapacitated in a vegetative state. Six years down the road he’s still in the same condition. My other brother tried 7 times and B2 denied all 7 times. I then applied for a Humanitarian Parole and it was approved.

immigration,post,1cp0cnh,ririrororororkrkrkfk,K1 vs old-fashioned in person marriage vs Utah online marriage,"I'm a US citizen who has been dating an Indonesian for the past several years. She is currently living in Indonesia. In Indonesia, a legal marriage must be between people of the same religion. We are not from the same religion. 

Our question is what would make our case more approvable

1. A marriage in a third country that allows interfaith mariages

2. A online Utah marriage

We are a bit hesitant on online Utah marriages because USCIS might think that we are marrying just to get my partner a green card whereas the real reason we are getting a green card is so that we can live together in the USA as a married  couple.

In addition, if you think option 2 is the best (i.e. a old-fashioned in person marriage), we would like suggestions from other people who have encountered similar difficulties on which countries fulfill the following criteria

1. Get a visa easily for an Indonesian citizen who is a teacher in her late 20s AND

2. Has an easy and efficient process for getting married without excessive documentation 

Otherwise we were thinking of going the K1 route

immigration,post,1coy5k2,unewatermelone,Can I travel to the US if I've had a visa declined elsewhere?,"Hello!

Bit of a long story but here goes: 
Approximately 10 years ago, I moved to New Zealand from Canada when I was 18 for love. I stayed on a working holiday visa and lived with my boyfriend at the time. After that visa expired, we applied for a partnership visa. Unfortunately, that relationship didn't last but honestly, I was a dumb teenager and stayed in the country because I didn't want to admit defeat and come home a failure. So I stayed in the country with what would be considered a null visa as I got some qualifications for my next visa which was tied to my work. I was granted a work visa a few months later and fell in love again (woohoo). After a year on the working visa, I wanted something more permanent so I applied for a partnership residence visa, but of course fudged the relationship timeline because I had technically overstayed. At this time, I was back in Canada waiting to hear back for about 7 months and eventually got a rejection letter from immigration NZ that I had provided misleading information and if I wanted entry to the country, I would be inadmissible unless I got a character waiver. This was rather devastating (but deserved) so I admitted defeat and haven't travelled since because I wasn't sure how this would affect me (I've watched too many episodes of border security).
So this brings us to today: I want to see the dang world but am not sure how to go about this process. Will this pose issues if I want to go for a day trip in the US? Who can I talk to find out more info?

immigration,post,1cox289,deliveringthagoods, How Hard is it to get a I-192 waiver with a long and violent criminal record?,"Hi there,

Thought I would post here because a lot of people here seem to actually know what they’re talking about.

Long story short, I have a really long criminal record, with a bunch of violent offenses. Last conviction was for a home invasion robbery and a bank robbery, I got sentenced to nine years for it. I’ve been off the books for 14 years now, but last time I applied for one I spent a lot of money on a lawyer, money I didn’t really have, and got turned down pretty hard. 

I’ve heavily researched this subject, most of those border waiver services are scams and will promise all kinds of things, and the reputable ones generally won’t work with cases they don’t consider likely to succeed. I hear urban legends about people with lengthy and violent records getting waivers, but I have personally never met anyone with a record similar to mine getting one - and I know a lot of people who’ve gotten one. (Usually it was for something a very long time ago, relatively minor, and often a one off)

So point-blank: how hard is it to actually get one of these things if you have a long and violent criminal record? 

Thanks. ",2024-05-10T18:53:06+00:00
immigration,comment,l3gzt6y,Flat_Shame_2377,,"I think it will be impossible for you. The U.S. doesn’t want to admit people with lengthy violent pasts. It’s easy to see why - if a person that has proven to be violent gets admitted and then commits a crime in the U.S., it will be a huge disaster and a major news story. Not saying that will be you, but it’s easier to not admit someone than take the chance.

 I don’t know of anyone with these crimes of home invasion and bank robbery getting approved.  

 If you feel you have it a good shot already and were denied, I don’t see the point in applying again.

immigration,post,1cowduo,Familiar-Safety-226,Will Japan start getting absolutely flooded with immigrants in the near future?,"This will be a little long. 

Most of the western world is getting increasingly harder to immediate to with more xenephobic stances taking place. Brexit was an example of that 8 years ago, and it’s still happening. 

Japan, by comparison is frankly way easier to immigrate to compared to other first world countries in the EU and North America for example. 

That, plus Japan have some population and demographic issues, plus perhaps the best soft power (anime, video games, manga, etc) in the world, will Japan start seeing massive floods of immigrants?

By immigrants, I’m referring to skilled immigration for professions needed in Japan, usually with a college degree. Because if moving to Japan is much easier than other 1st world countries, many will love to have the opportunity. Particularly from highly populated, yet developing nations like India, Bangladesh, Philippines, etc.

Will it eventually become like the U.S. where the demand to move there is so high that it takes decades for some people to get green cards, and the odds of getting the chance to work there are slim, and is really really hard?

Or will the fact that you need to know the Japanese language to work in Japan serve as a natural vet that ensures only people devoted to living in Japan can move there, and make it so for people who really want to live there, they won’t face an immigration process as draining as the United States simply by virtue of the demand for immigration to Japan being less due to Japanese being a niche language without use outside of Japan?",2024-05-10T18:24:23+00:00

Two years ago, right after high school, I was refused a visa. At that time, I was young and didn't realize how difficult visa interviews could be. I ended up lying in some of my answers because I wasn't prepared. And right after I was refused, I was late in registering for university.

I came to USA 2 years ago and got O1 here. Unfortunately I wasnt lucky with my employer and after a year I understood its enough, especially bc I had better offer (in other state). I started the process of new petition, and now already waiting for 2 months, but here the problem:

When I got the first one I stayed in USA and decided not to leave the country to get the visa in passport yet (bc you know they dont do consul interview here, for that you need to go to other countries, if you want to travel). With this one I was thinking to start the process outside of the USA (I miss my family and traveling), but wasnt able too, bc my previous employer decide to cancel my petition, but I still had apartment which I rented (you know how NYC market is..). So I started the process here, without the premium (one of the reason I changed the employer bc I was barely making money for living during their high percentage and way how to work), and was hoping to get new visa fast, bc first one I got only in a month (without premium process), and because everyone told me its just changing the employer - nothing hard.

But just yesterday I got message from my lawyer that the case can take up to the end of june. And i dont know what to do. I cant work, I barely have money to stay in USA for another 1,5 months, i dont have apartment anymore.. And if I leave everyone told me my petition will be cancelled.

immigration,post,1coovbf,Specialist_Job_4082,Green card or citizenship,"Hi everyone,

I've been accepted into an American college and I am wondering if I'm eligible for citizenship or green card.

My father is an American citizen.

My mother isn't.

My father lived in America from birth until he was 23. He now lives in America following my parent's divorce 6 years ago.

My dad is offering to file for a green card for me so that I can live and work in the USA without restrictions.

However, it seems I can apply for American citizenship by descent if I was born in wedlock.

I need to prove he spent 5 years in the USA. 

I should note I'm still under 18, 17 to be exact.

So I need the following:

1. Transcripts from college and high school of my dad

2. My birth certificate

3. His US birth certificate

4. His marriage certificate to my mom

5. His divorce certificate from my mom

6. My foreign passport as proof of ID

Can I get away with just using his transcripts? Or do I need more evidence of his physical presence? How many years/days of physical presence do his transcripts prove? Like how do they see summer breaks and weekends from the transcripts? My dad didn't live anywhere near the USA land borders. He loved to be in NYC during the weekends.

Simply holding a non immigrant visa has never precluded anyone from being a US citizen or a permanent resident - in fact it is the most common way people start their path to citizenship.

I visited using the ESTA 3 times whilst it processed (took 11 months). I had very little problem with CBP when I entered while we waited. 

It really depends on your situation. The K1 will get them to the U.S. permanently faster, but it has restrictions (as others have said) that makes it less appealing to a lot of people.

Your partner will be unable to leave or work for an extended period. That is taking people anywhere from 8 to 25 months.

We wanted to cut out the cost of flights between the UK and US, and can manage on one wage for the adjustment period. I also have a thesis to write to keep me occupied in that time. The cost of the AoS is less than one lot of UK-US flights. 

We prioritised being together in the U.S. sooner, rather than me being able to work and travel immediately. I’ve still been able to get my SSN, driving license, bank account, and library card, in the first 4 weeks since arriving on the K1. 

But every situation is different. It may well be that entering on an ESTA, marrying, and then having your partner leave and file for the spousal visa is the best option for you. That’s taking more like 18-24 months, but they can visit during that time.

immigration,comment,l3hts4a,Merisielu,,"Let me know if I can answer anything else K1-related.
We were shocked at it only taking 11 months as just before we applied absolutely **everywhere** said it would take 18+ months. 

It was 9 months for the initial I-129f to be accepted and then the London embassy is a fast moving one… so 60 days from the acceptance to the interview. 

The CR1 process takes longer, both for the paperwork to be approved and the wait time for interviews. 

For us, the speed of getting me to the U.S. permanently was worth it, even with the period of waiting for the adjustment. I appreciate that being unable to work or travel for a period that could extend to 2 years is just a big nope for a lot of people, but we just wanted to be in the same place and can muddle through the rest.

I recently won the Diversity Visa (DV) lottery, and I'm thrilled about the opportunity to apply for a green card. However, I'm facing a bit of confusion regarding the processing region for my case.

My case number begins with AS, indicating the Asia region. However, I was born in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) but have lived in Algeria for my entire life. While I hold Algerian nationality, my case seems to be assigned to the Asia region due to my place of birth.

I'm unsure whether I should follow the processing timeline for Asia or if I should align my application with Algeria, my country of residence and nationality.

Has anyone been in a similar situation or can offer guidance on how to proceed? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.

A year ago I fell in love with a woman and we plan on marrying. When we marry will I be able to obtain a GC? I have heard that if you’re a spouse of a USC you are usually safe, but I wasn’t a spouse of a USC before I started working illegally. I am still currently working. 

3 questions being, am I allowed to work whilst we file for my green card? 

Will I be under more scrutiny for evidence of marriage? We have been dating about a year, and plan to file for GC as soon as we marry. 

Will the process of obtaining the GC take longer than if I were to not currently be undocumented (entered legally and overstayed.) Can I expect to have the GC within at least 2 years from date of filling? ",2024-05-10T04:13:27+00:00

If you're answer is yes it is a tougher case and you need a lawyer. And will depend on exactly what you did. 

When you apply for a Greencard you can also apply for EAD card that will allow you to work. But that card takes time as well but will arrive before your Green Card.

So, there will be at least some period where you cannot work. 

Also does your fiancée make decent money? There is minimum amount she has to make to sponsor you but it's not much (some formula based on the poverty level). If not you can get a joint sponsor who does.

immigration,post,1cojbnk,NoDocument4837,Should I update my DS-160?,"Hi everyone, 

I am an international student in Canada and I applied for B2 US Visa on August 2023. I have my interview scheduled this month in the Vancouver consulate. I have two points of contact in the US which is 1) my childhood friend who is a US citizen and lives in Pennsylvania 2) my girlfriend who is an international student in the states and lives in North Carolina. When I filled my DS-160, I gave the address of my friend as the place where I will be staying. I was trying not to mention about my girlfriend anywhere as she is on her way to receive a US green card and it will slim down my chances since I am an international student in Canada who is also nearing his graduation. Now, its been almost a year since I filled my DS160 and my US friend will be travelling to another country for a year and will be returning back to the states in March 2025, so my itinerary will most likely be from Canada to North Carolina and back. I will mention that I will stay in a hotel in Charlotte, NC. Now I understand maybe just travelling to Charlotte would raise flags. Should I update my DS160 to mention I will be staying in a hotel in Charlotte, or should I include a stay in a popular tourist destination like NYC? I am open to visiting NYC, but there also I would mention staying in a hotel. Then my travel plans would be from Canada to NYC to Charlotte and back. If I get the visa accepted, I will for sure travel with a return ticket and complete hotel bookings. Also I still have a year left at my University in Canada which might increase my chances to get the visa. 

Could someone guide me on what should I do? Should I update my DS160? Should I mention at any places during the interview or even if I get the visa, at the port of entry about my girlfriend? ",2024-05-10T06:58:04+00:00
immigration,post,1coj6xm,panachora,US Resident Deported from Cartagena Columbia ,"If you plan on going to Colombia from the United States with a Green Card, you need a visa. 

I was denied entry by the immigration today. 

Before coming here, I did some research online and got mixed answers online and limited information from Colombia immigration website few months before traveling. 

Two days before traveling, I filled the Spirit Airlines international travel form and Colombia CheckMig form. I provided my information - national, passport#, US residency info… no issues. 

Thought I was good. So I planned my birthday. Got Airbnb. Rented a car and boat. I went all out prepping for a big birthday bash with friends. 

When I got to Fort Lauderdale airport, I asked the Spirit Airlines attendant to look at my documents and she said I was good to go to Cartagena.  

But getting here, I was denied entry and declared inadmissible by immigration. US Green Cards are not accepted. I needed a visa. 

They said this happens almost everyday. Truly, I checked Google again and saw people recently started posting about this same experience. 

I was in shock and later accepted my fate. So what can I do? I asked the officials. 

Can I get visa on arrival? No
Can I buy another ticket and go back? No
Can I go to Dominican Republic? No
What about Costa Rica? No
Board the next Delta Airlines flight to Atlanta? No

Well, I spent my big birthday bash locked up in detention sleeping through the night on a blue 5-seater bench with mosquitos. 

No food. No water. For over 24 hours until I was bundled into the next Spirit Airlines flight to go back where I came from. 

Lastly, I was made to sign some paperwork that I was not subject to physical, psychological or moral mistreatment and my dignity was respected at all times. Lol. Sick. 

Lessons Learned.
Always verify travel/visa requirements.
Don’t trust Spirit Airlines.
Don’t go back to Colombia. 

This experience made me appreciate America 🇺🇸 ❤️ Can’t wait to be a citizen.

immigration,post,1coifko,unicornviolence,Canadian Proof of Citizenship with estranged parent ,"Hello! I have a bit of a situation which I’m hoping someone can give me a bit of guidance on. I am posting this for the sake of my nephew who needs some help. For the sake of privacy I will be vague on some points. 

My nephew (American, over the age of 18) is estranged from his father, my brother (Canadian). My brother is a piece of work and none of us (including his son) want anything to do with him, nor does he try to have a relationship with my nephew.
My nephew was born and lives in the US and when he was born his American mother did not put my brother on the birth certificate as they were not together at the time (though he does have other documentation proving paternity). 

Fast forward 18 years. My nephew got accepted into a Canadian university. It is $30k cheaper for him to go to school if he is a Canadian citizen. 
He has been unable to get my brothers help on this despite efforts to get him to do so and my brother will not help (he is a real piece of work). 

My nephew has been going through the paperwork to get his Canadian Proof of Citizenship so he can become a dual citizen, but he’s hit a bit of a snag in that he does not have a copy and due to the estrangement, cannot get a copy of my brothers birth certificate. 

I was wondering if anyone knows/has some suggestions on how he would be able to get his citizenship with being estranged from the Canadian parent. Can he somehow get a copy of my brothers birth certificate through public record? 

Any advice of guidance would be appreciated",2024-05-10T05:57:12+00:00

immigration,post,1coic24,Optimus-Unprime,Wanting to immigrate from Australia to USA (18m),"So this is something I've been trying to look into lately. My situation is slightly unique so I really did look through tons of similar Reddit queries, and haven't found the clearest answer (as many ppl recommend marrying an American citizen but, I don't live in America)

So my family moved around a lot when I was a kid. Mainly Australia is where I grew up but I've lived in the US, Japan, Belgium, Denmark, UK, and Singapore. The US is where I spent the most amount of time, 3 years, other than Australia. After 16 my parents and I moved back to Australia and honestly I've never been unhappier. I know the sentiment is really rare, maybe it's because we lived in Southern California, but I genuinely loved living in the US. I made more friends there than I have anywhere else, it's been over 2 years and we all still keep in touch on the daily and call tons on weekends. The people I met there were really friendly and open, not to mention the blend of different cultures and having so many things to do was amazing.

When my family and I moved back to South Australia, I dropped out of high school and just started working at my local farm part time for the last year and a bit. Honestly I've lacked a lot of motivation and felt pretty lonely since coming back to Australia, it's like I was a different person in California. I am aware moving back doesn't mean my life will be perfect or like high school but I'd like to maybe live in the USA for just a year again to see if it's maybe a better path for my future and I can at least take some control over my life again. A lot of my friends go to Cal States and all live near each other, and honestly I just really want to move back to California.

I'm working on redoing my high school degree to join the green card lottery for 2026, but was wondering since the chances of that are low if there are any other options. Marrying is not an option as I am male and my best friends are all guys and I have not really kept in touch with any girls I had ever met in high school. I've researched a J-1 Visa but apparently they are only for 4 months and require you to go back to your home country for a minimum of two years after? A lot of the other Visas are for competitive job markets like Tech, I don't have a bachelor's degree and my only work experience is in farming and construction. Are there any other options for moving from Australia to the US? It's fine if it's for maybe just about a year, I just want to spend some time there since I'm young and I have decent savings from working for over a year and never spending my money.",2024-05-10T05:50:46+00:00

This will apply for the E-3 as well — it’s basically saying your degree will give you a specialty focus on one sector. So if you study finance, and get a job at an investment bank, that works.

(My dad moved me from living with my mom when I was 2 years old.) 

My first visit to the embassy I was told to tell them that I'm not aware of my moms whereabouts if asked and that's what I did. I didn't get the visa. 

Next visit my mom brought just me and not my brother. Didn't get the visa again. I was told to spend some more time in my country. I was 13 at that time. So I think they thought she was going to kidnap me or something being that “I don't know her whereabouts” then all of a sudden she just popped up.  

My latest visit I went by myself. They asked about my mom again and I told them I didn't know where she was. Visa not granted. So I figured that the issue is with my mom running off.   

Honestly, I'd like to apply again and be successful this time around. So I was wondering if anyone had any advice on my situation. Thank you in advance. ",2024-05-10T03:25:44+00:00

INA 322(a)(5) requires that the child maintain lawful status in the US. By enrolling in school, your child violated B-2 status. See 8 CFR 214.2(b)(7). Therefore, your Form N-600K will be denied.

**EDIT:** I wrote the text below assuming OP's child was still living in the United States. OP should disregard it.

Because your child lives in the US, she has another path to citizenship. File Forms I-130 and I-485 to get her a green card. Once the I-485 is approved, your will automatically become an American citizen. See INA 320. You would then get her a passport and file Form N-600 to get her a certificate of citizenship.

Your child is legally allowed to attend school while her Form I-485 is pending.

immigration,post,1cod3lc,Due-Mixture-1334,My wife and I decided to get married before our I-129F was approved. What next?,"TL;DR: My wife and I got married in the Philippines before our I-129F was approved. Do we cancel the I-129F and submit a new one with the I-130, or do we leave it and just submit the I-130?

For context, my wife and I submitted our I-129F after being told it would take about 3-6 months to process. After submitting, we were then told it would take over 15 months. Because of the long wait time, we decided to get married sooner rather than later, since I am in the military and moving around while waiting makes things more difficult to get her to the U.S. 

After our wedding, I knew I would have to submit the I-130 petition ASAP, but I’ve gotten mixed responses about the status of my I-129F after that. 

From a USCIS agent: “Don’t withdraw your I-129F after you get married. You’ll have to submit it all over again and this will save you money. Just submit the I-130.”

From ANOTHER USCIS agent: “Your I-129F will stop being processed once you get married. You’ll have to submit the I-130.”

From travel.state.gov (paraphrased): I have to submit the I-130 and I-129F and depending on which get approved first will determine the next steps going forward.

I’m getting a lot of mixed signals and considered getting an immigration attorney, but the fees they charge are out of my budget, so I’m not going to do that until I’ve expended all possible resources to getting the right information.

For anyone who’s gone through this process, what’s your experience, and if you did it in your own, what’s the best way to go do this?

It is very easy to accidentally make an innocent mistake that totally derails an application. A lawyer doesn't 100% guarantee this won't happen. But the professional experience should help avoid common pitfalls. And having another pair of eyes go over the application is absolutely worth it. 


Of course that still means you should check all the paperwork yourself as well. Anybody can make mistakes, even lawyers. So, everything should be double checked.

immigration,post,1co9e3c,Former_Flounder_2352,NVC Civil Documents,"NVC Pending Documents

Hello guys can anyone help me out here pls?

I’ve send my civil documents to the NVC, regarding ny EB-2 NIW and below I will describe the following events:

- EB-2 NIW Process 11/27/23 – Filing of I-140 Form application on USCIS. Priority Date: 11/27/23. 

- 03/15/24 – I-140 case approved directly without any request for additional evidence (RFE). 

- 03/15/24 – I-140 case approved directly without premium process. 03/20/24 – USCIS transferred the case to NVC and a welcome letter from the National Visa Center (NVC) was received 5 days after the I-140 approval. 

- The letter has instructions of all 7 steps required to be done by the applicant so it could get the interview schedules with U.S. Embassy or Consulate in Rio de Janeiro. Unfortunately, there were issues on the website to send the required civil documents: It was not possible to submit the documents online on the CEAC platform or by email. Also, there wasn’t even a button for that. So, what I did was to send all the documentation physically to NVC in Virginia by mail.

- After 2 weeks after I sent the mail, NVC reverted on 23th of April inddicating that my birth certificate was not valid. That said, on the same day as their response I went to the proper institution to require the valid/correct document requested and sent it to NVC and the document arrived on Thursday 04/05 at 19:28 AM

- After that it was total radio silence and send an enquiry on May 2nd asking the status of my case and then the NVC replied this: 

To Whom it Concerns (the printscreen is on the message as well)
 
A letter was sent to the agent of choice or attorney of record indicating the Immigrant Visa Application and/or civil document requirements for this case are incomplete.  Please submit the requested Immigrant Visa Application(s) and/or civil documents, as indicated on the checklist.  The requested information must be submitted to the NVC for this file to continue processing. For current processing times, please visit our website at https://nvc.state.gov/submit (English) or https://nvc.state.gov/submit/espanol (Spanish).

Finally. I’m completed lost now, because the timeframe of NVC to reply has already moved on to the date I sent the pending file and I didn’t get any response yet, just this answer to my enquiry.

Therefore, I would like the help of you guys on what to do like if they lost the document and I need to send it again or they still didn’t processed my case yet, because my process is through the US Consulate in Brazil Rio e Janeiro.

Guys thank you so much! Any help here is more then welcome!

Whish you all the best",2024-05-09T22:05:18+00:00

Since the divorce happened within a certain time period of the child's birth, the ex-husband is the legal father, but he is not the biological father. The biological father is a US citizen. Mother has sole custody.

Assuming there's clear and convincing evidence to support the claimed biological relationship, if the father goes to a notary official and swears under oath that he is the biological father and promises to support the child till 18, does the child automatically become a US citizen? Obviously, the bio dad and mom need to go through the Embassy process. But as a theoretical matter, the child's status would be US citizen right?

immigration,post,1co8ism,RareJewel12,Lawyer forgot to file our I-485 and we just lost an entire year.,"Our I-130 got approved last year in February. We had submitted our I-485 application a month after our approval. We visited the lawyers office to make sure everything was set in place and that we were good to go. My partner also had to get a motion filed to recalendar. Anyways, a few months had passed by and we were worried that we hadn't received any type of confirmation from the lawyer or USCIS or a court date, basically nothing. So we called the lawyers office and they reassured us that everything was going well and that our application is now with the judge. Another 6-7 months had passed and I had decided to call the office again and they told me that they haven't heard anything and told me not to worry. Fast forward to this year, I was getting really suspicious about our application so I called and had asked to tell me exactly what was going on since it's odd to not receive anything at all. This person told me that nothing had been filed and that the person who was in charge never even submitted our application or filed our motion. At this point, I was too mad and furious to even speak, react or get angry so I took a deep breath and kindly asked to please submit everything immediately. I later cried that my partner has just lost one year over something so simple and obvious. I feel like my partner could have gotten his greencard by now. But here we are back to square one. After this incident, I wonder how many lawyers have made these mistakes that has caused many to lose years in receiving their card. It's just really hard to accept all this. 

Does anyone know how long it takes to hear back after a motion has been filed to recalendar? Thanks and wish us luck! ",2024-05-09T21:27:26+00:00

immigration,comment,l3dtnma,Sleepy_Panda1478,,"I just wanted to clarify - it sounds like maybe your husband was in removal proceedings that were administratively closed to allow for your I-130 to be processed? And now you need your case recalendared so you can pursue your I-485 in front of the Immigration Judge? If that's the case, the bottleneck might be getting the case back on the active docket. A lot of immigration courts are so backed up that it can be really difficult to get a new hearing date, even if you are ready to move forward. If that's true where you are, it's at least possible that your lawyer wanted to wait on filing the I-485 until you were recalendared. If that's the case, it still might be worth seeing if you can get the case dismissed without prejudice so you can proceed before USCIS. Short answer, you need to figure out what's going on with the court case, but the delay in filing the I-485 may not have cost you all the time you think it has.

Instead they lied to us saying that our case was with the judge when a motion hadn't even been filed at that time.

The motion to recalendar got filed yesterday when it was supposed to be filed a little over year ago thus leading us to losing an entire year of wait time. Hope this clarifies.

I'm currently a conditional green card holder whose card recently expired. I've already applied to remove the conditions on my green card using Form I-751 and received the I-797 Notice of Action from USCIS. This notice confirms that my application is being processed and extends the validity of my green card (I-551) for 48 months, allowing me to work and travel.

However, since U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) handles entry into the country, I'm concerned about potential issues when re-entering the U.S. after traveling abroad. Has anyone here faced a similar situation? How did CBP handle your re-entry with the extended green card status?

Additionally, does anyone know how I might contact CBP to discuss this situation directly or get some form of written or oral confirmation that re-entry will not be problematic?

The DMV did not accept the notice as sufficient proof of my legal status due to the expired date on the green card.

You are fine traveling with it.

FYI: I went to DMV today again (NY) and they didn’t accept the expired card with the I-797.

immigration,comment,l3gwrvk,Fukayu,,"Ah that would be it. I was helping someone from NY as well and according to their form ID-44 (3/20) an expired permanent residents card can ONLY be used as date of birth verification. The only way to prove lawful permanent resident status is by using your foreign passport with  a valid I-551 stamp, through infopass.

Social security card (SSN) + foreign passport w/ I-551 stamp (Proof of Residence) + expired green card (Proof of DOB) gives you 8 points. Then use any documents in section C to qualify you for a REAL ID. I'm not very familiar with NY so I apologize if I provided any false info. Best if you consult with other e.g. AAA or DMV help lines.",2024-05-10T18:44:09+00:00
immigration,post,1co5w7s,BigMakondo,Half way through my H1-B CAP EXEMPT visa. My employer won't sponsor GC and companies won't interview me. What to do?,"Hi, I'm an MSc with 7 YoE who works at a well known company in NYC and I have Spanish and Italian citizenship. They sponsored an H1-B cap exempt visa for me, but I recently found out that they won't sponsor the PERM for the Green Card.

Cap exempt H1-B visas are only for research and non-profit companies, thus they can't be transferred to ""regular"" companies. 

**One solution** would be to get hired by a different regular company that would sponsor a regular cap subject H1-B visa. The **problem** is that the 6 years maximum duration of the H1-B is shared across the cap exempt and cap subject visas. 

Therefore, if a company hires me now, they would have to go through the lottery (1-2 years maybe even 3) after which I'd have only around a year or less left on the new H1-B visa. Which means, it would have to be a company that sponsors the GC from day one.

While there are companies that offer those and despite my relatively attractive profile, I am finding it very hard to get interviews because I can't start working right away, so companies won't take the risk, understandably so.

**A second solution** would be to apply to the GC myself, most likely through EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver). The problem is that I don't have a PhD and I'm not a researcher, so I don't have publications. Given that I am in a research place, I will  try to get some papers out. But even if I get some, enough citations are not  guaranteed. I think it's an overall risky avenue that would put me too close to my H1-B expiration date and that might not even work eventually.

**A third solution** would be to get hired by another research company (transferring the H1-B should be easier in this case) that would sponsor GC. I am gathering information about possible companies that do this because I don't know any, so **any leads would be appreciated**.

Do I have any other option to get the GC? Should I start mentally preparing to have to go back? Should I consider going to Canada (no idea if it's harder or easier) to have access to similar jobs?",2024-05-09T19:37:54+00:00

I have a friend who has 4 children, ages 15 and 10, 3 of them are triplets, who were born in the US, and are citizens. The mother and children  went to live in Mexico, and the father stayed in the united states. After a while, he left to move to mexico with his wife and children. He was apparently,  poisoned and spent alot of time in the hospital.  Once he left the hospital,  he was told he couldn't come in the house, and was met by the wife with her new lover. Time passed, and would see his kids from time to time. My friends ex wife, is part of a family with money, and family members that would threaten the father. 

Long story short, the mother passed away, and her sister(the aunt)took the 4 children, and is keeping them  in a house, but no one knows where. They have alot of properties, and money, and are trying some funny business in Mexico, paying ppl off, but some mail recently sent out, seems to now show where the aunts mailing address is at.

The father is in the united states now...and is wondering if there is anything he can do, to get his children back?

Because the children have been living in Mexico for a long time, Mexican family/child custody laws apply and US laws for the most part, are completely inapplicable. 

It's also irrelevant that the children are US citizens, just because they are US citizens does not mean that they need to be living in/returned to the US; it depends on the custody laws of their current state/country of residence.

Once the children reach the age of majority (18 in Mexico), they can decide for themselves whether they want to stay in Mexico or move to the US. Custody laws no longer apply.",2024-05-09T17:15:46+00:00

immigration,comment,l3b6zj8,not_an_immi_lawyer,,"No, this is not child abduction.

While they're married, either parent is allowed to travel with the child. 

If the father does not consent to the child traveling, and believes the child to be abducted, they must then file a court action (typically within 6 months - 1 year) to compel the child to be returned to the child's state of residence. If the mother then fails to return the child, that would now qualify as child abduction.

However, it sounds like 6 months has long since passed. The child is now a resident of Mexico (specifically, the Mexican state), and any order to ""return the child to their state of residence"" would be of no effect, since the child is already living in their state of residence.

The father must now apply to obtain custody in the Mexican courts. If the father in fact attempts to bring the children back to the US without custody or the permission of their current legal guardian, he may be committing international child abduction.",2024-05-09T17:34:32+00:00

immigration,comment,l3brpng,not_an_immi_lawyer,,"All of that isn't relevant, except the ""mini militia and took the kids by force"" bit.

This is because:

1. Courts usually don't want to disrupt the children's current established lives. It does more harm to the children to significantly disrupt their established lives (that they've lived for 6-12+ months), regardless of who is right or wrong. The father should have sought custody long, long ago; his inaction may in fact count against him.

2. The mini militia comment is concerning. Ultimately, can Mexican courts even enforce their ruling on this sister? If not, this is all moot - there's no point suing and winning if the win means nothing. The US won't be sending soldiers to enforce a Mexican court custody order.

He should definitely still hire a Mexican family lawyer, but don't be surprised if the answer is ""wait till the kids are adults, then have them move out of their own volition"".",2024-05-09T19:33:35+00:00

Crazy to say this when you're the one explicitly connecting ethnicity with nationality

Not a country

A country famous for having dozens of regional ethnicities. At least say Han Chinese, then your argument would make a bit more sense

You've just listed four groups in an attempt to argue a connection between national identity and ethnicity. Cmon now

At best a language group. Also, there isn't a single Slavic country so it doesn't match with what you're saying

immigration,comment,l3ez0o6,MissAuroraRed,,"Americans are very individualistic, and have a lot of respect for a ""self made"" personal development story. Nobody cares if your parents are nobodies, as long as *you* are a respectable person. 

We have more horizontal hierarchies in business environments. Decision making is not as ""top down"" as other countries, and we like a junior employee who speaks up and has fresh ideas. 

We value our time. This has a lot of other implications such as it being rude to waste another person's time, so we are very direct communicators. Especially at work, if you try to have a meeting the French way with 20 minutes of coffee and chit-chat at the beginning, it will annoy people.

We're a ""safe to try"" culture. If you try to do something and it doesn't work out, you still get a pat on the back for having the courage to try your best despite the risk of failure. 

Overall we're pretty laid back and don't care for stuffy formalities in our daily lives. As another Redditer said, just chillin' and grillin' will get you pretty far.

The only universally shared American cultural habits/values that differ from other countries are the ones that are structurally enforced by laws/official practices/infrastructure/etc. For example it's American culture follow traffic lights and drive only on properly marked roadways because you have to, whereas in other countries the driving culture could be vastly different. Same for speaking English, not bargaining with shopkeepers, etc. Even the speaking English thing is not really universal, in many parts of the US the structural factors are such that people don't know English and don't need to. 

For pretty much any other value you rattle off (like ""individualism"", ""respect"", ""patriotism"", ""secularism"", ""openness"", ""watching TV"", etc.) even if it's statistically common you can find myriad born-and-raised Americans, usually in your immediate vicinity, who do not by any means espouse that value, to the point that it doesn't make any sense as a factor distinguishing Americans from non-Americans. Maybe you're not aware of the diversity of the country you live in because you live in a social bubble of like-minded people, but it is absurd to think that a whole country shares a personality trait.",2024-05-10T03:31:57+00:00

immigration,comment,l3cxmbx,Fine-Tie2651,,"This is an utterly wrong take. There is very much such a thing as American values and culture, just because it varies slightly differently from place to place doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Californians may lean towards more liberal values, while southerners may lean towards more conservative values. But at the same time, Americans mostly commonly agree on fundamental values like freedom, freedom of expression, patriotism, and more. Therefore, America forms a nation which is a people with a common set of fundamental values. When you take someone from India and put them next to an average america, you’ll find that they generally differ in their worldviews, mannerisms, customs etc. These differences signify the existence of an Indian culture and consequently an American culture. An absence of culture would be characterized by absolute chaos, which is generally not true in the United States. 

You know, by comparison, India is full of different languages and worldviews and cultures, but this doesn’t mean that Indian culture doesn’t exist. Consequently, the same logic also doesn’t mean that American culture doesn’t exist.",2024-05-09T23:48:00+00:00

immigration,comment,l3e8mu2,VerifiedMother,,"I'm a native born American, and I also like to complain, so I would genuinely love to address your comment 

I am appreciative of a lot of the opportunities that I've had growing up in what is by far the biggest 1st world country by area and population-wise

Public education in America is generally pretty good even though there are attacks in a lot of states over the past few years to defund education and it's paid for all by taxes up until college. I'm by far the most knowledgeable about education because my parents and multiple other family members were teachers and I'm a paraprofessional while finishing up my undergrad 

If you're looking for a job with a high salary, you legitimately can't do any better than the US, doctors make more money here than anywhere else. If you're in tech, engineers and software devs make double or higher the salary you could make pretty much anywhere else in the world and having access to this job market without having to hope for a company to sponsor you for a visa is definitely awesome. 

On the other hand, the US has major issues with things like healthcare affordability. We're a capitalist country so if you are rich and you want to pay for extras in a hospital like a private room or different doctor or whatever, then I absolutely believe that you should be able to do that. But if you're poor and you need medical attention, everyone should absolutely be able to get a base level of medical care like a couple of years ago I fell off my onewheel (basically a motorized skateboard) and I required months of physical therapy to get to where I could walk without massive amounts of pain and even today it still hurts on occasion, if I wasn't lucky enough to have good insurance, I probably wouldn't have done any physical therapy.

Gun violence: gun deaths in the US are like 6x the rate of the next highest 1st world country which happens to be our maple syrup loving neighbors to the North and literally dozens of times higher than pretty much any European country, I live in Idaho which ironically even though it's super gun friendly has one of the lowest rates of gun homicide but we still have like 3x the national rate of gun deaths as Canada.

Criminal justice: we just have way too many people in prison, covid actually helped this to an extent, a lot of non-violent offenders were released and that genuinely makes me happy, The system doesn't do a good job of rehabilitation though even though we spend a TON of money on prisoners.  Between states and the federal prisons, we spend 80 billion dollars a year housing inmates, the US state department only gets 40 billion a year. We therefore value keeping people in a box twice as much as we do on foreign relations to every other country in the world. 

I could keep going but I'm not going to.

I genuinely really like the US but I also have eyeballs see that we could do a lot better, 

But one of the rights we get in the constitution is freedom of speech, I can criticize the hell out of the government and as long as it isn't blatantly wrong, that is protected speech (although in reality, this is violated way more often than it should be, ala the arrests of students on campuses recently for pro-Palestinian protests)",2024-05-10T06:02:56+00:00

Many of the cultures have been incorporated so fully that we think of their contributions as fully American and not Italian, Jewish, Mexican, or Chinese. While some contributions seem like they come from other cultures but are really American. Others are a hodgepodge from many cultures.

immigration,comment,l3d33db,Fine-Tie2651,,"Well, you could actually just describe American culture as a catch all statement for all of these subcultures (west, south, Mideast, etc.). No country has one uniform culture. As I mentioned India, someone from guajarat might vary from Punjab, but it’s still Indian culture. Consequently, an American from Boston might differ from someone who grew up in California but they’re still immersed in the American culture. As for defining American culture, America is a bit of an extension of British culture and it seems to have been defined by its succession from Britain and thus its patriotic ideals. You could also define it as the collection of American achievements whether it be through science, art, pop culture, etc. You can also define American culture through mannerisms, accents, customs, courtesies, etc. Just because people disagree on political issues doesn’t mean that American culture doesn’t exist. That’s silly. What matters is that people agree on the fundamentals, which most people seem to. Such values I would say are primarily based off of Judeo-Christian values. But more importantly, freedom, patriotism, freedom of expression, and democracy are the biggest ones. You know, I live in Canada and it’s very easy to see the difference in culture between my country and the USA. When I cross the border, immediately I’ll notice that the states is far more patriotic than Canada as evidenced by the American flags flying everywhere on businesses, cars, buildings. 

Lastly, again, you mention a lot of disagreements between many Americans and thus you believe that because people disagree on these issues, then American culture doesn’t exist. Just because people disagree on issues of abortion doesn’t mean that American culture doesn’t exist. Every country has disagreements among the population of varying sorts, but it doesn’t mean that culture doesn’t exist nor does it invalidate other American subcultures. You could argue that the amount of disagreement between Americans is American culture.

first: I know that asking reddit suboptimal and the best thing would be to go on official platforms and do my own research. However, as of now I am in the beginning of having these thoughts and any action would be a few years later anyway.

I am currently studying a STEM subject as a Master's degree in Germany. In the long term, I would like to move to the US and also becoming a citizen. Rather sooner than later. From my limited research, I have heard that doing a PhD (in my case a STEM PhD) in the US can elevate chances to obtain a green card significantly. I am open to do this in principle. There are a few topics I find very interesting that I could see myself doing a PhD in. However, I do not see myself in academia in the long term. If I were to stay in Germany, I would go into industry immediately after obtaining my Master's Degree. The idea would be to try to come to the USA a few years later after having obtained a good amount of work experience so that I am skilled enough for a US company to sponsor me. That seems to take so much longer, though. I see my future in the USA and would therefore like to have this burden behind me as soon as possible.  
**TLDR: What maximizes the probability of obtaining US citizenship after obtaining a STEM Master from Germany? PhD in USA vs. Working in Germany and coming later? Which would be faster?**

And by the way, please do not make this thread about whether I really want to go to the USA and the downsides in comparison to Europe. There are enough other threads discussing this question.",2024-05-09T14:52:31+00:00

immigration,comment,l3ar31j,Grim-Sleeper,,"It's a slow process, and while theoretically possible to directly apply for a green card, you are much more likely to go through a bunch of different visa types before you get a chance to start this process. And even then, it still takes years to get citizenship.

As a student, you could transfer to a US university on an F1 visa, or you could do an internship with a company on a J1. Neither of these two visas get you a direct path to citizenship, but they might be part of the journey. You can then work on finding somebody to sponsor you for an H1B. If going into private industry, there is a lottery as these visas are oversubscribed. So, no guarantees. But some universities and/or non-profits are exempt from the quota. So, that might be a way to extend your stay after the F1 or J1 has run out.

You can also look into an OPT after your studies, as that can buy you some time.

Ultimately, you need to find a sponsor for your green card. None of these visas are generally something you can do yourself. They have to be applied for by somebody else on your behalf, and that organization also has to pay for it. As the process can cost tens of thousands of dollars and take months or years to complete, it's not easy to find sponsors unless you can demonstrate extremely unique and desirable skills.

A national-interest green card is a possibility, if you are truly exceptional. This usually requires a PhD and a larger number of publications. It's one of the few visa types that you can apply for on your own.

Alternatively, green card through marriage to a US citizen is another option, but requires sufficient financial means at the time of the application.

And whatever you do, before obtaining US citizenship, you should file for a German ""Beibehaltungsgenehmigung"". This **must** happen before you get US citizenship",2024-05-09T16:01:30+00:00

immigration,comment,l3clsc4,just-add-caffeine,,"If you do a STEM PhD in the US (be aware that PhDs in the US are typically 1-2 years longer than in Germany) you get a total of 3 years of OPT, a post-completion employment authorization. Essentially you want to be with an employer during that time that either directly sponsors your Green Card or an H1B work visa - a lottery with a 20% chance of winning that only happens once a year. The H1B would give you 6 more years to find an employer to sponsor your GC or for you qualify for self-sponsorship in EB2-NIW or EB1A. This is the most common strategy right now, I think.

Working abroad and then trying to find a job in the US faces more headwinds. Conventional wisdom is that companies rarely choose to sponsor Green Cards for people from abroad, also picking up H1B sponsorship seems less likely from abroad than if you would already work in the US. So working for an employer that also has a footprint in the US and then getting transferred with an L1 visa is the most likely scenario. 

There are other pathways, too, like doing a PhD in Germany, getting to the US as a J1 researcher for up to 5 years, and then go for a green card (with an optional step of switching to an academic H1B that is not subject to the lottery and can sponsor anytime).

My 10-year US B1/B2 Visa (used primarily for business or B1) expires towards the end of August, 2024

I am an Indian Citizen moving to Toronto, Canada as a Permanent Resident (PR-Card) next month.

(As my flights and lodging are already booked for early June, I do not have time to go through this renewal process in India.)

Could someone who has gone through the US B1/B2 Visa Renewal process in Canada please help me with answers to a few questions?

1.  How long does this process take when applying from Canada?

2. Are interviews mandated?  (I raise absolutely no red-flags. Never refused a VISA for any country, Never Overstayed any VISA in any country, Never Deported, Several other VISAs (Tourist and Business) to EU, UK, Japan, New Zealand, etc.  Travelled quite frequently pre-COVID.  The only potential issue may be that I would be applying for this B1/B2 VISA renewal in my 2nd month in Canada.)

3. If interviews can not be waived, how much time does this add to the estimated turn-around-time?  
  
4. As the visa is B1/B2, can I renew it via the Tourist Visa renewal process to get the same B1/B2 visa extended?  (Alternatively, I will request the necessary documentation from my employer.)

Roughly over 10 years ago, I was visiting Dallas, Texas as a snowbird visiting from up north and on a night out in a chaotic bar/Nightclub I was approached by individuals called ICE after conversing with gentleman who I had no idea who'm with they were or what they were about.... I was a tourist, I was young 19 at the time, it was fun, we were talking about cow girls, drinks, horses, etc.

Basically the next morning I have no idea how these ""ICE"" people showed up at my door of my AIRBNB rental and took me into custody? and then to an immigration center.... I was probably the only Canadian in that entire building/facility.. None of the immigrants or refugees could comprehend why I was there, I could not comprehend why I was there...

I was arrested at the time because the gentlemen or cow boys I was speaking to were involved in things I can't even fathom that I was oblivious to like cross border immigration, and basically things from the breaking bad show O\_O.. I had tanned skin and could pass for a Latino so without any hesitation I was snatched up and held against my will for allegedly being a part of some... idk? organization or something...

Weeks go by after being detained and the canadian government came to my rescue, all allegations and potential charges of I don't even know what they were anymore ( Conspiracy to commit acts of crime or something ? ) They were all dropped against me and I was free the next morning.

There was a catch though... The defender? or the Prosecutor or whatever, he wanted to make sure that although I was at the time proven not guilty or what (  I WASN'T GUILTY OF ANYTHING!!!!!

A decade ago, there was a US embassy where people had their US passports taken away arbitrarily. Most, if not all, the people were part of one minority group. The OIG issued a report with some recommendations and if I remember correctly, State agreed to implement them. Still, knowing the history of the State Department it is difficult to trust them. 

I want to avoid a situation where I'm stuck outside by own country because of some dumbass consular officer. Most of them aren't bad, but it only takes one to ruin you.

Unless you work in a field that qualifies for visas, very difficult.

> My husband grew up in the states and was a permanent resident for 11 years before coming back to Canada. He had a social security # and did work in the states. Does this bode well in our favor?

Did he naturalize? How long ago did he leave the US? Your best hope here is that your husband is either a citizen or has been gone for a short enough period of time that he hasn't abandoned his green card.

> My sister in law has lived in the states for 21 years, and is a permanent resident. To sponsor us, she will be getting her citizenship in about 3 weeks. In order to sponsor us, does she have to have her citizenship for a certain period of time?

No, but it will take two or three *decades* to get a visa through your sister-in-law.

> My mother in law also has her citizenship but does not live in the states full time - would she still be able to sponsor us?

She would need to live in the states full time and it would still take decades, just slightly less time than it will take through your sister-in-law.

I will be going to New York as a paid work-trip to undergo training for my graduate job for 2 weeks in July. I'm an EU citizen residing in London, where my job is.

The trip will be completely subsidised by my employer, that is to say the air fare, hotel/lodging, and a per diem meal stipend. As far as I know, insurance is also covered on these trips.

Will it be sufficient if I have around US$1000 in my bank account as spending money? I know border control can be a bit iffy about low sums but considering that everything is paid for, this should be okay if any questions are asked?

I have a previous F1 visa as well as a valid B1/B2 in an expired passport that was set to expire in September 2024, but I wanted to it get renewed now because I have lots of travel planned until then and didn’t want to tie up my passport.

I had submitted both passports (you have to submit all valid visas), but when I got them back with the refusal slip, I saw that they had cancelled the valid B1/B2 visa with a CWOP (Cancelled Without Prejudice) stamp. This made me nervous.


The process (skip for interview questions below):

The Delhi Embassy experience was subpar at best. It was hot and somewhat disorganized, but this could be because there were a TON of applicants. I walked in at around 8:40 AM and it was already very crowded.

I left my bag, phone and all other electronics with a friend who had a car, and only took inside a folder with pertinent business and financial documents.

When I entered the embassy, I was put in line with everyone going in for a scheduled interview. There was no separate line or provision for walk-ins. The security guard simply saw “Before 10AM” on the paper and lined me up with the rest. When I asked if I could bypass them because I was a walk-in, he said no. There was no one else to talk to outside.

I went through two security checks and was led to a waiting area with the rest of the applicants. The room was packed. Once again I asked the staff members there if I could walk in straight away and they said no, and I was seated with everyone else. I only saw one other person with a walk-in slip who was also waiting, the rest were fresh applicants. The intake was extremely slow, with a total wait time of around 45 minutes. Those around me who had specific interview times were delayed as well.

Row by row, we were led from the waiting area to inside the building and lined up to the first set of counters where they were checking documents. I handed in my passport and 221(g) slip, and the lady scanned the barcode (that the VAC had stuck on my passport upon dropbox submission) and asked me to go to a specific counter (9) for my interview. She kept the 221(g) slip and gave me back my passport.

Then I was sent to another line for the next counters where the visa interviews were taking place. I told one of the staff members that I had to be at counter 9. She took me out of line and asked me to stand by counter 9, where someone was in the middle of their interview. Once they were done, the Visa Officer (VO) at the counter said “next” and I stepped up.



The interview:

VO: Why are you travelling to the US?

Me: Mainly for tourism, but I have a client meeting as well

VO: And I see that you’re going for 4 weeks? (as listed on DS-160)

Me: Actually, now it will be about 2.5-3 weeks because I have to be back for my Mom’s surgery

VO: Do you work for a company?

ME: Nope, I have my own business

VO: Oh okay, what kind of business is it?

ME: (described my business)

VO: How long have you had this business for?

ME: About 4 years now

VO: And who is this client? What are you going to do for them?

ME: (described my client and the project)

VO: Okay, I see that you visited the US for about 7 weeks in December. What was the purpose of this visit?

ME: I had business meetings. I had several meetings during that time in different states

VO: How many meetings did you have?

ME: 5 meetings, but 3 of them turned into clients

VO: And who are these clients?

ME: (described the clients)

VO: (looking at the screen) I see that you tried to apply for a student visa as well?

ME: Yes I did, I studied there

VO: (her demeanor became friendlier) Oh you did? What did you study?

ME: (described my field of study)

VO: It’s interesting that you studied ____ and now you’re doing ____

ME: (I chuckled) I know, right? It still falls under the general business field but I guess that’s just how life worked out!

VO: Your visa is approved and will be sent to your selected delivery method

ME: Great! Do you need to keep both passports? (They had been tied with a rubber band by the Mumbai VAC)

VO: Nope, you can keep this one (she separated them and gave me back the older passport with the cancelled visa)

ME: Okay, thanks, have a nice day!

VO: You too



My thoughts:

While I thought that the reason I was being called in was to clarify financial details and proof of funds, she didn’t ask me a single question about finances or income. However, she did request specific details about work and US clients (probably because I’m self-employed), and was curious about why I was in the US for that long in December. She likely wanted to determine that I only have temporary reasons to visit the US.

She seemed friendly but was doing her job. My recommendation is to try to stay calm and be conversational. Be clear, add some context where necessary but don’t overload them with information.

Good luck to everyone applying! Happy to answer any questions if needed :)

For the PERM we would advertise through niche websites, obscure radio stations, min wage etc. whatever our lawyer could come up with that is least likely to attract US applicants. The job doesn’t have that many requirements besides from - being physically fit, not overly small, minimum age of 18, drivers license? That’s really it. I don’t think it would be that difficult to pass the perm abusing all loopholes or am I ignorant?

However, if you have travelled to Western countries, bring evidence of those visas, especially countries like Australia, the UK, or the EU.

She cannot file for Adjustment of Status (I-485 and other forms) because both her and fiance have no money.    

Q1.  What does she need to know about trying to adjust her status after 90 days?    
(Please assume she has no way to file within the 90 days).     

Q2.  Will she need a lawyer for this?   What does she need to know about it - can she still do it and receive green card?   

Q3.  If the couple has no savings and very low income, what will happen?  Will that block her from being able to get the green card?   
He has house and car and a few assets, then very low income right now, and a lot of debt.  Financially they are both not good - she and her family have nothing and are from poor country.      
     
Can she still get her green card if he is very low income?  Assuming they get the $2000 or so needed to file the papers (but after the 90 days).

________________________________________________     
**Abuse**    
   
Q4.  What are the immigration issues related to him being abusive to her?  Physically and other ways.   She wants to stay in the US and marry him, despite how he is.        

Q4. Would she have to wait until after her interview to separate or divorce, if she wants to be able to stay in the US?   Or she needs to wait until she receives GC in the mail?      

Obviously this is a bad situation.  Physically abusive.  He won't let her have a cell phone, go out of the house without him, go for a walk, etc.  It's as bad as you can imagine.  He won't give her any money at all.  He makes sure he reads her social media text messages.  I won't get into full the details, but have thought she should flee him and go to a women's shelter.  Also, she has no money to buy a ticket him, and he also does not.  (I think she would be able to fly home anyway, if needed).  Her choice is to stay and get married and try to get a green card.   Again, here with no friends, isolated by him, no money, no cell phone with cell service, but can text on wifi, no access to needed health care, forced to clean and cook, etc.  

Q5.  What resources are available to help her deal with being trapped in abusive situation?  She knows nothing about the US and he is not teaching her anything.     

Q6.  What advice do any of you have who have been in this situation (here on K1 visa but being abuse) or know someone who has gone through this.     

Extra info:   
I am her only contact in the US, and am located within a drive to them.  I don't know him.  This is first time for me to know someone who did this - almost buys a slave wife, uses relatives/men in her family to control her, keep her powerless and scared.  It's awful, but I think many American guys have done this.  She has no possibility back home to ever get a good job or leave extreme poverty. She is young.

immigration,comment,l39z0dn,Forsaken-Smell-8665,,"1+2) For the K1 you are required to marry and adjust the status within 90 days or she will be required to go home and apply through consular processing. 
To find a loop hole or justifiable reason to not do it within 90 days, that would most likely need to be done through an immigration lawyer which will be very expensive. 
But if all done before the 90 days, no lawyer should be needed. 

3) Her husband (once married) will need to submit the I-864 Affidavit of Support which looks into the financials. He'll need to be in a job 125% of the poverty line, which for 2024 and for just a couple (no kids) is $25,550 per year. He'll have to submit 6 months of paystubs, 3 years worth of tax returns and any other assets to try get past that threshold. 
If he can't, he'll need to get a secondary sponsor... like another family member. 

4) I can't answer in terms of abuse wise. But in terms of divorce and staying in the US. 
She will be on a conditional green card which is valid for 2 years. At the end of the 2 year point, she will have to apply to get those conditions taken away and get a 10 year green card. Part of that is further evidence proving the marriage is still bona-fide and good.

immigration,post,1cnkuqx,Key-Parfait-6046,B2 Visa in Colombia to hike the Pacific Crest Trail,"Hi - I am planning to thruhike the Pacific Crest Trail in a couple of years.  This will be my first thruhike and I really do not want to do it alone. It will take close to six months to complete.

My potential hiking partner is a friend of mine in Colombia. She owns a house and her own business which gives her a good income.  She can easily save up to cover her gear and the cost of the trip.

In addition to her property, she has a mother who depends on her for everything and a son with mental illness who realistically will never be able live on his own.  

I will be using the hike to raise awareness and money for children with mental health issues (my son is on the spectrum).  Her interview will likely be in February of 2026.  By that time my partner and I are planning a presence on social media to start publicizing my efforts and may likely have a GoFundMe page to help with my expenses.

She (my hiking partner) is thinking about doing something similar in Bogota.

I am worried that if she does not mention me, talking about a remote hike from Mexico to Canada will sound like a plan to overstay.

But if she does mention me, the examiner will likely assume there is more to our friendship than there is and deny the visa on that basis.

Is there anything she can do to strengthen her case?

immigration,comment,l37wcel,IronLunchBox,,"That's a shame. If she were to naturalize before you turn 18, you'd probably acquire citizenship but that's highly fact dependent. You said she let your visa expire, so I assume you were admitted into the U.S. If she were to naturalize after you turn 18 but way before you turn 21 (assuming you stay unmarried) she could adjust you as an immediate family member using that lawful entry. There are options but the best ones rely on her naturalizing ASAP. 

Assuming you don't have money for a private consultation, reach out to a non-profit like KIND (maybe, since they focus on removal cases) or Catholic Charities and bring your mom to the consult. 

They should talk through your options with her. Hopefully they could convince her to natz and there may be a waiver or some grant money that could cover the filing fee. Non-profits usually charge a lot less than a private attorney.",2024-05-09T01:20:18+00:00

Waiver of Visa Requirement for Child Born to LPR Abroad

In general, when the LPR is entering the U.S. after travel abroad, the individual must present a valid travel document, such as an immigrant visa, a valid unexpired form I-551 (i.e., green card), an I-551 stamp, or reentry permit. However, this requirement is waived for a child born to an LPR during a temporary visit abroad if certain conditions are met. Mainly, the child must accompany the LPR parent on their first return trip to the U.S. following the child’s birth, and the child must enter the United States within 2 years of birth. Additionally, both the LPR parent and the child must be admissible to the United States.

Child Becomes LPR upon Admission to the United States
A child born abroad to an LPR parent is not automatically an LPR. Rather, when the child enters the U.S., the officer at the port of entry will complete a memorandum of creation of record of admission for lawful permanent residence (form I-181) for the child. The child then becomes an LPR upon admission to the U.S.",2024-05-09T13:35:53+00:00

immigration,comment,l3fzusf,AbleMathematician758,,"Is it possible you did get a green card after your last entry but you were too young to remember the interview or maybe there was no interview and they just sent it by mail. If you entered on a B2 visa and your permit was valid(not the visa itself), when you enter a B2 visa they usually give you a permit for 6 months. If she had filed a petition I-130 for you prior to that, and your priority date was current when that 6 month permit was still valid, you could’ve gotten your green card very quickly in the mail without an interview thru AOS.

A lot of people do that where they don’t enter USA until their priority date is current because to file AOS (adjustment of status, which is a green card without leaving USA) then you need to submit it while your 6 month permit is still valid. If the permit expires then you must do “consular processing” which is when you go to your country for the green card. 

For example, my mom’s friend had a petition that took 3 years to be current, she was living in Mexico while she waited, once her priority date was current she entered with her B2 visa and filed the AOS before the 6 month permit expired. 

This only applies because your mom is a green card holder, if she was a U.S. citizen then it wouldn’t matter if your permit and visa expired as long as you entered legally and you’re under 21. 

I’m only asking if it’s possible that she doesn’t want you to know about your green card since you’re stating your mom hides all your documents.",2024-05-10T15:27:43+00:00

Ex. What immigration options are available or what option did you/someone you know take? (Ex. Working visa, purchasing foreign property, marriage to US citizen, etc.).  How long was the process? Financial investment / legal fees? Etc.

immigration,post,1cneu7p,Fun-Show9424,help regarding education ,"Hey everyone, I'm seeking advice on educational opportunities in the USA as a new green card holder. I'm Sudanese, currently studying at a university in Saudi Arabia, and I haven't completed my bachelor's degree yet. My plan is to get my green card, secure a re-entry permit, return to Saudi Arabia to finish my studies, and then move to the USA permanently. I'm also planning to rent an apartment and find a job once I'm there.

My question is about my educational options in the USA as a green card holder during the first few months of my arrival. Can I apply to universities or community colleges? I'm interested in aeronautical science, and before I received my DV-25 acceptance, I got an email from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, offering me a spot in their aeronautical science program. However, the cost was too high—$60,000 per year for four years—which is almost 900,000 Saudi Riyals. I can't afford that without a scholarship.

I've also considered attending a flight academy in Florida called Paris Air. They offer a private pilot license for $13,000 to international students, but I'm curious if prices differ for green card holders.

If anyone has experience or advice on educational pathways and potential scholarships or financial aid for green card holders in the USA, I'd appreciate your insights. Thanks!",2024-05-08T20:42:02+00:00

2) Should I apply for STEM OPT extension through Checkr under premium processing and since there’s a guarantee that it’ll be done within 30 calendar days, I’ll be able to get it within 10th June or is this risky?

If they're dedicated, they can certainly move to those countries one by one, learn the language, spend 5-10 years there to grant citizenship to the spouse, then uproot their lives to acquire the next citizenship. It would be fairly insane, but definitely doable.

I have a trip next month to Mexico. I’m currently waiting for my green card, (I have an expired gc and expired extension letters) I was issued an ADIT Stamp (I-551 Stamp on an I-94 Form) to prove my Permanent Residency. I was told by the USCIS Officer that the stamp was valid for entry to Mexico but I’ve read mixed experiences online of people getting denied entry.

The Mexican consulate in my area is not responding to calls. Do I need a Tourist Visa?

The stamp is equivalent to the green card according to USCIS but will this be enough for boarding and entry to Mexico?

I have previously been to the US multiple times, all on different types of visas (mostly being A and J type). Last one was a J1 with the 2 year rule that has now passed. On all occasions I have returned either when it was stated on the paperwork or even earlier. Never did use the grace period allowed as I had no need nor did I want to. 

For the last 4 years I have been employed by my government and hold a very stable position in it, with a fairly good salary. Also, since the start of 2023 I have been to Austria, Croatia, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Hungary, Greece, Albania and Montenegro. I am also single, own a couple of dogs, a motorcycle and live in my parents house (they live in another european country).

We’ll be getting married this summer and getting the CR1 process going. Pretty aware of the potential wait around that, so my question is, can we spend extended periods of time in both countries while it processes? 

With the (at their discretion) general idea of the 6 months in Canada and the US allowed every 365 day window, our thought was to, after we’ve started the application process, spend ~4 months in the states, 4 months in Canada and if needed, file a visitor extension in Canada (or spend a couple months abroad), and if it’s still not done, spend time back down in the states. once the CR1 process is done, we’ll  settle down in the states. Our finances allow us to not work while in the other countries. 

Is there any obvious “it won’t work because of XYZ” here? I know visitor extensions and general access at the border is always at their discretion, so mostly wondering if/what major restrictions exist for her WHILE the CR1 is processing.  Thanks friends ",2024-05-08T18:21:44+00:00

We are both currently living in Mexico. My concern is  that my wife was in the US  before because she was brought in as a child.  She didn't know she was undocumented until she got close to her 18th birthday. She didn't have daca status. She left to Mexico roughly 10 days after her 18th birthday so my understanding is that she left within the 180 days  from accruing the unlawful presence ban. My concern is what kind of documentation can she provide so to show she really left the US shortly after her 18th birthday. My biggest fear is her getting her process denied due to the consular officer thinking she actually left 180 days after her 18th bday. She has her INE and driver's license which shows the issue date but not sure if that is good enough to prove she left timely. She is 24 now and has multiple jobs in Mexico as well so I'm hoping that can help prove that she was actually in Mexico. Not sure what other documentation we can provide to prove this.

Here is the regulation that makes that clear (""you"" in the language is the consular officer and I made it bold).  In other words, you do not need to worry about that.  

I am not sure I recall how they are scheduling K1 appointments in Dublin (normally they send you a check list of items to prepare/complete including the medical and then once that is done you let them know you are ready and they schedule you although maybe check out this nfo: https://ais.usvisa-info.com/en-ie/iv/information/k\_visa), but its best to have the medical done before the interview or they will have to refuse the case 221g until the medical is completed.

You may run into issues doing that. If you don't work for your employer, and they decide the job is no longer available to you, you will not be able to adjust status based on the EB-1 petition.

immigration,post,1cn5tz5,Riverside_sunset,What is the solution for me and my boyfriend? ,"
Hi all, this will be a long post, but we’re really stuck and could use some help if possible.. thanks for staying and reading! 

So, me (23F) and my boyfriend (27M) has been dating for a year now. We’re both Vietnamese, I live it Viet Nam, he grew up in the US with a US passport. He came to Viet Nam twice to visit me and I’ve came to the US 2 times, and the last time was still by the travel visa, but to visit him. I’m planning to come visit him again this summer, and we plan to take our relationship to the next level, but here’s where I need some advice with: 

1. We want to get engaged and then apply for the K1 Visa, but then I still have approximately around one more year of school that I need to finish here. So by the time I finish school, will I be able to have the K1 Visa, assuming that Joe Biden might step down by the end of this year, and can I come to the US after I finish school? And will I be able to sign up for a green card with the K1 visa? 

2. A friend told us to apply for a marriage certificate, and a green card after that. But with that case, I’ll have to stay in the US for a longer time than I planned my trip to be, plus, from my research, I won’t be able to leave the US more than 6 months per year after that? So I think this option wouldn’t work for us? 

I’m sorry for this long post, we’re just very exhausted with all the research and to find the best solution.. If you have and recommendations or suggestions, please let us know. If not then it’s completely fine, I’m just venting about how stressful it is. Thanks all, have a nice day!

K1 will take 1-1.5 years from the date of filing to process. If you get the K1 visa, you will need to move to the US and get married to your boyfriend within 90 days and you can file for green card (also called adjustment of status or AOS). The AOS processing could take an additional 6 months to 1 year, but you won't be able to work or leave the US until you get your Employment Authorization Document (EAD) and Advance Parole (AP) approved (this can also take 2-3 months) ,or you get your green card.

So I think this option wouldn’t work for us?

In that case, you both can get married outside of the US (in your home country), then he can go back and directly file a green card (also called CR1)  for you using I-130 while you remain in Vietnam. It can take upto 1-2 years, and you will need to attend an interview at the US embassy in Vietnam, but once it is approved, you will get a green card directly in your home country, and you can enter the US as a green card holder and immediately start working/studying/anything else. However, as a green card holder, you cannot remain outside the US for more than 6 months at a time in a year. Once you have been married to him and have held a green card for 3 years, you can apply for US citizenship.

It's legal, but no, many firms do not hire that way. Unless you're one of the handful of countries with a treaty option, which the UK isn't, then there isn't a reliable, fast, or cost-effective way to get the employee to the US. It's simply not worth the time and money for the kinds of positions you'd be looking for.

> Or am I better off getting a job in a US headquartered firm and getting transferred internally?

This is the only realistic path, outside of marriage, and is by no means a guarantee. You need to work for them for at least a year for the foreign entity/branch before you can transfer to the US, but the firm will have their own criteria for transfers and some won't even transfer at all. So you'd have to make a business case for why you'd need to be transferred to the US and it could take a few years of building connections to do so.",2024-05-08T13:56:16+00:00

Question about an EB3 visa.
Backstory: I work for an international hairdressing company as a salon manager. My life goal was to move to America permanently. In 2016 I was transferred with an L1 visa and it was everything I wanted.
Unfortunately the embassy officer who took my L1 renewal interview didn’t care and denied me for no reason, while my colleague, might I add had hers renewed with zero problems. 
I’ve been working in a UK branch since 2020 and due to Covid screwing with the economy, immigration is no longer a priority at my company.

So I’m looking to see if I can find a salon or company that would sponsor me with an EB3. It sounds like a perfectly reasonable option as a speciality trained salon manager with over 20 years experience.

Is anybody able to explain it a bit further? Is it a path to a green card? 
It’s called an EB3 employment based green card visa in some places.
And I understand you have to wait for a green card to become available? Is that right? 
So can you go and work on the visa but then when a green card becomes available you can adjust status?

And if it is an employment based green card, when does it become possible to move on from that job and then can you get a regular green card?

Any help would be appreciated.",2024-05-08T11:23:36+00:00
immigration,comment,l34b36u,DemWitty,,"This isn't a viable option.

The job would also probably be very difficult to pass the recruitment stage where they have to prove there is no USC or LPR who is has the requisite experience and is willing to do the job.

And no, you cannot spend the time living and working in the US. You'd have to remain abroad the entire time until it's approved. And since you could jump jobs almost right after you're get the green card and move to the US, there is even less incentive for a company to spend that much money and wait that long.",2024-05-08T12:10:37+00:00

They prove this to the government through a competitive recruitment process including publishing multiple newspaper ads, and two other forms of advertisements.

More importantly, the process takes 3-4 years.

1. You don't really have options for a work visa. If you get a bachelor's degree in Australia in a field, and then find an employer to sponsor you for a job, you can qualify for the E-3 work visa.

2. You can get a student visa if you can afford to study for a degree in the US. Estimated costs are generally US$30-50k/year including tuition, rent and other living expenses. If you pick a STEM major, you can have a 3 year work permit upon graduation.

3. If you have ~US$100k to invest and a business plan, you may be able to get the E-2 treaty investor visa. Your business cannot be marginal, i.e. it must be able to financially support more than just you, generally shown by hiring at least one other person.",2024-05-08T09:46:21+00:00

immigration,post,1cmym1z,Significant-Bad-6386,"Full Stack Engineer, with a will to stay an expat. Which country? And doing what?","Hello,

I'm a seasoned French Full-Stack Engineer with over 10 years of experience specializing in web technologies, including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, PHP, Symfony, Java EE, and SQL.

At 34 years old, I've spent a significant part of my career as an expatriate, totaling about 4-5 years abroad. My aim is to continue this international journey until I turn 40.

Previously, I worked in the USA for two years on a J1 Visa. More recently, I was employed in Australia by a prominent IT company, though regrettably, I did not pass the 6-month probation period, resulting in the loss of my work visa.

Despite applying extensively to visa-sponsoring companies in Australia, I have not had success. Consequently, I'm now exploring other potential destinations.

I'm considering two paths forward:

1. **Finding a Sponsored Job in Another Country:** While some countries like the USA have stringent visa requirements, I am open to exploring job opportunities in Asia (particularly Singapore, but I am also comfortable considering other countries) or the Middle East. Additionally, I continue to participate in the US Green Card lottery annually with the hope of eventually returning to work in the USA, despite the low odds. Returning to the USA is also a long-term goal of mine.
2. **Becoming a Digital Nomad:** Transitioning to a digital nomad lifestyle is an attractive option, although I'm aware of the challenges in securing consistent income through platforms like Upwork.

I would greatly appreciate any recommendations or advice on pursuing either of these paths.

Thank you for your insights!",2024-05-08T07:20:19+00:00
immigration,post,1cmy8wu,Odd_Intention4114,Boyfriend is indecisive about marriage and sponsorship,"
I have been in a loving relationship for the last 3 years. I am an immigrant in the US. He is American. We both wanted marriage and kids since we met.  Recently I found out that my workplace has mismanaged my visa application and is now telling me that they will no longer sponsor me. 

My boyfriend and I have spoken about getting married earlier. He agreed to help me with my sponsorship if nothing worked out. That way I can be with him as well as live and work in the US. I have a well paying job and I also have a PhD in computer science.

Now that he has found out that he needs to sponsor me, he is terrified and freaks out everytime I mention sponsorship. We may have to break up because he will not leave the country and I don’t think he will do well in a long distance relationship. I am terrified of losing him. I have lost my family and he is the only person that is close to me. 

He does not give me a straight answer and delays the conversation. It is causing a lot of stress and I don’t know how to converse with him. I also don’t know what is going on in his head. He keeps on telling me that we will be together but does not clarify what that means. 

He is such a kind and compassionate person. I am so anxious of losing him and it’s hard for me to go through my life everyday. I don’t have much time left in the US and I don’t know what to do.

I wouldn’t rely on him and would try to mentally prepare for L-1 visa process or something like that, maybe even permanently moving to another country (and who knows, maybe it’s for the best?).

My then bf of 4 years was kind of the same, evading the conversation when I brought it up or thinking there would still be ways I could do to stay without getting married. I shrugged and told him all the truth and just said I didn't see the point of keep dating long distance as I knew we did not do good in such situation (long distanced for a month max before gawd the communication is hard with someone who is bad at phone + timezone) and even if he wanted to long distance, it would take at least 2 years to come back cause I wouldn't settle for just K1 visa as I wouldn't be able to do anything with that one + extra unnecessary steps. He, albeit reluctantly, agreed to start the process and seemed to be unsure the entire time but he still signed the paperworks. I prepared all the forms on my own + evidence and only asked him for his side of information since I was on his insurance after marriage (we had a short cheap easy city hall ""wedding"") and I paid for all paperworks. With time though he got more comfortable with the fact that I was staying and we were really married so it helped a tons during the green card interview. I think partially he was unsure if I was using him for gc or not, and he was getting too comfortable living together without being married cause honestly our relationship didn't change much after it lmfao but I made it clear for him I was ready and good to opt out of living in USA and leaving him if he didn't make a choice. I was thinking of different countries to go to for funsies and maybe jobs after leaving usa lol I guess seeing me able to plan a life without him woke him up a bit. He did express his disappointment I was able to just up and go feeling wise but I told him I didn't have forever to wait for him, especially when my legal status was in danger and we had been together for long enough anyway.

Slight criticism- Since he’s your last family, you’re clinging on to him and you’re not able to see what he is clearly showing. This is probably one of the hardest times for u and as the person who’s supposed to love you they should be stepping up to help but if he’s not able to make that kind of commitment you need to rethink your feelings and future with him. Believe his actions not his words. He is choosing to have you deported (and break up since he isn’t into long distance) than save you that speaks volumes. Read what you wrote again and pretend its a stranger in this scenario. What would you tell them? 

My advice- you are better off without him. Even if he does sponsor you after much pleading, you can’t get away from him if you ever need to if it gets too toxic, because of the sponsorship, think of your safety first (and don’t say he would never hurt me) and you will be tolerating a lot even if things go south really bad.

what i will say here publicly is:  
americans dont understand these visa issues. they have NEVER had a visa. they havent even thought about immigrating ever in their lives. this is quite new for them. so be patient and explain with bullet points every scenario. 

example:  
these are my options:

a) look for another work visa: explain why this is so hard and visa-wise complicated  
b) get xx visa

c) asylum

d) F1 visa

d) marriage: and explain to him here the benefits, the disadvantages, the implications for him and for you if things dont work out (which are not so much, he can divorce and if you still prove it was a bona fide marriage you wont get a problem with ur GC), and how things would be easier for both of you (including you will have a work permit and you can help out with bills etc i dont know).

like take a pen and a paper and write down everything about every option, so he can visualize better. this worked for me to reduce his anxiety, but hes still nervous about marrying lol

  
plus: explain to him why the marriage option is scary for you as well, that you didnt even think about this before because you had your visa and everything was fine, and that you are not with him with intentions of obtaining an immigration benefit. explain to him how ridiculous would be thinking that you want him for that after 3 year relationship, spending a lot of time together, trips sex etc,  and you havent mentioned anything about GC before.",2024-05-08T19:30:56+00:00

Despite cost of living and any other external factors, we would prefer to live in Ontario together.

Additionally I want to help and find a way for my mother (57F) to also come to Canada with us. Whom of which has an associates in accounting, and has over 40 years experience in accounting and bookkeeping, however does not have a CPA.

I have looked into my visa options:

* I don't feel I will be eligible for express entry for quite some time
* I have considered Student visa, I can continue my education past 2 years and that would place me in Ontario with my partner, and this may also leverage our relationship as common law I believe? Where you need to live with them for 12 months to be considered common law/conjugal. The downside to this is the cost of international schooling.
* I don't believe spousal sponsorship would be an option for us, since we're both young and don't have anyway to show on paper that she can support me financially.

1.) Depending on if Trump wins/loses will this hurt/help how long it will take me to get my Green Card? Also, if Biden wins, is it likely I’ll have an easier time when the time comes?

- File i40 (premium processing) 15 days

3. Same answer as #2. Can’t predict the future. Depends on how the labor market for nurses looks in 2-3 years. 

4. After I-140 is approved, you have to wait to file an I-485 based on the then-visa bulletin and your priority date.

immigration,post,1cmtcuh,ablautreduplication,How do wealthy western democracies DIS incentivize ILLEGAL immigration in the long run ?,"We all know wealthy stable liberal pluralistic western democracies are the top destination for global migrants. We also know wealthy countries need *some* immigrants (poor ones and educated ones) to fill certain jobs for their economies and decent morals and we know most people want that done in a controlled , safe , fair process . 

But realistically, the word is out ! This means a shit ton of people globally want to a move to just few places (15-20 countries are top destinations , this also doesn’t include the millions who want to come legally to make bank , engineers and such but leave that aside I’m talking about broke folk)   . With cheap smart phones and social media , plus the gap between rich and poor countries growing , plus cheap budget air flights , plus climate change , it seems like the INCENTIVE + actual ease of illegal migration is EASIER then ever before . Just think : nowadays  a poor dude in Venezuela OR Mauritania OR Haiti has access to a cheap phone with a picture and address of his friend in Madrid or NYC or London , who is holding a wad of cash and a hospital or church or shelter to stay at. That dude is fucking on the move ! 

Honest question : how the holy hell does any rich country disincentivize that GLOBAL demand , from tens of millions of people from all over the world staring at cheap cell phones while their shitty country falls apart  , from such a MASSIVE draw to illegally shoot their shot . 

Due to technology, it seems illegal migration is EASIER than ever (wiring money to smuggler , getting addresses, booking cheap air flight to visa  free transit country *China to Ecuador* for example )  as well as massively INCENTIVIZING this thang with juicy pictures of new sneakers and a wad of euros or dollars from their boy who is already there . 

I’m imagining the flow from Haiti, Africa , poor Asia , Venezuela , will be like P Diddy “can’t stop won’t stop “ year after year after year . How do you disincentive that honey pot enough to stop some of it ?",2024-05-08T02:10:54+00:00

immigration,post,1cmrx23,vincenzopiatti,Is there any benefit of filing DS-260 if I'm planning to do an Adjustment of Status based on DV lottery?,"I'm in the US with a non-immigrant visa (F-1) and I've been selected in the DV lottery (case number EU26XXX). I keep seeing people giving the advice to file DS-260 as quickly as possible because it apparently affects how early one can schedule a visa interview at the consulate. I know that DS-260 is optional for people who want to file I-485, but I still see some people advising filing DS-260 quickly. Considering the following, should I file DS-260 quickly or wait or not file it at all?

* The embassy in my country has been notoriously slow in processing visas and many DV lottery winners could not finish their visa processing in the recent years so I probably will go down the AOS (I-485) path.
* Based on prior years' visa bulletins my case number will probably be current around June/July 2025 which means I won't have a lot of time to get everything done, so I want to take early action where possible.
* My F-1 status (currently working with OPT EAD) is valid until February 2026 and I do plan to travel outside the US and back multiple times between now and July 2025 (or whenever my DV case number is current). So I guess when I file I-485, I can no longer travel in and out of the US with an F-1 visa since I will have indicated immigration intent.
* My employer is looking for ways for keeping me in the US (applied for H-1B, but didn't get selected in the lottery, they'll apply again this upcoming cycle) and there are ongoing talks about EB-2 sponsorship as well (but almost certainly EB-2 process would not be completed by the time my OPT expires). I don't intend to tell my company that I won the DV lottery as I don't want them to let go of GC sponsorship in case the DV path doesn't work out. Also, I'm pretty sure two I-485s based on different merits can be processed simultaneously so doubling down on a GC in two separate paths sounds appealing to me.
* If I'm laid off at some point in the near future and have to leave the US without I-485 process is completed, then I'd have to go through consular processing, probably in a neighboring country of my home country due to the difference in consular services performance of the embassies.

Given my case, should I rush to file DS-260 or wait until around May/June 2025 to file it?",2024-05-08T00:59:14+00:00

I am an American citizen living in the USA and this question pertains to a random woman I met on the street. 

She is a 70 year old homeless woman. She has no family, no friends, no home. She does not have a single piece of legal documentation that she exists. She says everything she had was thrown away. She said she was born in the USSR in Ukraine and became naturalized in the 1980s.

She said the National Archives and Records Administration has a record of her existence. She gave me her information and I thankfully she has a phone which I can keep in touch with her.

I was able to contact this office and they mailed me a legal copy of her ""Petition of Naturalization"" from the 1980s. Everything in it is as she said. But this seems useless for any purpose.

I am trying to contact the local state RMV but navigating their customer support is a nightmare.

I spoke to someone on the phone at the USA Department of Immigration Services and they said to make a Freedom of Information Act request for her documentation. I am doing so, and its clear I can request copies of legal documents from them, but I assume they will reject this request.

The woman on the phone also said if I bring the woman to a local USDIS field office they will reject her.

What to do? Any help would be appreciated..

Thanks.

immigration,post,1cmqt3s,dnyal,[U.S. Visa] I have two names! Did my mom and sis fill out her DS-160 wrong???,"Hey, everyone! So, there’s some family drama here.

**TL;DR:** family filled out their DS-160 using my maiden name. Will that be a problem?

I’m an immigrant and became a U.S. citizen a few years ago. My mother and sister intend to visit me (they don’t want to immigrate), so they filled out their DS-160 for a B visa.

The issue is my mother and sis filled out their DS-160 with my legal name in our country of origin, which is now my maiden name here. They put it in the fields that ask for the person paying for their trip and their point of contact.

The drama is because I changed my surname after marriage here in America years ago, but such custom doesn’t exist in my country of origin. I just never told my family that I ever married because they don’t approve of the person I’m with, and I would prefer for them to not know, either. They just think my husband is my boyfriend, and I don’t want to deal with their frankly toxic drama.

Will it be an issue that they used my (maiden) name in their DS-160?

I’m honestly more worried that the consular agent will ask them who [name] [married surname] is, and my family will be like, “You mean [name] [maiden surname]???” and then it’ll open that can of worms.

Thank you!",2024-05-08T00:03:20+00:00

If you have a fraudulent SSN number once you get a EAD and a SSN you will have to work using YOUR SSN your ITIN will be invalid. You will also have to disclose your unauthorized work and your fraudulent SSN to USCIS on the I-485.
They will already know your working while unauthorized due to filing taxes. You can’t lie about this because you’ll be slapped with a fraud/misrepresentation ban.

I am 30 M single male Indian living in Canada(came here on closed work permit).

I want to apply for B2 visa 
Reason : Want to visit some place in New york. Only tourism.

Below are some of my question, if someone can help out that would be great.:

1) in the travel section, should i select b1/b2(business and tourism) or tourism/medical treatment (b2)?
2) In the same section where you will stay, can i randomly put in any hotel detail or check with any particular hotel and get a confirmation over email or do a random booking for the date I am putting?
3) Should i give the intended date after 6 month, what be a good date to fill in?
4) in address and phone section, should i provide the address printed on the passport(Indian) or the onw where I am currently staying in Canada? 
5) Mailing address should be the Canada one since I am here currently?
6)For social netwok section, I only use Linkedin not on FB and instagram, is that ok or will it raise suspicion?
7) in the US contact section, i do not know anyone, should i use the same address as the hotel or Manager of the hotel? Do i need to get the booking done before even scheduling the interview?

It's highly unlikely that I am going to get appointment as waiting is 700+ days, 

8)any suggestions on how to get an earlier date.

I might return back to india by end of this year, it feels impossible to get a date but I still want to give a try.

9) does these information looks suspicious, anyone who have got the visa from canada like this can help?

any further suggestions will be appreciated

Apologies for the seemingly repetitive post. I know there's a ton of posts on this, but was hoping to get some insight on a more specific question:  
I'm currently on a conditional GC through marraige to my USC spouse. My understanding is that the processing for this is so backlogged right now, it's highly unlikely i'll receive my 10 year GC or interview before it expires in <6 months. From what I've heard from reddit/friends and read on the USCIS website, it seems like I will receive an extension on my conditional GC for 24/48 months. I'm also under the impression that this letter/approval notice will serve as the document that will let me continue to legally work and leave/re-enter the country.  
Can anyone confirm if my understanding is correct?

Im a US Citizen (born in Los Angeles) living in Miami and recently proposed to my girlfriend of 1 year who is Venezuelan. Just wondering what the whole process would be to get her immigration status in order once we get married and to have a basic idea before going to an immigration lawyer. Any tips, suggestions would be appreciated.

She currently has a valid florida drivers license, social security number and a work permit through an asylum petition/tps but she entered the country illegally through the border (Mexico).

Anyhow once we get married, what would be the fastest way to make her a Permanent Resident/US Citizen? I’ve heard she might need to leave the USA first before starting the immigration process after marriage because she entered through the border and not through a valid visa? Is that correct? Because that makes no sense, if she’s already here and has her basic documents (SSN, Driver’s License, Work Permit etc) why would that be required?

Ive also heard other states might be better/faster to help with this topic than Florida ie Utah?

Also what would be the time lines for her to be able to travel and get her green card after the marriage? I believe it’s 1.5-2 years after the marriage? And how long after that would she be able to apply for Citizenship?

if we do proceed with marriage and the waiver for the initial entry would that be faster than the asylum petition?",2024-05-07T22:00:39+00:00
immigration,comment,l31spxv,IamRick_Deckard,,"Yes; the timeline for the initial everything is more straightforward through a normal marriage petition. The timeline for the waiver(s) are not, though. Either way, this is lawyer time for the best path based on the individual situation with her asylum.

Bear in mind that having a pending asylum case and a marriage petition can make things more difficult, as they assume the marriage is fraud (for both or one side) to stay in the country.

It may be that you can marry and file a separate I-130 for the son as a stepson depending on his age and if there is consent from the father. Something to ask a lawyer about.",2024-05-07T22:43:33+00:00

immigration,post,1cmlry9,Andy_Tr434,Updates on marrying a USC as an undocumented immigrant.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/s/Xj6zZKdtuj

Continue with this post from 2 days ago, me and my girlfriend came up with the amount of money we need to be able to file the affdavit of support.

my girlfriend and I don't have enough income, therefore we have to let her mother (who is the 3rd household member) to cosign the affdavit of support with her 30k income. Then we add around 15 or 20k into the amount by using our savings in the past 2 years. Since the minimum amount to sponsor for affdavit of support for 3 household members is 32k. We would need 30k from her mother's income plus my girlfriend's savings account. We have calculated that assets value has to be 3x the amount needed, therefore we will need an additional 9k or 10k at least to make it sufficient. 

Please correct me if i am wrong.",2024-05-07T20:28:04+00:00
immigration,post,1cmlo4j,banana_andwhat,"Divorced then remarried, I'm confused about the questions in N400","Hi all,

Thank you in advance for taking your time reading the post.

I got married 2014, and became a LPR in 2015 (the date on my gc). My process of getting approved for I 751 was a mess because my marriage was going through many problems (including abuse) and my husband decided to disappear on me and everyone else due to debt (probably involved another girl too, but that's just rumor). Anyway, I got a one-sided divorce in 2020 after a long time of trying to reach him with no success. I remarried in 2022. My current husband is US citizen at birth. I finally got my condition removed and got the 10-year gc in 2023. 

Now I'm applying for citizenship. So my question is when the application asks about my ""current spouse"", do I provide info on my current husband, even though I did not get the gc based on him? I can't reach my ex to obtain any document from him. And for the evidence of marriage, from which marriage should I submit? How do I make the officials understand my situation?

I am a Canadian citizen and have been working remotely with a US company for the past 3.5 years. The company has a registered Canadian entity as well which is my employer of record. 

Last year I was promoted to ""Engineering Manager"" from ""Senior Software Engineer"" where my roles changed more on the side of people management as well as technical leadership.

Now I am looking to move to US and while searching through TN visa, I realized I might be eligible for L1A instead which is far more superior. 

I am doing a bit more research to present a case to my company and ask them to sponsor me for L1A. I think both me and my company meet all eligibility criteria. However, the fact that I am working remotely, and will continue to work remotely in US as well, seems problematic to me. 

Having said that, I can't find any information that clearly states that this would be an issue on USCIS website. So looking for some insights from more experienced folks here. Do you think working at a physical office is a requirement for intra-company transfer?

As a guesstimate, another 2-4 years is probable.

Past wait times do not predict future wait times very well for long waits like these. How PD wait works is very similar in some respect to restaurant wait times. Just because someone who joined the line for a popular restaurant at 5pm got in after 30 mins, doesn't mean someone who joined the line at peak hour at 7pm will wait 30 mins. It is difficult to impossible to accurately predict how long the 7pm diner will get in, because it depends on whether other people in line give up (or re-join, which is possible under the PD system).",2024-05-07T20:05:04+00:00

immigration,post,1cmi0b7,spiralunby,Question about accumulating unlawful presence ,"Hello, 
i won’t bore you with the details but basically I am forced to get an uncontested divorce with my husband who is on a H1B visa, and i’m currently on a H4. The court date isn’t out yet but apparently for uncontested divorces you don’t get a notice until less than 48 hours before the date gets decided. Once both parties show up at court on the decided date, the divorce is finalized and I will immediately lose my H4 status, and thus become undocumented. I’ve been looking for jobs that would transfer my H1B visa but the market is very bad right now so it’s been taking forever, so unless i get a job offer before the divorce gets finalized i was recommended that the best option is to leave the country, keep applying to jobs, and then come back once i get an offer from a company that is willing to transfer my old H1B visa. I guess my main concern is that if i won’t know about the court/divorce date until the day before and if i lose my status on that same day how am i going to find the time to get & pack all my stuff, purchase my flight tickets (my parents live far away so last minute flights would also be crazy expensive) so I leave right away? That just seems pretty unreasonable to expect me to do all of that in a day. Is it okay to stay in the states undocumented for maybe 1 or 2 weeks to figure my shit out and pack my bags and leave? Will I still be able to come back without any issues?

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",2024-05-07T17:51:37+00:00

Hi, hoping to find someone with helpful information or similar experiences!
Someone in my family applied for advanced parole months ago and got approved and we have an upcoming trip this Friday back to their hometown (Mexico). They're also in process for their GC about halfway through already. Their lawyers told them they were good to travel so that's why they booked their trip as soon as possible but later on their lawyers mentioned they might run into some trouble entering United States. They have been arrested a few times about 10 years ago for street vending but ALL of the cases are closed and there's papers proving the cases are dismissed. Obviously this scared them very much to the point where they decided not to go anymore. My question is, is there anyone that went through something similar and did you get questioned or were you good to go? Or any opinions and what they should do? Thank you",2024-05-07T16:54:32+00:00

It’s all a tricky one since one of the eligibility questions on the ESTA form is whether or not you have gone to Iran since 2011 and you have not been in two decades.  There are basically two sections in the ESTA that can get you denied because of your connection to Iran.

Can anyone throw a spotlight on steps on name changing after getting married? Planning to take my spouse’s first name as middle name and his last name as my last name.

immigration,post,1cmailf,AmateurCrastinator44,Incorrect information on marriage license application - what does it mean for US family-based immigration?,"I posted this is r/legaladvice, but I think this may be a better place for it.

First of all, I am an idiot. I was so overconfident with my understanding of my parents' information that I didn't verify some important information with them when my wife and I applied for a marriage license or when we requested apostilles on that marriage license. I feel absolutely horrible, and I would appreciate no additional reminders that I am an absolute idiot — I just need to understand how bad of a mistake that is and what can be done to fix it.

As for the specifics of the situation: in dealing with my wife's immigration proceedings I happened to notice on our marriage license that includes the application form that I wrote my father's surname as it was before his marriage to my mother, but I didn't realize my father didn't change his name back to his pre-marriage name following their divorce and I didn't realize my mother was born in a different state from where she spent her adolescence and much of her adult life, so that information is incorrect. All other information is correct.

My question is, since this document is the grounds for which my wife is eligible to immigrate to the US, exactly how much of a blunder have I caused and can it be fixed? That wouldn't make our marriage invalid, right?

We were married online, but technically in Utah county, Utah. I, as the petitioner, have uploaded financial documents and she is preparing to upload her civil documents with the NVC in preparation for her interview.

immigration,comment,l2z2yeo,AffableAndy,,"In general, biology (especially the more academic fields in biology) is oversaturated with PhDs, so it certainly isn't an easy path.

You have to be pretty outstanding in your field and able to get grant funding and have high profile publications. As a warning,  only very high caliber academics really get to choose where they live,  so you may end up getting a job (if you get a job at all) in a part of the US that has awful weather and is very far away from any national parks or significant outdoor recreation. 

As a caveat, in ecology in particular, a lot of non-academic opportunities are with state and federal governments so it can be challenging to get experience or positions.

You could apply to graduate school in the US rather than the UK, or apply for a US postdoc after your PhD. Sometimes postdocs can get an H1B, though most universities will only sponsor H1B if you get tenure.",2024-05-07T13:00:53+00:00

If they place you in deportation proceedings, you may be placed in immigration detention (jail) while you wait for a hearing in front of a judge, or you may be released on a bond/ankle bracelet/other monitoring.

The wait for a hearing may be substantial, measured in months. If the judge finds that you have abandoned your green card, which is almost certainly the case, you would be ordered deported back to your country of origin. If that happens, you would lose ESTA eligibility forever, face a 5 year ban, and would need to apply for a tourist visa to visit the US thereafter (which will unlikely be granted).",2024-05-07T11:50:35+00:00

I am planning to move from Spain where I do my master's degree in a business school to either France or Germany within a year and I can't choose which country to prioritise. Here's a background:

• I am planning to apply to the international companies and I lowkey like my possible options in France more
• I know both languages at B1+ level with German being slightly better

I filed my i130 and i485 together 1-2 months before my 21st birthday in 2022 and at the time F2A was current. When my i130 got approved in October of 2023, it said that i got bumped down to F2B (i was already 21). However, since i was 20 and had a current PD at the time of application, they allowed me to process the i485 which i have pending. But now that im in F2B with a PD of Oct 2022, that means that iam basically stuck in the US unallowed to leave until my i485 is approved but the final action date for F2B is still in 2011… having to wait 10+ years in the US without a GC just seems so hopeless to me.. I would like to live my life normally with no restrictions. Its weird because USCIS already sent an RFE for my medical last year but my f2b PD will be current in like 10+ years. Any chance i actually get my GC soon? Correct me if im wrong but why would they hand my case to an immigration officer for active review and send RFE for medical if im now f2b and far from PD being current? 

i know it doesnt matter what my uscis progress bar says but its been saying 3 weeks left for a while now. I know the progress bar is not accurate but 3 weeks and 10+ years is a big difference..",2024-05-07T04:46:24+00:00

This is from March 2023. There are probably newer reports but the gist is clear. India has about a half million pending petitions, and US immigration law specifies that no one country can receive more than about 25,000 each year. So you have a minimum 20 year wait. But one of the footnotes specifies that only principal beneficiaries are included in the USCIS data. Spouses and children are eligible to receive green cards when someone's application becomes current, and they count against the numerical cap for that country for the year. So in practice if you assume even one average dependent per principal beneficiary (which seems somewhat reasonable to me) you're already up to 40 years.

immigration,comment,l2xi8n2,Automatic-Sport-6253,,"* You can apply for the adjustment of status (getting green card without leaving the country).
* The process is well documented on a bunch of websites such as Boundless (or others, you can google them). You essentially need to fill in 4-7 forms (130, 130A, 485, 864 are absolutely necessary, 693 is necessary but filled by a medical professional, 765 is optional for work authorization if she wants/needs to work until the GC is approved, 131 is optional for traveling without disturbing the adjustment of status process if she plans to travel before the GC is approved). You also need to attach a bunch of evidence and supporting documents.
* If your case doesn't have a lot of tricks (visa overstays, problems with the law, unlawful presence in the past) and you are capable of reading, comprehending, and filling in rather straightforward forms then you can do it yourself without a lawyer.
* The minimal cost will be the fees for all the forms you are filing plus the cost of the medical exam (varies across the country). Plus some amount for FedEx/UPS which is negligible compared to the rest. Fees changed recently, you can find them on USCIS website, but overall be ready to spend at least $2000-$2500.
* One of the things you'll need to submit is the evidence of the bona-fide marriage. If you met before she came to the US as a student then you probably can get some of it. If you met in the US then you will have hard time gathering evidence of serious relationship over just 8 months. But if you genuinely married then you should have at least something. This is one of the most important pieces of the application, you can find tons of posts on this topic on this subreddit with suggestions what can serve as evidence.",2024-05-07T03:21:33+00:00

immigration,post,1clxjgf,serg407,"Went into the immigrant interview and I got a 221G slip
","Hi everyone, so after 8-9 years waiting I finally got my interview letter for an US immigrant visa at the Peruvian embassy. While I was waiting in line outside the security guy told me that I couldn’t go inside the embassy with my folder. Apparently my folder wasn’t approved by the embassy and I had to throw it away, which meant that all my documents had be taken out and carry it on my hands.

When my turn was to get interview the lady told me that I was missing a document. I couldn’t believe it. I checked and rechecked. It was a judicial arrest document. In Peru they ask for 3 types of police document, the police background check, jail background check and judicial background check. So I was missing the latter. Probably I either dropped it or After going into a second window for a second screening the guy at the end of the interview told me, just upload the document on CEAC again and email us and you’ll get your visa back and kept the passport. At first I was optimistic since its a document that I had on my phone I quickly upload it, and let them know within 30 minutes of getting out of the interview. So I thought most likely by the end of the week I should get information.

It’s been 2 weeks now and I’m getting really worried by reading all the sorties that they wait years and years I mean it’s a simple document like they had everything but a single document. Does anyone know if they’re is anything that can be done

immigration,comment,l2x7xkx,Merisielu,,"Hi! I’m also from the UK. My partner is American and I moved here 4 weeks ago.

Your two options are the CR1 and K1.

K1 = fiancé visa. You apply for it, and when approved you go to the US and get married within 90 days. You cannot work (even remotely) or leave the US until your adjustment of status (filed after marriage) goes through. The K1 is taking 11-12 months. The adjustment of status is another 6-9+ months. If you can manage on one wage for an extended period, this is the fastest way. The K1 costs more than the CR1 because of having to pay for the adjustment process, but it still equates to less than one lot of flights between the UK and US.

However, if you want to be able to work and travel (outside the US) as soon as you arrive, the CR1 is your best option. The CR1 or spousal visa means you get married first (wherever in the world you want) and then file. It is taking 18+ months currently, so a while longer. When you arrive in the US you have a greencard immediately with no adjustment required.

Both visas require your partner to sponsor you financially; so they must be earning $25k. The K1 also requires you to have met in person at least once before filing. 


For both visas you file while you’re outside the US; you would need to attend a medical and interview in London for them. You can still visit during the processing, but only for short trips using the ESTA scheme. We had 3 trips during the 11 months our processing took.

People dislike the K1 because of the adjustment period which limits you (not being able to work or travel), whereas the CR1 is less limiting. You can still get a social security number on arrival with a K1, which allows you to get a bank account, driving license, etc., so there are some upsides if you’re stuck unable to work or travel. 

Good luck!",2024-05-07T02:10:03+00:00

immigration,comment,l2xczgs,Merisielu,,"If he doesn’t apply for one, he will be given one at the completion of the adjustment of status.

I arrived 4 weeks ago and in the first 3 weeks sorted all of that! All you need to get the SSN is proof of address, ID, and a valid i94 showing entry on a K1.

You begin with an online application. It’s advised to wait 10 days from entering for the i94 to update. Mine updated within 24 hours. The online application is literally about 5 clicks. Then you make an appointment to take the documentation to your local SSA office. 

I went to mine 8 days after arriving, and did the online application 4 days after arriving. They just take photocopies of the ID and send off the documents. It was approved whilst I was there, and my SSN card was sent a couple of days later. It’s marked as only being suitable for work if you have Homeland permission, which obviously a K1 does not.

From that, the next week we went and got my drivers license (our state required me to take both tests again), and opened a joint bank account. 

You can get the SSN any time up to the marriage and filing the adjustment. After that you have to wait for them to send it after the AoS finishes. 

All in all, the SSN and driving license were the most straightforward and simple things to sort. A driving license is given an expiration date in line with your i94 (which is for the 90 days initially). After you file the AoS, this is updated and you can renew for a longer period. Or you can wait a while to do it. I had been driving here for years and wanted to get it done ASAP. For insurance, you can use a UK license for 3 months on arrival with no issue and get covered by insurance. 

I wouldn’t have known about the SSN either if it wasn’t for people on here explaining; especially those who didn’t know and were stuck without one on the K1.

immigration,comment,l2wfwul,Ok-Importance9988,,"In that case you would need to leave. It is illegal to enter the US on ESTA or another non immigrant status with the intention to adjust status. 

Either you marry and you return to the UK and apply for CR1 visa. This visa becomes a Green Card when used to enter the US (the actual card comes in the mail). Or you apply for K1 (fiancee visa) go to the US then marry then apply for a Green Card. 

A lot of folks prefer the CR1 because it allows you to work travel etc when you arrive no second step. The disadvantage is you a can a K1 visa interview at your embassy more quickly but I have heard that is barely the case anymore.

immigration,post,1cls09j,Aggravating_Show_585,First time travelling to US and Canada,"Hi, I'm from the Philippines and my family of 4 have B1/B2 visas that are expiring next year. We have friends we want to visit in Canada, so we decided to combine it w/ our US trip and already have approved eTA visas.

**Background:**

* Parents are OFWs; me and my sibling are working in PH
* Purpose of visit (US visa interview) - see the Empire State Building (July 2015, did not push through)
* Have travelled previously abroad with the family as dependents (students)

**Planned Itinerary:** MNL -> SF -> Canada -> NYC -> MNL

Aiming to buy US tix as a multi-city on one booking (MNL -> SFO; JFK -> MNL) then separate one-way tix for Canada. Planning to allot more days in Canada (b/w 1-2 weeks) but won't be staying at our friend's place.

**Questions:**

1. Will the order of our travel (SF before NYC) affect our chances to pass through immigration if we're asked purpose of visit and we provide our initial answer?
2. Will our long stay in Canada possibly warrant additional questions/show of documents?
   1. Would it be better to have an invitation letter from our friend?
3. If our parents are shouldering most of the expenses for the trip, do we still need to show that we have enough funds individually instead of as a family?

This is a huge trip for us especially cost-wise compared to past trips, so I want to ensure that we all have the best chance to pass through immigration. Your answers would be greatly appreciated!",2024-05-06T19:39:04+00:00

immigration,post,1clo5km,cornfl4kegirl,moving from uk to france?,"hi! i'm not great at reddit so sorry if this isn't allowed!

i'm a UK citizen looking to move to France (I speak french and hold a degree) - just wondering if there is anyone here who has done that and can give me some advice? i'm just not sure about how things will work because a) I have a UK passport and b) I would be moving totally on my own, I don't have a french partner or french family. 

I've been looking for jobs that would sponsor a visa but haven't had any luck yet. would it be possible to move over to France and get a job once i'm there (bartending/hospitality etc)? i know not having a job would make it difficult to find accommodation. 

i have lived in France before but it was part of my degree course so everything was a lot easier! thanks in advance for any help :) ",2024-05-06T17:01:59+00:00
immigration,comment,l2uu0gy,not_an_immi_lawyer,,"Look at these pages provided by the French government:

- https://france-visas.gouv.fr/en/professional-purpose

- https://france-visas.gouv.fr/en/salaried-employment

Unfortunately, the UK does not have youth mobility/working holiday visa arrangements with France.

To answer your questions:

1. You generally must find a skilled job that utilizes your degree/experience. In general, you simply cannot work in France for a low skilled job (bartending/hospitality/etc), unless it's a seasonal job permit (in which case France requires that you spend no more than 6 months in every 12 months in France).

2. You generally cannot move over and get a job once you're there. You need a long stay visa and cannot convert from a tourist visa to a long stay visa. Of course, you can enter as a tourist to job hunt for up to 90 days in every 180 days, then fly back to the UK once your time is up/you found a job and need to apply for the long stay visa.",2024-05-06T17:18:03+00:00

","
Hi! I have my B1/B2 appointment this Thursday on 9 May. I had booked this appointment in January, 2024 which was within the 6 months from my last rejection of the B1/B2 visa in August 2023. So, in my appointment details, I did mention that I have had a rejection in the last 6 months. But I'm only realising now that I'm past 6 months as of May but my appointment details say ""yes"" for this question.

Now, if I want to change this detail, I will have to cancel my appointment which would make it impossible for me to get a visa in time for my trip. Would this be an issue for my application?

To try and make a long story short, I'm on a temporary work visa in Canada barely keeping my head above water in a job that's incredibly volatile and could end up unemployed with little to no notice. I'm applying for more jobs in the meantime here but ultimately I want to live with my partner and the work situation has me trying to expidite the process in any way possible (if I'm going to end up jobless and homeless here I'd ratger find a job down there) We've looked at a few options and I'm likely going to apply for my ESTA so if push comes to shove and I'm without work and therefore shelter, they can come up here in a U-haul and I can stay with them for 3 months.

 As an Australian citizen, I was thinking of applying for the E-3 Visa, using 8 years of work experience in site surveying since I don't have a college degree in anything but figured surveyors are a specialised profession. I have heard though that the E-3 is not dual intent, when I do have full intentions to stay.
We have considered applying for a K-1 visa, though are unsure if it will take longer or is more likely to be rejected than an E-3. Also with our relationship being mostly long distance and only being together since late 2022, and also it being same sex I don't know if they're more likely to decline over a more ""traditional"" one. 
Also hesitant to even get the ESTA because I've heard that it impedes marriage or a worker visa if you're in the country on it. Apologies if this is poorly worded, any advice at all is appreciated.",2024-05-06T16:50:10+00:00

You can change to some other statuses (e.g. F student, J exchange), but cannot change to H/L work visa or any green card/permanent residency statuses until you finish the 2 years back in your country of residence.",2024-05-06T16:47:06+00:00

immigration,comment,l2x6122,admred,,"Hi. I think the confusion lies on SAVINGS vs. INCOME. 

I don’t remember reading about $30K to 50K “SAVINGS”.  

I have helped family and relatives with affidavits of support. Never have I ever shown bank accounts or my savings to them. I have, however, declared my annual income to them. (Tax Returns)

I supposed you mean $30-$50k annual “INCOME” (different from savings). 

So if you and your partner can show you both earn about $2,500/ a month, then your annual income will be about $30,000. 

I’m sharing with you based on my personal knowledge and experience. 

Remember, you are “documented” (just out of status). And you can get back your status when you marry a citizen. All the best to you.

immigration,comment,l2tzxhb,iskender299,,"in Europe is pretty easy, as long as you get a job offer that do sponsor visas. -- I would say that most international companies with local offices do sponsor, or at least the ones I worked for. Language shouldn't be an issue but you'll have to learn to integrate. Can also be fun, as long as it's not Polish or Dutch.

Some countries (Poland for example) have some loopholes that makes it even easier (taking Polish classes counts as studies which in the end can help getting a work permit). There are also some incubators that do some visa shenanigans due to some loopholes.

In terms of expectations, expect your gross income to go down 40-50% especially if you're used to northeast/ cali wages. Taxes are higher and you'll pay healthcare and social care so the net wage will be... shocking at the beginning.

All other taxes are crazy high (imagine sales tax at 25%, that's how much is the DK VAT rate...). This means that the prices of almost everything are higher. We also hate cars so we tax them like crazy. But we do have better public transportation, at least in metropolitan areas so there's less need of a car. Long distance is still dominated by cars or planes. There's a tax nearly on everything. Want coke? it's taxed extra. Want electronics? are usually taxed extra. Wanna fly somewhere? Greta is going to tax you...and so on... if there's one thing I got pissed off in the EU it's taxes.

Social care is top-notch, and work regulations as well. This means an employer can't just fire you and when they finally do, you're protected for a few months until you find a new job. You're also protected in case of some unexpected leaves (health, childcare, bereavement, etc).

Education is generally very good and free or accessible. However, lacks research power compared with US.

Banking is good, according to 21st century. You'll forget what checks are in no time. Everything is at a tap on your phone.

And don't expect the public healthcare to be top notch:

* you pay for it from salary, in % (so if you get a bit higher wage in EU, you might pay more than the best private in the US). It's affordable as long as you're insured, but the great majority of people are.
* Accessing it can be challenging if you're looking for anything more than GP or getting non-emergency procedures. (that's because there's a backlog and monthly funds, funds which end days after unlocking due to backlog).
* Don't expect new treatments and methods for complicated diseases, including some cancers. Even when new treatments arrive, many times they're not yet included in the insurance. It's a bit hilarious because people are laughing at the american system then they're fundraising for treatments there because they're not done in the EU or the lists are too long... leukemia is unfortunately a popular case. Another one was Sovaldi which when was approved in EU, was initially not included in the insurance and it was 120k EUR.
* It's a much safer system generally as long as nothing serious hits you (except emergencies).",2024-05-06T14:17:51+00:00

My wife’s brother’s family came through the diversity visa in her second year in the US, and while there was no way that we could refuse a 15-25 year shortucut to having them in the country it was in some ways more than either of us bargained for. In our case, our family members were basically dependent on us to do everything for them to help them settle and start their new lives, and it put a real emotional and financial burden on us for several years and caused serious strain in our marriage.  

My unsolicited advice is to start planning for their careers and housing in the US ASAP, especially if they’re coming from a part of the world that they’re going to want to leave as soon as possible. Have a realistic conversation with your wife about where they are going to live and what boundaries you will have. While the diversity visa is certainly a unique opportunity for thousands of families each year and your personal circumstances may be very different from ours, I can’t help but wonder at times if several years of our lives would have been happier if they had come through some other visa category that either gave everyone more time to plan or forced them to have some sort of opportunity for employment or education lined up.",2024-05-08T03:58:11+00:00

Myself (Australian) & my partner (German) have been in a relationship for almost a year & and travelled extensively around the world + lived together here in Australia during that time (Partner on working visa). 

We've decided to take our relationship the next step & looking at a Partner Visa. We're aware of the Australian process & will need to get our relationship registered as a civil/defacto relationship. 

My partner's visa ends in August this year. We've planned to apply for the Partner Visa before this obviously, however we have planned to go back to Germany to visit my partners family in December.

I have a few questions I'd really appreciate some advice/answers for:  


1. If we apply for the partner visa, can my partner & I still travel back to Germany while waiting for the result (A few months after).   

2. The partner visa for Germany is significantly more cheaper & easier to get (75EUR) Compared to the Australian partner visa ($8,550AUD). Could I also apply for a partner visa for Germany so that we have permeant residency in both countries?

immigration,comment,l2taiyh,iskender299,,"You apply in October - November. 

Results come out in May the next year. 

If selected, you fill DS-260 as soon as you can. 

Then you wait. Depending on your region and case number, you’ll be invited for the interview. Lower case number means you’ll be invited quickly, higher means you’ll be invited later or not at all. Yes, you can be selected and not invited for the interview. This is because the number of visas is fixed and one applicant might have multiple dependents with them, each taking one visa. So when the visas finish for the year, that’s it 🤷🏽‍♂️ for example if you’re in Europe and you have a CN 40k+, low chances to make it. 

If a visa is granted, you have max 6 months to enter the US, but before your medical exam expires.

Ps. It can take a minimum of a year (from the application moment) to around 2 years if your visa is granted at the end of FY. For example, for DV2025 you apply in OCT 2023, results in may 2024 and visas start to be processed from FY25 which starts in October. If you have low CN, you might get an interview in October 2024, if you have a high CN, you might get an interview in September 2025.",2024-05-06T11:02:46+00:00

I wouldn’t risk visiting every 2 weeks because it looks like you’re just trying to game the system to keep your GC. Set a realistic timeline of being out the country to handle your affairs i  Canada.

immigration,post,1cledc0,lemonflava,How can I live with my wife somewhere in EU?,"Hey, so I've been married for 2 years and together for 6 years. I was born and lived in Portugal but I am not Portuguese, I am German/American (have dual citizenship). My wife is Turkish. For the first 3 years of our relationship she always relied on work visas to live in Europe. Then we decided to try to get a spouse visa. We tried this first in Portugal where I was living at the time, but it seemed impossible as during covid the SEF stopped making appointments and basically collapsed completely. So we gave up and moved to Germany (since I'm a German citizen), hired a lawyer and started the spouse visa process there. But, it's been almost 2 years and we are still not even close to getting the visa. The process is too complex, we have submitted an application but the consulate in Istanbul requested that the marriage be registered in Turkey which means that she will have to change her name (this is Turkish law) which invalidates all of the previous documents we already gave them. Basically by following their request we will probably have to start from scratch.

 It seems average waiting time for turkish citizens in this process is 11 months just for the appointment. This is insane, as I know other countries have much shorter waiting times. So I'm assuming there are easier countries to get a spouse visa in for turkish citizens. 

I just want to know, where is the easiest place for a German/American/ de facto Portuguese to live with my Turkish spouse in Europe? Is there any easier place? I'm also considering going back to Portugal for this but I don't know if the situation is any better.

Relative also had a Philippines passport but not sure if it’s expired or not and not sure if it’s necessary to have it to be able to travel.

We are wondering if relative needs to apply for tourist visa to visit Mexico, what documents are needed or what else they would need to do to be able to travel with to Mexico. 

We want to visit for a few days, probably less than a week, and want to stay pretty close to the border. ",2024-05-06T07:02:45+00:00

immigration,post,1clcpi2,feet1994,DV Won - I apparently have two nationalities (which i missed on my ESTA),"Hello,

I m in a strange situation. I won the DV Lottery and started to ask my parents for the proper documents, for example birth certificate. Previously when I applied for ESTA to visit (2017, 2019, 2024) i always said NO to ""Are you now, a citizen or national of any other country?"" and ""Have you ever been a citizen or national of any other country?"".

For some background. My family fled the Balkan war 24 years ago to Denmark. 

Now, my mom chocks me and tells me that I am a national of the country I was born in (I got mad). She has papers of it. I had NO fucking clue and she said no when I asked and applied for ESTA. Pleasea note I have been to the country 2 times when I was a child and I hold NO passport.

This means basically that what is applied for in my previous ESTAs is wrong.

What do I do now? Is the DS260 form connected to the ESTA and they automatically will ban me from ever visiting the US? Will they still take an interview with me and I can explain the situation? Should I call the embassy in Denmark and explain the situation? And how vital is it that I am fast with my DS260 form?

So many questions, so little answers.",2024-05-06T06:55:52+00:00

Tough situation.

They'll still take an interview with you. The problem with immi is that after 18 you're on your own, including researching whether you're holding another country's citizenship.

There are some corner cases of which people are unaware, for example, children of iranian men are automatically citizens as well as their wives. Say A came to Europe in 50s, had male B son in Europe, never went back to Iran, male B marries an european woman, she's automatically iranian citizen and unless they research, she can be completely unaware.

Right now, the only thing you can do is to move forward and have a good explanation during the interview.",2024-05-06T08:56:36+00:00

immigration,post,1clbyxq,Massiveredboiii,Fiancé visa or the path I should take to get to the U.S. with my Russian Partner.,"Hey there! To give a brief overview of what I'm wondering about, I'm wondering what the best method of coming to the U.S. with my partner (at the same time) would be, or if some other path would be preferable. 

Now, to give more background info. I'm an American Citizen who has spent almost all my life overseas in China, and while I do have an income and live pretty comfortably here, it is below the FPL of $20,440 (since I get paid in RMB). My partner and I have known each other for a very long time (since middle school) and we've been officially dating for almost 4 years and we got engaged last year. The main reason we've been holding off on tying the knot is that I've read that the requirements, especially in terms of financial requirements, are more lenient for fiance visas, and fiance visas are processed a lot faster than fiance visas.

The current plan is that I'd head to Michigan this August and stay for around 3 weeks, ideally getting a U.S. bank card, looking into the technical college I was planning on attending, investigating jobs at the airport, getting a driver's license, and ofc right now I'd research what it'd take to become a state resident (of Michigan in this case) and see if I could fulfill those requirements as well. The main reason I'd wanna head to Michigan is cause I have cousins and family who work there, and it looks like my brothers and sisters might be heading there too (in the future)

Anyhow, then, I'd head back to China, stay here for another 10-11 months or so, and then head with my partner to the U.S. in July or so, where we'd then rent our cousin's second, smaller house. I'd start working right away, and then we'd get married within the 3 months of my partner's K1 visa, and then, move on to getting a green card. To be honest, I'm not 100% sure of the process, or what the best path for us to take would be, but I am here cause I wanna learn, and to be able to get a better image of our future.

 Any extra tips or info would be greatly appreciated, as I'm not super sure where to start, and I just wanna give a quick thanks to anyone taking the time to reply!",2024-05-06T06:04:34+00:00

That includes remote work outside the US. If you are financially restricted, it may be a bigger priority to you that she can work sooner.

immigration,post,1clan54,thaichillipepper,Urgent: Should I switch to EAD from H1-B before job loss?,"I have an H1-B visa expiring in late 2025. I also have an EAD card from my EB-1 visa expiring in early 2025. My I-485 priority date is in November 2022 so probably at least a year till I get my green card. Ok, that's enough context.

I might lose my job in 10 days. I asked my company lawyers and they said I am pursuant to H1-B and so I will only have 60 days if I am still on H1-B when I lose my job. They said, I could switch  to EAD when I am still working and then I could stay in USA as long my AOS (Adjustment of status) is under processing. The only reason they still recommend many people like me to stay on H1-B is because if AOS gets rejected, I will have to leave the country as I cannot go back on H1-B.

Given this, it looks like a straightforward decision for me to move to EAD. Am I missing something? Also, if I lose my job and if I am on H1-B, is there really no way to move to EAD at that time (so that I get more time than 60 days to find a job)?",2024-05-06T04:39:46+00:00

If no AP, leaving and reentering the US has no effect as you'd use your H-1B to be admitted.

If you have an AP, leaving and reentering the US is not needed as your status is authorized pending AOS adjudication.

In both cases, you can use your EAD without reentering the country.

EDIT:

But note that since you used your AP to enter last time, you are already not on H-1B status anymore. You are a parolee.

But all that is irrelevant. You are free to stay in the US until your AOS is adjudicated. It was the case whether or not you entered with AP.

I-9 reverification does not change your status.

It doesn't matter much, but unless you filed for an H-1B extension/amendment after your last entry, then you are not on H-1B, you are a parolee and not on H-1B status. Check your I-94

> If I go through I-9 reverification and change to be pursuant to EAD (before I am let go), then I could stay in US as long my AOS is pending.

Did they actually say that, or are you inferring? I am fairly certain this is wrong, especially given the fact that employers doing paper I-9 will not even notify DHS that you used your EAD.

Your ability to stay while your AOS is pending  is valid, but it does not dépend on doing an I-9 reverification.

> I just realized that switching on EAD means I won't be able to go outside the US until I get new AP

If you're gonna lose your job at your current employer in 10 days, that really doesn't change much as you won't be able to travel with your H-1B after that either. If you use your EAD before you lose your job then it is not recommended to travel on the same H-1B after that (though there's no hard rule - it just seems weird to do so).

But you'd have to be back to the US before these 10 days anyway, as otherwise you'd have to way to get back in the US at all (no AP, no H-1B because job is terminated)

immigration,post,1clafjb,twe0brr,Green Card via EB1B or marriage?,"Hello all. I apologize in advance if this is a noob question. I am still in the process of researching my options and couldn't find any similar questions asked in in the past.

I am an EU citizen applying to obtain a green card. I completed my PhD in the US and am currently employed in biotech on a H1B visa. I have been with the same company for about 3 years. There are two options available to me:

1. **EB1B through my employer:** My employer is willing to fully sponsor my EB1B petition. Many of my coworkers (from China, Japan, EU) have successfully gone through the same process, and my employer has a law firm on retainer that will assist with the application. There is some clerical work on my end, mostly requesting and drafting reference letters. But I would not have to pay out of pocket or do anything else. The one catch is that I am planning to leave my company sometime in late 2025 to be together with my fiance (see below).

2. **Marriage:** I am planning to marry my fiance (US citizen) this August. We currently live long-distance due to school/work, and unfortunately we don't expect to live together until late 2025. We have been together for almost 5 years with plenty of photographic documentation.

**Which option would be the easiest and/or fastest way to obtain my green card?** I am leaning toward the first option since I wouldn't have to pay anything, and I suspect it would be faster since I could start the application now.

","I'm posting here seeking recommendations for experienced immigration attorneys or law firms who specialize in medical visa extensions and have a high success rate with USCIS approvals.

Here's the situation: A close friend is currently in the US on a B1/B2 visitor visa for the past 4 months. Tragically, during her stay she has been diagnosed with cancer and other serious medical conditions requiring ongoing treatment here.

To continue her care, we need to apply for either a medical emergency visa or medical visa that would allow her to extend her authorized stay for at least 6 more months (possibly longer if treatment is still ongoing).

I believe one option is filing Form I-539 with USCIS for an extension, but I'm not fully clear on the process, timelines, and ensuring we put forth the strongest possible application to maximize chances of approval.

We already have documentation ready - letters from all treating physicians detailing her medical conditions, treatment plans, and evidence of funds to cover medical costs. However, I want to ensure we have experienced legal guidance as well.

If anyone could please recommend immigration law firms or attorneys in the US with deep expertise in employment-based visa extensions for medical reasons, I would really appreciate it. Looking for professionals who:

* Regularly handle the I-539 and medical visa extension process
* Have an exceptional track record of successful USCIS approvals
* Thoroughly understand USCIS requirements/criteria for these cases
* Can advise on ensuring no issues with future US entry after departure

Time is of the essence due to the serious nature of her health situation. I want to ensure we put our best foot forward with the visa application.

Any referrals to competent, knowledgeable immigration counsel would be enormously helpful. I'm hoping to find an attorney who can guide us through this smoothly.

Let me start with some background. My brother and I both live in the US - I am a US citizen while is a citizen of an Asian country. He has been working on an H-1B work visa / status while waiting on the PERM process for an employment-based green card. He has a flawless criminal history and immigration record (no unlawful presence etc ever). He is the only family I have and I have often relied on him (financially, emotionally etc) - especially because of my long-term health problems and documented disability which sometimes make it difficult for me to function on a daily basis.

A few weeks ago, he was suddenly laid off in a shocking move by his employer. He's frantically trying to find another job that will let him work on an H-1B and start another PERM for him. The job market in his field is really bad right now and it's likely he will not be able to find a job in time before he ultimately has to leave the US at the end of his 60-day grace period.

I am happy to ""sponsor"" him on a family-based immigrant petition (Form I-130) but the State Department bulletin shows the wait times for that category (F4) are 15+ years!! And I understand he can't stay in the US while that is pending (unless he secures another status independently).

I'm freaking out and don't know if we even have any options here to keep him in the US. I am unable to go with him and live in another part of the world due to my health. If he has to leave, it will be very distressing for me and I don't know how I will even be able to survive on my own.

Please share your thoughts if you have any ideas on possible options we could try in this situation. For instance, if there's any way he can somehow stay and work lawfully in the US while waiting for however long it takes to get the family-based green card...

We exercise our discretion on a case-by-case basis, by evaluating positive factors in the record against any negative factors. Having an urgent humanitarian reason or a significant public benefit is a positive determining factor, and it is evaluated against any negative factors present in a case. We evaluate the complete record.

Some common discretionary factors that we evaluate include (but are not limited to):

Whether the purpose of the parole request may be accomplished within a specific, temporary period of time;

Whether the beneficiary intends to leave the United States when their parole expires or has means to obtain lawful immigration status during the parole authorization period or any re-parole period that is envisioned (where applicable);

Whether there is evidence of any national security concerns;

Whether there is evidence of any criminal history or previous immigration violations;

Whether there is evidence of any previous participation in fraud;

Whether the beneficiary’s presence would benefit a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident or community in the United States;",2024-05-06T19:10:37+00:00

I set an appointment for the local consulate this coming Friday. I have an application and am getting the documents from my dad tomorrow….So I have two questions

1) Is the process for citizenship as simple as everyone is making it out to be due to the changes and the removal of the apostille process? And if anyone has gotten appointment with a consulate what is the new process? 

2) I recently got engaged and although my fiance is of Mexican origin, she is 4th generation American. Would she be able to obtain citizenship through our marriage in the future?

2. Your new employer must file a fresh H-2B application for you, even if you're already working for another H-2B employer.

I'm currently a student at Princess Noura University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and I've been selected for the DV-2025 program.

I've completed high school and have the diploma, but I'm in my second year of university pursuing a bachelor's degree. Since I plan to pause my studies to move to the U.S. and get a green card, I'm not sure how to answer the education section on the form.

The options include ""high school diploma,"" ""some university courses,"" and ""university degree."" I'm concerned that if I choose only the high school diploma, they might see my university on social media and think I'm hiding something. However, I haven't finished my bachelor's degree, so I definitely shouldn't select ""university degree."" If I choose ""some university courses,"" I don't know if they'll ask for transcripts or other documentation to prove my status.

Before the question, how would you move to the US? Do you have funds to move there? apartments? immediate job offers? realistically, nobody in the US would hire you as someone not even with a college degree.

immigration,comment,l2s48kk,rickrollmops,,"> does it make sense to get my I140 approval decision earlier (45 days against 10 months) through premium processing?

I'm not sure if there are predictions for India EB-1 but there's a chance the visa bulletin will become current at the start of the new fiscal year on October 1st. So having the I-140 approved early might allow you to file I-485 earlier. I have absolutely no idea about how EB-1 India will be like on October 1st though, but I'm sure some people do.

An additional advantage is peace of mind - knowing your I-140 is approved is one big thing to get out of the way.

Another advantage, as you said, is to be able to change employers (see below)

> Will it impact the priority date?

Not sure what you mean, but your priority date never changes. Nothing can impact it.

> my H1B also got picked in this year’s lottery. If I get my I140 soon can I then activate my H1B (currently being filed in consuldar processing) to change employers later in the year? 

Your I-140 must have been approved for 180 days before you can change employers without having to file another I-140. See https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-e-chapter-5 which lists all the rules.

Note that when you file I-485 you must not be abroad or travel around that time. You can travel before you file, but when you file, wait to receive the receipt notice before you travel internationally.",2024-05-06T03:13:01+00:00

immigration,post,1ckxkj8,PhileasF23,Need help regarding 212(a)(6)(C)(ii),"Hello, my grandma got denied for her immigration visa under 212(a)(6)(C)(ii). However, she has not made any material misrepresentation. We had applied for her immigration visa, and she sought the help of a local agency, Who gave her a new passport every time we applied, given she has dyslexia, she cannot read or understand any terms herself. Those people gave her a new passport with a new date of birth so that was the only misrepresentation. And now since we realized and corrected it, she has been denied under 212(a)(6)(C)(ii). She is all alone in my home country with no one to look after her. And we can’t make trips back and forth given we have jobs here. As her health is declining we are really concerned. Is there any way to mitigate this? Or has anyone ever came across this? Any advice or help would be useful. ",2024-05-05T18:16:29+00:00
immigration,comment,l2pz2sg,DFTBAinDC,,"6c2 is a false claim to US citizenship

INA 212(a)(6)(C)(ii) renders ineligible any individual who, after September 30, 1996, falsely claimed U.S. citizenship to obtain a U.S. passport, entry into the United States, or any other benefit under any U.S. State or Federal law.  According to the BIA, ""a false claim to United States citizenship falls within the scope of INA 212(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) where there is direct or circumstantial evidence that the false claim was made with the subjective intent of obtaining a purpose or benefit under the (INA) or any other Federal or State law, and where United States citizenship actually affects or matters to the purpose or benefit sought.""

Successfully prove that at least one of the following is incorrect:

* The person procured, or sought to procure, a benefit under U.S. immigration laws;
* The person made a false representation; 
* The false representation was willfully made; 
* The false representation was material; and
* The false representation was made to a U.S. government official, generally an immigration or consular officer.

Or, file for a waiver of inadmissability, if she has an immediate relative (parent, spouse, child under the age of 21) who is a US citizen or a green card holder. The I-601 waiver can be applied if you can successfully prove that her being denied admission to the US would cause ""extreme hardship"" to her immediate relatives who are US citizens or LPRs. The waivers can take 1.5-2 years to adjudicate.

You mentioned that your family is in the UK. So that rules out family based immigration.

The job route is not easy at all. Your skills / degree have to be unique or in demand enough that US companies cannot find US resident to do it before turning to foreign labor. Based on your description, it will be very difficult to get a company to sponsor you to work in the US.

That really leaves marriage as the only other route, but at 19 yrs old, that may be premature.

2. To move permanently or for a sufficiently long time you have to get a job that wants to sponsor you for the work visa or for the green card (which usually starts with work visa anyway). Alternatively, you can fall in love and marry a citizen/permanent resident and move through marriage.
3. Getting the work visa is becoming increasingly hard because the lottery gets more and more applications every year but the quota is not increasing, so it might take you at least few years to even get that visa.

We just moved here from Japan. the US embassy in Japan said it wouldnt be difficult for her to come over here at all and start working. But once she got here that proved to be untrue.

I was told to file an I-130 to get her visitor visa extended.

we did not go for a marriage visa because I came here first (we have been together for 5 years now. I came back to the states in October of 2023 and she was able to get here in March of 2024), And we didnt want to wait for a long time for it to get approved. (the US embassy in Japan also said this was fine).

Anyway. Now she is just hanging out with nothing to do and she would like to work. Both so she doesn't feel like she's helpless and also so we can afford to start doing more. But the agents at the US airport told her that if she works while under her visitor visa she can be deported. So I filed for the I-130 to extend her visa stay. so she can then apply for another VISA, such as green card, work visa, or whatever it is we need.

This situation feels pretty unique and its hard to navigate government sites to find an answer given our circumstances. ",2024-05-05T16:47:14+00:00

Although I might recommend talking to an attorney, as it sounds like she entered the US on a tourist visa with the intent to adjust, which is considered immigration fraud. In which case she should return home and wait for the i130 to be approved via consular processing.

immigration,comment,l2pvnpv,HGHUA,,"I have to wonder… OP I think you might need to have her leave the country and file abroad. Seeing as you’re already married but entered on a visitor visa you’ll have a hard time explaining how you didn’t have “immigrant intent” when entering. Aka the bar will be set very high to prove it was not originally intended. What the embassy told you is irrelevant and should not be uttered to USCIS, as its likely to hurt rather then help your case. The likely outcome is even if you get work authorization and advance parole, they’ll both be invalidated the second the 485 is denied. Then you’ll have wasted a year and a half plus filing fees.

DCF as noted is the fastest way but thats super hit or miss. I-130 is about 1-1.5 years out of the country and then immediate green card once you enter the US.

Maybe they thought she was already in the US, which would make adjusting status okay, or that this would happen with the i130/CR1 approved and she’d enter the US on the CR1 which would make her a green card holder upon entry.

However- I used to be a foreign exchange student ion J1 visa n the US (this was pre 9/11 so no fingerprinting neither at visa application nor uppn entering the US.

However I got a US drivers license and was fingerprinted in conjunction with that (TX 2000) 

Now my problem is; will this cause any problem for leasure travel to the US today? - or actually not even with US as end destination but continuing on to Canada (I guess the name change isnt that big of a deal - civil partnership which I can and would be prepared to document)


But will it still cause further concern/flags if my fibgerprints when entering the US dont match my current name? 

(Or ARE even Driving License fingerprints from 2000 connected to US Immigration? Because if not Im definitley not too worried) 

But have just heard horror stories, soooo.   

TLDR; 
1) Any cross-check-ins done with DMV fingerprints from 2020 and US immigration today; concerned due to name change

2) Does having an onward ticket to Canada make any difference in “harshness” (I suppose t doesn’t though - as you are can in principle just skip the Canada ticket once let in, but experiences would still be intersting to hear)

I'm going to assume that your mother is planning on asking your sister to sponsor her (rather than asking her employer to sponsor her in the EB1 category, which would take too long in any case). Note that it is important that you file your I-130 before you turn 21, though that isn't entirely within your control. Based on the timelines and priority dates, you might be able to squeak by if your sister sponsors your mother for the GC and things get processed quickly.

Another thing: if you intend to apply as an unmarried child under 21 of a LPR, you should avoid getting married until you get your GC.

It may take decades for you to get a GC via your sister, so it's not a terribly practical option.

Given the stakes for your immigration prospects, Reddit isn't the best source of advice, and you should consult a lawyer soon. Your mother can talk to the immigration lawyer working on her L1 case.

I’m looking at evidence that he has to submit with the initial I-129F petition. What kind of evidence do we submit? (What evidence do I prioritise)

I have:

- Endless photos of us together
- Photos of me and his family in the USA
- 6 roundtrip trips to the USA (plane tickets, bag tags, ESTAs, flight itineraries/confirmation emails, dates)
- 2 roundtrip trips to the UK (plane tickets, flight itineraries/confirmation emails, dates)
- Holiday/birthday cards from his family to me, my family to his
- Entry forms for a trip to Canada we took together (land entry)
- Hotel reservations
- Train tickets
- Shared rail card (for the UK, with both our names and faces on them)
- PayPal receipts for shared expenses such as hotels 
- Engagement ring, receipt, box

Does anyone have any advice on what to prioritise as evidence, or anything we might be missing ???

OR!! Can anyone let me know how they even presented their evidence? Do I scan/photocopy everything into a big PDF?? 

(I’m British, in England - even though I know I do not file the I-129F myself, I’m the one preparing evidence)

immigration,comment,l2oxtm9,Merisielu,,"Hi there! We just finished the K1 (I’m also British).

For our i129f, we sent a copy of my i94 showing entries to the US, along with signed statements showing the dates of our trips together. We also included a signed statement for the intent to marry. We didn’t include any photos. 

For the I-129f you are simply needing to prove you are able to marry (so, any divorce papers if they  are relevant), you **intend** to marry, and you have met at least once in person. The adjustment of status requires more evidence at the stage you’re showing a bona fide marriage. The I-129f is more of an eligibility assessor than anything else.

You’ve definitely included more than enough! 

The i129f has to be submitted physically (not digitally), so this evidence needs to be added to the envelope packet you send. It needs to have the pages marked appropriately (the USCIS PDF explains how to do that) and have the items marked in the additional pages section at the end.

The US ceremony can be small! Just needs to be legal and with a legal marriage license and certificate. We had planned on me being in the US by September so have a larger family celebration booked for October… but since I was able to come 4 weeks ago (the final stages went way faster than we expected) we are having a quick legal ceremony in a few weeks. Literally an officiant in our backyard with 5 guests. So long as you have that certificate within the 90 days!

immigration,comment,l2ouvfp,Merisielu,,"Firstly, no need to worry.

I went through the London embassy in February for my interview:

Super easy process. It’ll be over in minutes and, in my experience, it was the most simple questions.

In fact, I was surprised with how basic the questions I got were!!

I got to the embassy at 8am. My interview time was 8:30 and the queue already for security was HUGE. You check in at the little podium at the front, and they let you join the queue when there’s 30 mins or less before your appointment.

The security staff were very friendly (literally cracking jokes). I think they appreciate that people are quite on edge. It took 20 minutes to clear the airport-style security.

I went upstairs to where the interviews are. The immigrant visa area was very busy, but the K1 interviews are around the corner and there were only 4 people in that waiting area.

It’s like a bank with multiple windows. You are given a number and go to the window when your number appears on the screen.

The first window is to check documentation. They take your birth certificate, passport, the passport-style photographs, etc. A couple of questions there (mainly name, what visa you’re doing, etc.) and then you sit back down. Again though, I had a really nice and kind person deal with me there.

Then you’re called forward again for the actual interview. You have to raise your hand and swear an oath before answering. Then the questions were:

•You are engaged to a US citizen, correct? And you intend to get married?

•And how did you two meet? What app?

•When did you first meet in person?

•And, I presume, there’s been other meetings since then?

•He’s visited you in the UK?

•Where does your fiancé live in the US?

•You intend to get married there and live there?

•What is his profession?

•We gave you a leaflet at the first window*. Have you read it? Do you have any questions from that?

•Have you had your medical, as I’m missing the report.

And that was enough for him to say he considered my relationship entirely legitimate and my intent to be appropriate for the visa.

The interviews are done at windows like a bank, so you can hear what other people are saying. The guy before me got almost the exact same questions. He was grilled a little more because he made the story about them meeting sound super complicated. The agent questioning him was unsure whether he was taking about virtual reality meetings or in person, so he got more follow-up questions than I did. Basically, the more simple your answers are, the less problem they have.

I took a bunch of extra evidence (photos, invoices for wedding stuff in both names) and didn’t need any of it. Just handed over the required ID, police certificate, and copy of the financial affidavit/my fiancé’s tax return.

*The leaflet is one required by international marriage brokerage law and details how the rest of the K1 works (having to marry within 90 days, etc.) and also the definitions of domestic abuse and how to get help for it.

It really was that straightforward!",2024-05-05T14:20:02+00:00

immigration,comment,l2ouwh2,jchillin757,,Yeah there are unfortunately a lot of easy pitfalls but my fiancee and I have a great lawyer who has been very helpful.

immigration,comment,l2pfw46,Merisielu,,"It is on the PDF of potential questions for both the embassy interview and the adjustment of status interview.

And the later interview(s) are more detailed than the K1 embassy interview. It’s more likely to be asked then. The K1 stage is to establish it’s genuine, you’ve met and intend to marry.

My current H1B is valid until Dec 2024.
I have got a new offer and would like to switch but when I informed about the switch to my current employer they said 1140 cant be transferred and they would have to revoke my 1140 and new employer would have to file my Labor and 1140 again; though my priority date remaining the same.
Need guidance on my situation is this the only way to go? Can my employer transfer my 1140? And if I make a switch will my H1B get extended for 3 years?
As I already have an approved 1140 And if my new employer has to file the Perm and 1140 again then within how much time they can file? This is going to be my first switch after getting my 1140 approved so I am a little worried and confused about my situation.",2024-05-05T13:52:38+00:00

immigration,comment,l2q1mvs,Former_Community_713,,"After getting I-140 approved and you stayed with the company for 6 months then your priority date does not change. You are safe on that side

I-140s is not something which can be transferred and after 6 months of approval cannot be withdrawn either unless there was a fraud to obtain that. Your new employer can file it again if you wish but that will not have any effect whatsoever if the wait time, even if they file after 2 years of your employment it is not going to make any difference because current priority date which is going on is for 2012. You are almost a decade behind that and you will probably see your grand kids getting married before you get chance unless the law changes

H1B extension for 3 years depends on how much time your new employer has requested in your petition, max is 3 years and if that is the duration and there is no issues found in application then yes, you will get a 3 years extension",2024-05-05T18:45:47+00:00

immigration,comment,l2pdch0,arun111b,,"1. After 180 days, your priority date remains same and be ported to new I-140. 

2. After 180 days, even your employer withdraw, it will not affect your new I-140 and also the old I-140 could be used as many time you want to file extension till you are eligible for 485. 

3. You ONLY need new I-140 when your PD becomes current. If you are born in India and applied through EB2 and your PD is 2022 means, it will take 30-50 minimum or never for your PD become current & eligible for 485. 

4. That means you NO NEED to file NEW I-140 whenever you change job or change position in same company. 

5. If your new employer wants to file new I-140 then tell them no need. And,  if they insist then ask them to pay the $$$ they are intent to spend on new I-140 to you as a bonus. 

6. New I-140 is waste of $$$, time for your employer and to USCIS. 

7. Again, you don’t need new I-140 if it revoked or not once you crossed 180 days. 

8. Make sure you get employment verification letter if you are leaving the current job. It might be useful for future jobs or any future immigration applications or documentation. 

9. Finally, this topic is basic and it’s covered extensively in this and also in H1 forum. Basic search on this subreddit would have given you same information. 

10. Final note on immigration, always verify with immigration attorney if you are seeing conflicting information. Everyone’s case is unique and if it’s worked for your friend means it may or may not work or applicable for your case. 

11. GL and all the best for your new job. Stay safe.",2024-05-05T16:18:26+00:00
immigration,comment,l2osm95,not_an_immi_lawyer,,"An employer can revoke or withdraw an I-140 at any time. 

However, if an I-140 has been approved for at least 180 days, it can still be used for H-1B extensions and H-4 EAD even if withdrawn, unless the withdrawal was due to fraud.

It is not mandatory for an employer to withdraw the I-140.

Given that your priority date is unlikely to be current for the next 30 - 50 years, there's really no need for file PERM/I-140 with your next employer - it's a waste of time and money, unless you intend to stay with them for 30 - 50 years.",2024-05-05T14:04:35+00:00

Your best bet is an L-1 visa. You must work for a company outside the US for 1 year in a skilled role (generally meaning a bachelor's degree or higher is required), then the company must transfer you to their US office.

Racism is when you discriminate against someone because of their race. Duh.

Also, It seems that they require high school diploma, do I need to translate it into English? What about my university degree? I guess I don't need that then?

immigration,comment,l2pfllr,just-add-caffeine,,">case number is 29k, how likely that I will get an interview?

In 2023, the cutoff for Europe hit 30,000 in March, so that would have worked pretty well for a 29k case number.

For 2024, the June cutoff for Europe is set to be 21,000. It is still increasing by a few 1000 each month, and can reasonably still reach 30k. But it seems tighter than 2023 for sure.

>Also, to fill out my DS-260, do I need to have my documents ready?

Since DV2024, and also applicable for DV2025, documents will be ""collected and evaluated in connection with the interview"", whatever that means. So you will need them eventually, but not for or directly after DS-260 submission. https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/diversity-visa-2024-update.html",2024-05-05T16:32:25+00:00

I am the lucky winner of Dv-2025 lottery. My case number is 21700. But as soon as I found out I won, I filled out the DS-260 form. I work as CTO.

immigration,post,1cko4t7,AdComprehensive2426,"""Weird"" situation applying for a B1/B2 visa","Hey all. I'm faced with a unique situation on which I couldn't find any reliable answers on Google. I'm hoping someone in this sub can help me out.

I'm currently in the US on an F1 visa and am moving to Germany for work in end-September. However, I want to come back to the US in December for Christmas at a friend's place, and later in January for a conference in Hawaii. So I was going to apply for a B1/B2 visa right after I arrive in Germany.

My questions:
1. Would I be disqualified for not showing enough attachment (not sure of the technical term here) to either my home country or Germany? I can show a rental agreement for a year and my employment contract, but no payslips since I'd be applying almost immediately after I reach Germany.
2. To add on to the above, my original F1 visa was held under administrative processing (221g) and I have an annotation of ""Clearence Received: <DATE>"" on my visa. Would this be considered a previous refusal, and would it cause problems applying for a B1/B2?
3. A more general question, how long would my B1/B2 be valid for? I've heard they usually issue it for 10 years but is that always the case? I would really like a 10 year visa since I don't want to go through the US immigration process again lol. Also, would the validity depend on the reason I'm applying the visa for (visiting a friend vs attending a conference)?

TIA.

Also, need to show you are entering the country for tourism. No ties to your home makes it concerning you would stay and no paystubs would make it look like you would be a burden and search for employment. Based on what you said, probally not good chances but you didnt explain much so its hard to get an accurate portayal of your situation. 
2. No. 221g is a common procedure. What they are interested in is if any visa applications were denied and not given to you.

Whether you have sufficient ties to somewhere outside the US for a tourist visa will depend on the consular officer's judgment.

However, given your prior administrative processing, you will likely have to go through this process again (with an interview, and every time you apply for a visa, regardless of what kind), and a tourist visa will likely be limited to one year. Visa validity is based on reciprocity agreements with other countries and vary by the passport you hold (ten years is the max for a B1/B2), but there are times when they will be limited to reasons other than maximum validity due to security policy.",2024-05-05T11:47:34+00:00

The only thing that changes is that the probability goes from 0 to the tiny probability that it is every year if an application is submitted. With each passing year, the ratio of the sum of ones possible positive outcomes and the sum of one’s possible negative outcomes is roughly the same so where is our disconnect here?

Documents ( court record) submitted and DQed
My original lawyer based in Santa Ana , CA bailed on me and immediately asked for another $5000 to file waiver after he returned from vacation. So began the frantic search for a lawyer experienced in visa refusal/ criminal justice experience. Finally I was recommended to a heaven sent lawyer whom was poised to take my case head on . So far he’s sent inquiries directly to consulate via an attorney inquiry submission and concurrently sent inquiry to legalnet . So far legal net responded to attempt to contact the consulate first to resolve the issue and then communicate with them if the consulate does not respond to two inquiries within their inquiry response . His argument is based on the fact that per immigration legal resource chart on crimes committed in California , vandalism itself is not CIMT however is stated to avoid violence and can mean CIMT if gang enhanced. In my case violence and GH was not noted nor true in my specific case .  Obvious misinterpretation of the law

I’m hoping you all can point me in the right direction. My family used to live in the US a long time ago when I was a child. Eventually we moved back to our home country. Recently one of my parents passed away. I checked one of those unclaimed property websites and saw some funds I could claim. 

When I try to claim the funds, the website asks for my SSN, since I am the claimant. Now I have the SSNs of both my parents, but I believe my sibling and I only have an I-94 number. 

I can ask my other parent to claim the funds, since their SSN is known. Not sure if it matters if they got divorced back in my home country.

immigration,post,1ckl9id,Particular_Bid2906,Good for re-entry?,"Today, my wife received her confirmation that she would get her 10 year green card within 60 days. 

The problem is, my wife’s mother is having a very risky surgery on the 15th, and we’re leaving on the 11th to be with her before/after to recover.

On the note she received today, it said she might not be able to re-enter if she leaves before receiving her green card and may need an ADIT I-551 stamp. However, this is confusing, because my wife has both 2 year and 4 year extension letters (I-797) that extend her green card’s expiration date (originally 2 years). She normally takes those with her when re-entering the country and has had no problems before.

I called USCIS for an appointment for an ADIT stamp, and prompted it for an ADIT stamp, but the automated call system told me repeatedly she didn’t need one.

Is it safe to say that the I-751 acceptance letter has some pre-baked cautionary language urging people not to leave because they may just have expired green cards without any sort of extension? We really need to be there for my mother-in-law and this has us scared.

If you studied in a top 20-30 unversity like Oxford, Tsinghua, ETH Zurich or University of Melbourne, it'll likely be recognized too. However, if the company and/or university is unheard of in the US, it will likely carry little to no weight with US employers.

2. Skills in Excel/Microsoft Project are not something that can be verified on a CV. Some employers like to see related certifications, others don't care for them. Once again, employer-specific.

My lawyer's confusing me and I suspect she's wrong. Can you help see if she's right or wrong?

Background:

I have an international trip in July, but my H-1B1 visa will have expired in June, so I won't be able to re-enter. 

I'm good with internal ""status"" though. My current I-797A has granted me stay/status until August. I also have a pending I-129 Petition for Extension of Stay whose I-797A approval should grant me stay/status till June next year (but it's looking unlikely I'll receive that soon).

Problem:

I want to apply for an H-1B1 visa right now so that I can have it by July, but my lawyer from Fragomen says that if I do it now, it will be ""based on"" my current I-797A that only grants me stay/status until August, so the visa will just be valid for 2 months (July—Aug). My lawyer says I should wait for the pending I-129 Petition to be approved, and then apply for an H-1B1 visa, because then it will be ""based on"" a new I-797A that will grant me stay/status until June next year. Her suggestion is unrealistic because if I wait, the wait time for a visa appointment (2-3 months, best case, because I intend to get my visa from a US embassy in Canada), will take me well past my July trip. So the only realistic option is to apply for an H-1B1 visa now while I have an I-797A that expires in August.

The thing is, it's well known that an H-1B1 is not petition-based, which I take to mean that the H-1B1 visa application (DS-160 + embassy interview) does not require a Form I-129 Petition or its approval, a I-797A, to grant me the visa stamp for entering the US. 

So is what my lawyer said even real? How is an H-1B1 ""based on"" an I-797A approval for an I-129 Petition? Does any part of the visa application process require an I-797A? Does the expiry date of your I-797A dictate the expiry date of your H-1B1 visa? ",2024-05-05T02:14:49+00:00

- An LCA (Form ETA-9035) is most definitely a prerequisite for an H-1B1.
- My understanding is that an approved I-797A is very meaningful when you travel from the US to, say, Europe, and back to the US. At the US port of entry, the H-1B1 visa grants you permission to apply to be admitted, and the I-797A from USCIS (along with the I-94 attached to it) shows CBP the length of valid status USCIS has granted you based on your I-129 Petition. CBP will then update your I-94 online with an admit-until date which is the shorter of:
  - 1 year from that day (default for the H-1B1 HSC status) and
  - the expiration date on the I-94 attached to the I-797A from USCIS",2024-05-05T05:50:20+00:00

I'm currently in the USA on an ESTA, visiting friends.  The total length of this trip is 69 days.  Recently some at-home travel plans have fallen through, which has opened up the possibility that I can return back to the USA for a further 21 days to visit more friends.  I already have a return ticket booked to the UK for the end of this 69 day period.  If I do come back for another 21 days, it will leave only a 16 day gap of being out of the USA.

I am conscious that, whilst technically within the rules, it might raise questions about my intentions.  For background:

* I am a UK citizen and have never had any ESTA/visa revoked
* I have Global Entry so am a member of a trusted traveller programme
* I am employed full time in the UK in a professional role, and I am currently on a 4 month sabbatical break, returning to work on 1st July.
* I have appropriate funds in my bank account to support myself for all this travel.
*  I have no intention to work whilst I am in the USA.  I *am* hoping to move here in the future on a work visa and have applied twice for the H1B lottery (and I made this fact clear during my Global Entry interview, and the officer had no issues with this).

immigration,comment,l2obfqn,BlueNutmeg,,"A job is 1 thing in a long list of ties a person should have. And one of the weakest, because he can walk away from a job. Strongs ties should be more than just one thing. The applicant needs a decent list of ties. 

Family is number 1 in my opinion. I don't mean parents and siblings. This is a HUGE error foreigners make. The US considers family as strong ties as spouse and minor children.

Property/home ownership is the second strongest to me. It shows the person has committed to something significant in their country. A car can be easily sold or left behind. A home, like family, is also difficult to walk away from. 

A job is a good tie but it also more of a supporting evidence that the person is stable. The higher profile of a job and the longer they have been working...the better. I have seen people claiming jobs where they are helping a relative sell food or clothing in the streets. Nothing wrong with that but a manager at an established company that has 10 people working under them is a much higher profile job. 

Social economic standing is also a strong tie. A person making the equivalent to only a few hundred dollars a month would NOT afford a month long trip to the US. It is not feasible. And if they have help from a relative or friend in the US, that makes it worse. It means the applicant has a person to provide for the, if they choose to overstay the visa and find work.

Other factors are their travel history. Like if they have been to other countries and have not overstayed.

immigration,comment,l2n9pgl,HeimLauf,,"You don’t need health insurance to enter, but it’s advisable to have it because healthcare costs in the U.S. are astronomical. If you are moving back permanently, you may want to use www.healthcare.gov to look for insurance (it may redirect you to a state-run website depending on what state you’re living in).",2024-05-05T04:28:41+00:00

immigration,comment,l2m9f7d,None,,You won't need anything except a valid passport to enter the US. Use the US citizen line at immigration. You Indian? I can tell by the way you type haha.,2024-05-04T23:47:52+00:00
immigration,comment,l2m994t,Ok-Importance9988,,"You only need a passport to travel to the US. Some things that you might want to look into are the following. 

If you're a man you need to register for the draft (Google Selective Service) if you haven't already.

If you have ever earned over approximately $10,000 in year you should have filed taxes. Fix this if needed.

Do you know your SSN? Do you have the card.

You are not required to have health insurance but it is very wise to have. How to do that depends on your plans upon arrival.

Are you going to college? Working full time? Does either parent work in the US? If so at your age you can get on their health insurance which will be cheaper.",2024-05-04T23:46:38+00:00

immigration,comment,l2ml09k,None,,">and spent the first 7 years of my life there

This was where I thought this dude might be Indian. Using ""here"" and ""there"" is very common with Indian english

>I need to carry with me other

The word ""carry"" here is distinctly Indian, something my mother would say. Confirmed my suspicion.

>I’d really appreciate any insight.

The sentence sticks out because it's more formal than the rest of the message. Well done, you've exposed yourself as Indian!

Enjoy your trip to America, welcome home!",2024-05-05T01:11:46+00:00

immigration,comment,l2mnlz9,None,,"LMAO! Don't worry about it, most Americans wouldn't pick up on that. My parents are Indian, that's the only reason I can tell.
