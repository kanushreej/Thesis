Conservatives,comment,health care,djjiwa2,IBiteYou,,"I didn't say insurance companies should buy hospitals.  I think we need more competition everywhere.

>Medicaid doesn't make hospitals operate at a loss on its bills...

Au contraire.  At the time I was working in an ER... if someone with Medicaid came in for something minor, like a sore throat, we got to charge about ten bucks.  That's a loss.

There's a reason why docs aren't taking Medicaid patients.  It's because they aren't getting reimbursed enough to make it worthwhile.

So we made the answer more Medicaid patients.

>I can buy a bottle of 1,000 ibuprofen tablets at 200mg for 10 bucks, there is no reason for a three day supply to cost fifty.

Except that written into that cost is the effort it took for the doc to enter the prescription, then the nurse to order it from the pharmacy, then the pharmacy techs to put it together ... then the person to make sure it got up to the floor and the nurses to give it to you according to what was prescribed by the doctor.  There are so many layers to it and employees to be paid.

>A saline bag is even crazier because is just purified water and salt, which you can also buy in a bigger quantity at a tenth the cost. 

You're not proposing that people could do this at home right?  This had to be carefully mixed so it was sterile.  Put in the appropriate bag, all of the prescribing and ordering and was involved AND the nurse has to give it to you through an IV.

>The thing I don't see for health care is how a free market can be created

We used to have what was closer to one.  Health care costs were MUCH lower.

>If healthcare is ran as a for profit institution, the end goal is never going to be how can we provide what's best for those in our care, it's going to be how can we make the most money. 

Why should a doctor not make a profit?  Why should a hospital not make a profit?  That's how it grows.

Liberal,comment,health care,d1z0oex,rainbowrobin,,"Look, if someone went ""an income tax of 10% raises X revenue, an income tax of 100% would raise 10X"", you'd consider that stupid, right?  We've got something similar here.  The hypothetical 0.1% tax, ""minuscule"" though it is, is meant to *change behavior*, radically curbing high-frequency trading.  The author's *10%* tax would radically transform a stock market -- or more likely, kill it, driving it overseas.

> Wealthy investors buying of stocks and bonds is essentially no different than average folks buying food, clothing or other real ""goods and services."" Why shouldn't investors pay a sales tax on financial securities purchases? In the U.S., average households pay a sales tax of 5 percent to 10 percent for retail purchases of goods and many services. So why shouldn't wealthy investors pay a similar sales tax rate for their retail financial securities' purchases?

He ignores how different these things are.  One has to keep buying food and many services; stocks and bonds can be held indefinitely.  They're traded a lot right now, to make money; if you tax transfers at 10% (on top of existing capital gains taxes!) then they'll barely be transferred, or they'll be transferred overseas in some untaxed domain.

> Still too high? Okay, half it again, to a 2.5 percent tax on stocks and bonds and a 0.25 percent on derivative trades. That certainly won't discourage stock and bond trading by the rich

Yeah, I think he's completely wrong about that.

Then he talks about currency transaction taxes.  That's a [Tobin tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin_tax), and as you can see there, the point was to discourage volatility with even a small tax, not to collect tons of money.

And you know?  I was so appalled by his ideas that I'd skipped over some of his numbers.

> US$1.75 trillion in revenue from stock, bonds, and derivatives trades, plus another US$660 billion in forex trade tax revenue, amounts to US$2.41 trillion in total revenue

US GDP is about $18 trillion.  He's talking about raising collected tax revenue by **13% of GDP** -- that's politically insane even with a Democratic Congress, let alone a more likely Republican one -- and doing so by taxing the most mobile of all forms of capital.  Not going to happen.

And our excess health spending doesn't *just* go to insurers and middlemen, much of it goes to very well paid doctors.  Putting everyone on Medicare as it is now would mean a huge income cut for medical professionals, many of whom still have big medical school loans to pay off.

Verhoeven in the other hand was a survivor of the Nazi regime, read a bit of the novel, and due to the pro-military bits was understandable upset with the novel.

Will it be justified? Yes and no. Northam had been doing relatively well in the polls. They have recently taken a sharp dive for two reasons. First, the Latino Victory Fund ad that has been widely viewed and condemned. Utterly tone-deaf and counterproductive. Second, Northam recently came out against sanctuary cities after previously voting against a bill that would have banned them. In response, the activist group Democracy for America called him a racist and withdrew their support for him.

In the space of a few days, Northam has amazingly managed to alienate both the right and the left. If he loses, it will be due to a pretty incredible own-goal.

Democrats were in a pretty good position here, which should make them feel better about 2018.

They have been shut since Chinese New Year. Many major companies will miss their quarterly targets. It’s going to be a shitshow. We don’t know how bad it is.

Regardless, let me reply as if you replied to me 

>How well do you get along with your dad?

Pretty well, I have a pretty great dad. He took me to festivals, he played video games with me when I was younger and has always been a great role model. Why do you ask?

>Wellbeing surveys aren’t exactly “hard science”.

I didn't just cite ""well-being data"" (I think you're trying to refer to the giant meta-study I linked?). 

Though in defense of ""well-being data"" as a concept. When talking about helping peoples general mental health it's generally good to track their mental health. I mean, tracking mental health over time is pretty useful when trying to figure out mental health over time. 

>the fact that most gender dysphoric youths, if given enough time, grow out of it or live as a gay person in the long run.

I'm beginning to think that you didn't read [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/mgjbmy/abhorrent_arkansas_poised_to_deny_trans_youth/gsuxijx?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) at all. I literally had a huge section with plenty of citations discussing that bad myth (even showing where it originated so you could have even stolen the source there)... It's based on some really faulty data..

>I’m very happy for consenting adults to have access to whatever drugs/hormones they want

Based! 

>I encourage you to be trans more power to you

Thanks, but I'm a happy cis!

>Just don’t promote this ideology or these life altering surgeries to young children, please.

Once again, did you ever read [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/mgjbmy/abhorrent_arkansas_poised_to_deny_trans_youth/gsuxijx?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)?! Surgeries are not given to children!!! Not to mention that puberty blockers are safe! 

>Parents have the right to protect their children from these sorts of hostilities.

Considering children pretty much already need parents consent for this in most of the US, I don't see the problem. This is just blocking all health care, even with consenting parents

You complain about data, but I don't remember you posting more than one citation (which I already addressed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/mgjbmy/abhorrent_arkansas_poised_to_deny_trans_youth/gsuqfzt?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) and it didn't exactly say what you claimed it did), do you have any for anything you're saying?!",2021-03-31T03:59:40+00:00

Plaintiffs provide an example: Dr. Hurly “once diagnosed a biological male patient with prostate cancer, but the patient refused to accept Dr. Hurly's diagnosis because he identified as a woman and insisted that he could not have a prostate.” Id. Dr. Hurly “explain[ed] to this patient that he was indeed a biological man with a prostate, and that he needed to seek urgent medical treatment for his prostate cancer.” Id. Plaintiffs claim “Dr. Hurly has treated transgender patients in the past, and he expects to continue doing so in the future.” Id. Plaintiffs further allege: “Dr. Hurly is likely to encounter transgender patients who will deny or dispute their need for health care that corresponds to their biological sex, and he intends to provide care to these individuals in a manner consistent with his ethical beliefs.”

So for example, I have no plan to incentivize preventative medicine beyond the natural costs that apply to both. If someone chooses to pay for reactive medicine, that should be their option, and they should absorb the cost. Because they might be right. Preventative medicine might not be cost-efficient. In the same way, someone who is not prudent with their spending should not be exempt from bankruptcy if they have to take on a big medical cost. Poor and bankrupt is still better than dead.

To answer the rest of your questions, it seems like there's a market for an insurer whose contracts are simpler and easier to enforce.

Here is an example from my life.  Recently, the Biden administration proposed a new rule where past-due medical debt isn't going to be allowed to be reported by credit reporting agencies.  A person (on reddit) said that is a good idea, because then they would be able to qualify for a car loan or a mortgage.  

I said ""If you can't afford to pay your medical debt, why would you want to take on even more debt?""  The person's response was ""F\*\*\* Y\*\*"" (in all caps, evidently in case I didn't get the message when capitalized the usual way).

I actually see this as one of the few problems we don't have to worry about in the long term. 400 pharmaceutical executives signed a letter stating how bad this is.

This effects their bottom line and they have tons of money and political power to fight this. They certainly have some of the best lawyers in the country. And theit main job is normally saving the companies money because they did something evil. It should be easier for them to win when they're actually doing the right thing even if it's for the wrong reasons. 

Think about all the things christo fascists would ban if the fda wasn't a thing. In the letter they asked if judges would now be able to ban vaccines and alzheimers medication.

But really anything could be on the chopping block based on them saying that it's gods plan. I could easily see them banning depression and anxiety meds. Adhd meds, who knows what else. But certainly anything that could help people with mental health problems. Birth control obviously would be banned. It just keeps going. 

And this could be many billions of dollars in losses for these companies. This is the second instance of the GOP going after corporations that I've seen recently. The other is DeSantis and Disney.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,medicine,d3agg1e,Geistbar,,"I think it's a product of multiple successive wave elections.

2006, 2008, and to a lesser extent, 2012, wiped out a lot of republicans that could have been viable candidates. 2010 and 2014 did the same to democrats. Having lost your last election for a lower office is a terrible starting point for a presidential campaign, no matter how justifiable you can make that loss.

Among any group of presidential contenders, you're going to have a lot of duds -- people who just don't connect, despite seeming to be good candidates. For democrats, Clinton was an imposing enough figure that many of the remaining viable candidates (e.g. Gillibrand, Klobuchar, Warner, and Kaine) didn't bother to try.

>Bernie himself said that the primary wasn't rigged.

He also thought that Iowa was above board and the Joe Biden is his friend. Man ain't a fighter, he is nearing 80 and all the fight is out of him. On the other hand, his team disagrees and sued the Democrats infamously in 2016. 

&#x200B;

>[538 saying that the primary wasn't rigged.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-system-isnt-rigged-against-sanders/)

Forgive me if I don't trust their numbers, the polls and models were all f\*\*\*ed up coming out of 2016. While there model was the closest (on the day of the election, others had Hillary winning by 99%) they spent quite a bit of time obfuscating blame and claiming it was the pollsters who f\*\*\*ed up. 

&#x200B;

>[And the Washington Post saying the primary wasn't rigged.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/11/04/no-the-dnc-didnt-rig-the-democratic-primary-for-hillary-clinton/)  
>  
>In reality, the situation is considerably more complex. Brazile’s claims  show that two things are true. First, the DNC preferred Clinton over  Sanders, and provided her campaign with power over the committee in  exchange for financial support. Second, while the DNC preferred Clinton,  this may have had little impact on the actual outcome of the primaries.  
>  
>Throughout the primary process, [the Sanders campaign made several complaints](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/04/17/bernie-sanders-thinks-the-democratic-primary-process-distorts-reality-does-history-back-this-up/?itid=lk_inline_manual_40)  about how the DNC disadvantaged them. On some issues — such as the  timing of some of the primary contests, or the way delegates were  divided over the states — Clinton probably received some benefits.  
>  
>**In short,  two things can be true simultaneously: The DNC tried to help Clinton’s  campaign, but this did not have much impact on whether Clinton won the  nomination.**

Gaslighting 101. They are saying the primary was rigged, but didn't have an impact. (And let's also forget the fact that they ran 16 hit articles against Bernie in 16 hours)

&#x200B;

>[And The Nation saying the primary wasn't rigged.](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/the-democratic-primary-wasnt-rigged/)  
>  
>Nor did superdelegates decide the nomination for Clinton. They gave her a symbolic early lead and momentum,

First off, superdelegates isn't rigging (at least it isn't private rigging) but its hella shady. Yes, yes, they didn't decide the election this time though. Second, this article not once addressed Donna Brazile's claim. 

&#x200B;

>[And Newsweek saying the primary wasn't rigged.](https://www.newsweek.com/myths-cost-democrats-presidential-election-521044)  
>  
>**Start with this: The DNC, just like the Republican National Committee,  is an impotent organization with very little power. It is composed of  the chair and vice chair of the Democratic parties of each state, along  with over 200 members elected by Democrats**

This is an outright lie, the superdelegates can have an incredible sway so they do have power. 

>Next, the infamous hack of DNC emails that ""proved"" the organization  had its thumb on the scale for Clinton. Perhaps nothing has been more  frustrating for people in the politics business to address, because the  conspiracy is based on ignorance. Almost every email that set off the ""rigged"" accusations was from May  2016. (One was in late April; I'll address that below.) Even in the  most ridiculous of dream worlds, Sanders could not have possibly won the  nomination after May 3—at that point, he needed 984 more pledged  delegates, but there were only 933 available in the remaining contests.  And political pros could tell by the delegate math that the race was  over on April 19, since a victory would require him to win almost every  single delegate after that, something no rational person could believe.

Again, pure gaslighting. Its admitting to the leaked evidence of rigging but claiming it had no effect. 

Last, did not address Donna Braziles claims at all.

>  
>Even for the Democratic Party, the past few weeks have  been bizarre. First, Donna Brazile, the former chair of the Democratic  National Committee, [published](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774)  excerpts of a forthcoming book in which she says that after she took  over the Democratic National Committee, she investigated **“whether  Hillary Clinton’s team had rigged the nomination process” through the  DNC, and discovered evidence that they did. “I had found my proof and it  broke my heart,” she wrote.**  
>  
>**In the aftermath of Brazile’s bombshell, Sen. Elizabeth  Warren was asked if she “agree\[d\] with the notion that it was rigged?”  “Yes,” she replied.**  
>  
>**Within a few days, both Brazile and Warren walked their statements all the way back.** Brazile [now says](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/11/05/brazile-says-she-found-no-evidence-that-democratic-primaries-were-rigged-for-clinton/) she found “no evidence” the primary was rigged. Warren [now says ](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/11/09/warren-changes-view-democratic-primary-from-rigged-fair/AFmRnFJlGHs2dBrpISYJwK/story.html)that though there was “some bias” within the DNC, “the overall 2016 primary process was fair.” 

Hmmmmm, changed their minds. Wonder what convinced them of that. 

>The irony is that Sanders was a prime *beneficiary* of this bias, not a victim of it.

Admitting there was bias but claiming that it helped Sanders. Again gaslighting 101.

>It’s easy to bash the DNC’s joint fundraising agreement with Clinton, or [the leaked emails](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/25/12279146/dnc-apology-bernie-sanders)  showing that DNC staffers were supportive of Clinton and frustrated by  Sanders. The DNC is meant to be a neutral presence in party primaries,  and even minor deviations from that position are affronts.

I would call it rigging, but I'm crazy that way. 

>The 2016 Democratic primary wasn’t rigged by the DNC, and it certainly  wasn’t rigged against Sanders. But Democratic elites did try to make  Clinton’s nomination as inevitable, as preordained, as possible
