Geopolitics,comment,antisemitic,k54dfmu,Ritrita,,"Respectfully, you’re wrong. Hamas is there regardless of Israel’s treatment or mistreatment of the people in Gaza. The Hamas charter is openly stating that its aim is to kill Jews and set an extremist Islamic regime in the entire world. I can also share an interview by a son of one of the founders of Hamas to corroborate it first hand. If you’re interested in his perspective. He also wrote a book.  

Another point is that Israel gives Palestinian civilians from Gaza jobs, right of passage to Israel to perform those jobs (tens of thousands of jobs btw), aid (including medical aid), electricity, water etc. none of which they have to do at all, since Gaza is independent from Israel contrary to what people think. Israel can barricade the border completely and let Egypt figure it out instead, but Egypt is not interested in this either. They literally put more cement in the wall this week to ensure no one crosses the border.  
The Arab countries of the world don’t want to offer aid or refuge to the Palestinian people. No one does. They’re stuck under the thumb of the Hamas regime and are being used for propaganda by them. They keep them in state of suffering and they WEAPONIZE the world’s empathy for their own terror infused cause.

Libertarian,comment,antisemitic,ejv8ztj,Cre8or_1,,"I didn't read all of thar because why would I waste my time like that. I do still want to respond to some things. 

Why did the Nazis punish guards who mistreated prisoners? Because they weren't *randomly brutal* , they took brutality and murder to a next level. They planned it. organized it. If some guard in the USA would torture a death row inmate, he would be punished for that (if he got caught). The same thibg happened in nazi germany pretty much. From todays perspective we view this as schizophrenic, but back then it really wasn't.

Why was there a swimming pool (and other nice stuff) in Auschwitz? Well, there could be many reasons. Maybe the guards liked to use them. Maybe they were used as a way to trick inmates into not-revolting upon arrival. Maybe they were featured in advertisement-spots for ""work camps"". Maybe there weren't any and you just made swimming pools up, I don't know.
Some of the things you mentioned were used to keep work moral somewhat high and to entertain the guards (like singing groups).

Why are there laws against denying the holocaust? I agree that those laws shouldn't exist. But they are not evidence for some ""big jewish lie"". seatbelt-laws or vaccination-laws aren't proof that driving without a seatbelt is safer or that vaccines aren't working (""why would you make it mandatory if it's safer, only things that are dangerous need to be made mandatory"")

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,antisemitic,kd2najo,iamrecoveryatomic,,">I think the main issue is if they were asked the same thing about if it's acceptable to protest on campus advocating for the lynching of all Black people (and let's say they limited it to specifically all Black people in ""Southern states"" so that it's technically not targeting the students on campus), every one of those presidents would have had zero issue saying that that behavior constitutes harassment of their Black students.

If they were asked ""lynching all the Jews in Israel"" they'd probably agree that's harassment.

The problem is that the current debate has people who would equate ""Free Palestine"" to how it was used at one point in time in another country to say yup, that means ""lynch all Jews in Israel"" kick them out of college and blacklist them.  A good chunk of people using it mean to free Palestinians from Israeli occupation and blockade, because no matter what Israeli security entails, they are in fact occupying and blockading a group of people in a grossly vile manner.  Which at this point is absurd, you can't even say free an oppressed group/country because people take it to mean genocide of the oppressors?  At this point, even being pro-Palestinian, every phrase is assumed by this side of the debate to be ignorant or veiled attempts at the lives/wellbeing of Jewish students.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,antisemitic,e5k01fo,Enterprise_Sales,,"> I would 100% disagree with any similar agreement being made for any group, including Muslims or more specially Hamas which you are talking about.

My comment is about Labor party and leftist groups that seems so concerned about possible hampering of their ability to call Jews/Israel Nazi, while being pally with organizations that with both their words and action do things that Nazis were infamous for. 

> I think there’s an element of punching down to it. People tend to give more leeway to the weaker of two sides and hence are the ones oppressed by the other. 

That is certainly true and more so for the leftists. However, it requires horse blinders to see Palestinians as the weaker side. From 1948 wars till now, Palestinians aren't alone, but are actively (armies, money, political and diplomatic support) supported by most of the Muslim world. For a lot of people it is a religious fight and not a territorial fight. 

Even for Palestinians the fight has serious religious connotations as in 1948 their army was called Holy army, and for decades they have celebrates martyrs (Shahid), teach value of martyrdom and augment the rewards of afterlife by adding financial benefits of martyrdom on earth as well. 

> I am firmly against all Islamic political organizations, particularly ones like Hamas.

Look at the rhetoric of Corbyn against Jews/Israel/Jewish organizations/""Zionists"", and then compare that with his rhetoric for terrorist organizations like Hamas. You will see a huge disparity in volume, intensity and frequency on those two fronts. 

Alas, as leftists have decided that 1.8 bn Muslims are the Davids in this fight they will ignore terrible words and deeds from the organizations supporting them. ",2018-09-07T13:49:30+00:00

The Prime Minister's office is reportedly spending around £540,000 recruiting more than 500 students to respond to social media posts calling for boycotts and sanctions against the country, the Jerusalem Post says. Those with foreign language skills who receive these scholarships"" would not identify themselves as being in the pay of the government. Instead, Israel's Haaretz newspaper says, the plan is to make the programme appear to be based on the activity of politically-neutral students, with the Prime Minister's Office also hoping to recruit from pro-Israel student groups from around the world. USA TODAY

JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel is looking to hire university students to post pro-lsrael messages on social media networks - without needing to identify themselves as government-linked, officials said Wednesday.

HUFFINGTON POST

Students will be organised into units at each university, with a chief co-ordinator who receives a full scholarship, three desk co-ordinators for language, graphics and research who receive lesser scholarships and students termed ""activists"" who will receive a ""minima' scholarship"",

IRISH EXAMINER

""Haaretz posted what it said were four screen shots of his recent posts. In one of them, Mr Seaman wrote: ""Does the commencement of the fast of the Ramadan mean that Muslims will stop eating each other during the daytime?"" In another, he uses profanity in a comment about the chief Palestinian peace negotiator.""

BEN NORTON

""Mr Netanyahu's aides said the main topics the units would address related to political and security issues, combating calls to boycott Israel and combating efforts to question Israel's legitimacy. The officials said the students would stress Israeli democratic values, freedom of religion and pluralism.""

PEOPLES DISPATCH

'Israel pays thousands of students and pro-Israel activists online to spread favourable propaganda on social media and the larger internet.""

The students making the posts will not reveal online that they are funded by the Israeli government, according to correspondence about the plan revealed in the Haaretz newspaper.

THE SIDNEY MORNING HERALD

""Staffed by approximately 400 student volunteers the project which goes by the name 'Israel Under Fire"", claims to have succeeded in closing anti-lsraeli pages on Facebook and challenging propaganda from Hamas, the organisation that governs the Gaza Strip and whose military arm is firing rockets at Israel.""

A massive number of people in the industrial world went from a farmer to a factory worker. A massive amount of wealth was created but it concentrated into a few hands. A lot of people got left behind in the process and their way of life radicaly changed. We are seeing a similar wealth concentration since the early 1970s. Now with software becoming an increasingly large part of our lives, we are seeing whole industries disappear. We also had trade policies that encouraged manufacturing to move overseas. Then you have environmental laws that have more or less killed whole industries. I think we need to acknowledge a lot of people have and are continuing to be left behind economically.

Would it expand?  Would it threaten to go nuclear?

What role would cyber-warfare play in it?

Implications for the region?  For the world?

I think its something that neither side would want to chance.  For the US, China is not one of the other nations they've kicked around over the past few decades.  China is the most populous nation on Earth, has nukes, and a very substantial military.  Sure, China's military in its current state is no match for the US, but it could still become a blood bath if the war dragged on and widened.
