PoliticalDiscussion,post,minimum wage,qikwwk,vasilenko93,Was the student loan guarantee program a net negative?,"There is a lot of talk recently about student loan forgiveness, college costs, and general burden this all has on students, families, and the economy as a whole. I would like to get people's opinion about a program that I believe caused college costs to rise while also get more people to go to college in the first place.

# The Good

College enrollment has been going up every year since the federal student loan guarantee program went into effect. Millions of mostly poor and underserved students and families could finally afford to get higher education and get another tool to leave generational poverty while at the same time making the US workforce more educated and more productive.

# The Bad

Costs. It is not news to anyone that college is expensive and as a follow-up lots of people are deeply into debt because they went to college. But how does college become so expensive after more students can take on debt? Lets look at historic numbers for reference:

Yale annual tuition in 1970 was $2550 and the minimum wage age was $1.45 an hour while the median household salary was $9,870. I did the math this means tuition for four years at Yale, one of the best and most expensive universities, requires $10,000, or roughly one year of the median income. A family can save 5% of their income (assuming no interest accrued) for 18 years to pay for over 90% of one child’s four year tuition. The rest the child can fund using a part time minimum wage job over the summer or have one-off jobs throughout high school to save up a little too. The numbers get crazy low for state schools which would have tuition at around $500-$700.

Schools cannot charge more than what parents and students had in savings so prices for the average school was kept low enough for middle income parents to afford directly. Today schools can charge more every year (and they do) because no matter what happens the student is approved for a loan and that loan is guaranteed by the government. This is leading to even middle class families being forced to take out loans.

# The Ugly

Its only getting worse. College costs are still rising, and will continue to rise, plus government liabilities for this grow. However any political changes are impossible.

1. Impossible political change: nationalize all colleges to
2. Impossible political change: forgive all debt. This won't fix the problem for future students and it will create a lot of inflation as money that would have went to pay the debt is now able to be spent chasing goods and services (raising their prices)
3. Impossible political change: get rid of the student loan program, forcing parents and students to pay for college directly or take out private loans

Neoliberal,post,sales tax,hyx949,FireDistinguishers,Congressional Procedure 104: The Budget,"### Introduction
I'm an LC in the Senate. Despite the fact that I can't tell you whose staff I currently work on, I *can* say that I started out on the Hill as an intern for Senator Chris Van Hollen from my home state of Maryland. I really loved that office, and honestly I'd love to go back to it as a permanent staffer, but that's a story for another time.

I'm bringing up Senator Van Hollen because he, like Senator Mikulski whom he succeeded, is a member of the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations, a very prestigious group of human beings dedicated to combining two absurdly complicated things (the Federal budget process and Senate procedure) into an absolute hell of a fun ride. Working alongside the staff of an appropriator is a rare honor among rare honors, because it gives you a front row seat to one of the most critical functions of America's legislature.

That being said, despite the fact that there have been relatively consistent mainstream discussions about the Federal budget since the end of the Clinton administration (mostly discussions about the Federal deficit at that) I'm genuinely surprised to hear that many people I talk to can't identify basic details about how the budget is enacted every year. 

So, if you want a better understanding of what happens when Congress passes the budget, either to filter through the news or just because you find it interesting, I hope this post can give you some insight into what's happening on the Hill when money is involved.

### The Fiscal Year
The Federal government's fiscal year in the United States (FY20XX) runs from October 1, 20XX-1 to September 30, 20XX. To make that more clear, the current fiscal year is FY2020, which started on October 1, 2019, and will end on September 30, 2020.

Why is the fiscal year not just the calendar year? Well, I've heard doing things like this was thought up to ensure that funding for Federal government activities could be secured before an election, and before the inauguration of a new Congress. I've also heard this nonsense has something to do with the growing cycles of Cotton and Tobacco. In that scenario, having a fiscal year that ends in the middle of the calendar year gave select plantation-owning Members of Congress a way to spend time at home while they were overseeing the harvest and sale of their crops, all without having to worry about missing key votes relating to the budget. That kind of thinking makes more sense when you consider the fiscal year used to run from July 1 to June 30, meaning the early Republic's budget was long secured by the yearly harvest season. Maybe it's both of those things, maybe it's neither (honestly I don't even know when tobacco and cotton are harvested) but regardless of *why* this is the case, ever since the [Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/93/hr7130/text) the calendar year starts in October. That's just how things are.

### The Agency Negotiation Period
Most sources will say that the budget cycle begins in February when the President submits his (or, someday, her) budget request, but that isn't entirely accurate. At *least* 18 months before the fiscal year begins (meaning before April 1, 20XX-2) the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) starts work with the Federal agencies to establish specific policy directions and planning levels to guide the preparation of *their* budget requests. Again, to make this more clear, OMB and the Federal agencies started working on the current (FY2020) budget before April 2018, and right now the agencies are working on the budget for FY2022.

At the start of this part of the process, the President, the Director of OMB, and other officials in the Executive Office of the President work to understand the current budget for this fiscal year, they react to the currently proposed budget that will go in effect for the next fiscal year, and they evaluate program performance within the Executive Branch. Also around this time economic outlook projections are prepared jointly by the Council of Economic Advisers, OMB, and the Treasury Department, and those projections become part of the conversation when they're available.

In early fall, usually after Congress comes back from August recess, the agencies submit their budget requests to OMB, and OMB analysts review the requests to identify issues that OMB higher-ups need to discuss with agency higher-ups. Sometimes OMB and the agencies negotiate things down on their own, but other times the White House upper echelon has to get involved. Regardless of how the numbers come to be, this part of the process is usually finished by late December, giving the White House one full month, and a few days remainder, to finally complete the President's budget request.

**Here's why this is important:** Members of Congress pay close attention to what the agencies want and need for their programs, because people and groups who depend on those agencies, for whatever reason, will be somebody's constituent. If you're a Member of Congress and you have: a Military base, a National Lab, a University, a Fortune 500 company, a NASA launch site, an interstate highway, or any number of other things in your district, the agencies' opinions matter to you. That's every Member of Congress, by the way, somehow and in some way they all *should* care, and most of them *do* care (only a few really egregious offices skip out on listening to agency comments). At the staff level, it's very common for junior and senior staff working for an appropriator to spend a lot of time looking at what the agencies relating to their portfolio would like to see as budget season approaches, collaborating with staffers on the various appropriations subcommittees along the way. Essentially, if you're working for an appropriator, there's *always* this looming budget work to be done.

### The President's Request
According to the [Budget and Accounting Act of 1921](https://govtrackus.s3.amazonaws.com/legislink/pdf/stat/42/STATUTE-42-Pg20.pdf) the President must submit a budget request every year. [Title 31, Section 1105, of the U.S. Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/1105) has the due date for this request set ""on or after the first Monday in January but not later than the first Monday in February of each year."" That's within one year of the budget going into law by the way, so the President's budget request for FY20XX will go live in February 20XX-1. To make it more concrete again, this February the White House released the President's FY2021 budget request.

Sometimes Congress doesn't pay attention to this thing (recent budgets, for example, entirely ignore some of the President's program consolidation requests, look into what the White House wanted to do with Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants (Title IV, Part A) if you want more information on what that looks like). Most of the time, though, this becomes a partisan process wherein the President's opposition makes whatever budget they want with no regard to the President's budget and the President's party tries to strike up a balance between those figures and the figures the President put forward.

### Authorizations
If you work in the Senate you can check Webster for the official Senate glossary of terms to find this definition: 
> Authorizations Act - A law that establishes or continues one or more
> Federal agencies or programs, establishes the terms and conditions
> under which they operate, authorizes the enactment of appropriations,
> and specifies how appropriated funds are to be used. Authorizations
> acts sometimes provide permanent appropriations.

I'm sure this is on the regular senate.gov site, but I can't find it. I'm sorry.

The passing of authorizations acts is technically the first part of the appropriations process in Congress, because they can predate the Federal budget that's currently in debate by a number of years (because most of them establish multi-year programs). Some authorizations, though, need to be renewed every year, like the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that authorizes (you guessed it) defense programs.

Both chambers can produce authorizations, and basically every Member of Congress has the power to propose one of these kinds of bills, but other budgetary legislation is more exclusive.

### Views and Estimates
Six weeks after the President's budget request comes in, and God knows how long after any particular authorization act passes, every single Congressional Committee is required to submit “views and estimates” of spending and revenues within its oversight jurisdiction to the House and Senate Budget Committees. 

The views and estimates, along with information from other sources, are used by each Budget Committee in drafting and reporting a concurrent resolution on the budget to its respective chamber. The ""information from other sources"" I mentioned in that sentence is info gathered by the Budget Committees in reports and hearing testimony, and it usually consists of economic projections, programmatic information, and budget priorities. Those kinds of things come from a variety of sources, like the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Congressional Research Service (CRS), OMB, the Federal Reserve, Executive agencies, and Congressional leadership.

### The Budget Resolution
The budget resolution is a concurrent resolution (meaning it's made it past both chambers a set of with thumbs ups). It represents an agreement between the House and Senate establishing budget priorities, and defining the parameters for all subsequent budgetary actions. You can treat it like Congress' official response to the President's budget request.

The budget resolution isn't binding, and technically it's not even part of the law. Instead, it's mostly a way to get both chambers of Congress onboard with more general aspects of the Federal budget, like its overall size, and its general composition in terms of functional categories. Functional category numbers are a topic of conversation a lot because these numbers get translated into allocations to each Committee with jurisdiction over spending in a process called “crosswalking” under Section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act. I'll talk about that more in the ""204"" post (if I ever make one), but everybody likes to throw around the ""crosswalking"" term for whatever reason, so just know this is the part of the process they're talking about.

When the budget resolution is ready in each of the chambers, it goes to a Conference Committee like any big bill. When it's in there, differences between the House and Senate versions are resolved and the final unified version is sent back to each chamber so it can be voted on. 

""But u/FireDistinguishers,"" I hear you asking, ""it's not like both chambers send all their Members to negotiate the resolution. What if the reconciled version comes back it doesn't pass in one, or both, of the chambers?""

Great question. This *is* one possible fork in the road that might take Congress into a ""We need some Continuing Resolutions"" type of year. What makes it worse is that the [Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (the CBA)](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/93/hr7130/text), that made the rule requiring Congress pass a budget resolution, set this thing's due date on tax day: April 15th. Since FY1977, though, Congress pretty frequently misses the due date, and in a few pretty recent years (FY1999, FY2003, FY2005, FY2007, FY2011-FY2015, and FY2017) Congress didn't adopt a budget resolution at all.

Is that a bad thing? Kind of. There's no *direct* penalty on Members of Congress if the budget resolution isn't completed before April 15, or not at all, but there are ramifications to both of these scenarios. 

For example: certain enforceable spending ceilings associated with the budget resolution aren't established until the budget resolution is completed, mixing the process up a bit when the budget reaches the House and Senate floors (more on that later). The CBA also prohibits both House and Senate floor consideration of appropriations measures for the upcoming fiscal year before Congress completes the budget resolution and, in the Senate, before the Senate Appropriations Committee receives its spending ceilings. The CBA does allow the House to consider most appropriations measures after May 15, though, even if the budget resolution has not been adopted by Congress, and the Senate can adopt a motion to waive this CBA requirement for spending ceilings by a majority vote. More broadly too, if Congress delays completion of the annual budget resolution (or skips adopting one outright), each chamber can adopt a deeming resolution to address these procedural difficulties, essentially saying ""yeah we don't want to play by the rules this year."" That's usually an option that's taken when the majority party in both chambers is the same, and the majority party just doesn't want the minority party obstructing the process.

### The Appropriations Committees

There are 12 appropriations bills:
 - Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and
   Related Agencies
 - Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies
 - Defense
 - Energy and Water Development 
 - Financial Services and General Government 
 - Homeland Security 
 - Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies 
 - Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies 
 - Legislative Branch 
 - Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies
 - State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs
 - Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies

These bills share their names with the subcommittees within the House and Senate appropriations committees that hold oversight of the bill's jurisdiction. Starting in May (for the House) and June (for the Senate) these subcommittees hold hearings to gain information about their particular bill. That info comes from in-person testimony, written testimony, and reports from CRS, the CBO, and sources within the Executive Branch. After they conduct these hearings, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees (the full committees now) make their suballocations, and the subcommittees begin to draft, mark up, and report the regular bills under their jurisdiction to their respective full committees. As of the day this post goes live, this is something that's currently happening in the Senate. Both the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee consider each of their subcommittee’s recommendations separately, and the committees can adopt amendments to a subcommittee’s recommendations prior to reporting the bills and making them available for further consideration by their respective chambers.

From a functional standpoint you have to remember that if you're a Member of Congress on the full committee, you're in one or more subcommittees. What that means is it's not like subcommittees and full committees are two separate groups here, in essence the people who negotiate at the subcommittee level need to report their work to themselves, while specifically courting the favor of their colleagues who weren't at the negotiating table with them. In the Senate, since the full committee is relatively small, Senators find themselves on a significant number of subcommittees. My old boss Senator Van Hollen is the most junior Senator on the minority side of the Appropriations Committee (meaning he has the least clout of anybody up there), but he still serves in the subcommittees on the Legislative Branch; Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies; Financial Services and General Government; the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies; and State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs. That's 5/12, not bad for the lowest ranked person up there.

This is a sticky part of the process nonetheless. One wrong turn and somebody goes into dissent over some number somewhere and the bills need more time to get negotiated. That being said, bills love getting stuck in the next step of the process.

### Floor Consideration: [Where the Fun Begins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAHLwAxS7FI)

**Part 1: The House of Representatives**
When the House is considering a bill on the floor (remember there are 12 of these things, categories listed above), they do this thing where they set up a committee called ""Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union"" ( which usually gets shortened down to ""the Committee of the Whole""). Every Member of the House of Representatives is a member of the Committee of the Whole, and when they're together like this there's a special rule for appropriations bills that provides for one hour of general debate on the bill in question. General debate includes opening statements by the Chair and Ranking Minority Member of the appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the regular bill, and comments from other interested Representatives.

One hour is a short time, but that's because most of the floor process isn't spent on general debate. See, after the Committee of the Whole exits general debate, it considers amendments. That's when appropriations bill is read for amendment, paragraph by paragraph, and Representatives can jump in to add an amendment when the reading gets to where the amendment would go.

There are a series of restrictions on amendments to appropriations bills, like ""House standing rules and precedents requiring amendments to be germane to the bill,"" for example, or ""Spending limits imposed by the congressional budget process"" (that shit from the budget resolution).

Alongside these two examples, there's a whole list of different reasons an amendment could be out of order, and if one amendment *is* out of order then any Representative can raise a point of order to call that out. These points of order aren't self-enforcing. A Member has to raise a point of order that an amendment violates a specific rule, and then *if* the presiding officer rules the amendment out of order, it cannot be considered by the House. Also, a special rule or unanimous consent agreement can waive requirements imposed by House rules or the budget process, thereby allowing the House to consider the amendment. Again, Congress decides what rules to play by.

After the Committee of the Whole completes consideration of the measure, it rises and reports the bill and any amendments that have been adopted to the full House. Then the House votes on the amendments, and final passage of the bill. After House passage, the bill gets sent to the Senate.

**Part 2: [The Senate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MHusGl9BeM)**
There's a pretty new practice going on where the full Senate considers the text of a bill as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee in the form of a substitute to the House-passed appropriations bills. It's a fun way to make sure the budget doesn't pass on time.

Unlike in the House, the Senate doesn't have a Committee of the Whole. There's only 100 people in there, though, so it really doesn't matter. When the bill is brought up on the floor, the Chair and Ranking Minority Member of the appropriations subcommittee responsible for the bill in question make opening statements on the contents of the bill as reported. Instead of going paragraph by paragraph and amending the bill, a sensible but time-consuming process, Senators can propose amendments to any portion of the bill at any time it's pending unless the Senate agrees to set limits. This way of doing things makes the amendment process faster but harder to keep track of, and it's only possible because there are differences in House and Senate procedure. See, bills in the Senate can be ""in consideration"" but not currently the topic of discussion, it's something I don't really understand I'll be honest with you.

Committee and floor amendments to the bills in question have restrictions just like they do in the House. Amendments need to meet requirements established under the Senate standing rules and precedents, and the congressional budget process, as well as any requirements agreed to by unanimous consent. The specifics of the Senate and House rules for general appropriations bills are a bit different, including the waiver procedures, but just like the House, the Senate cares quite a bit about the enforcement of spending limits in particular. 

For the most part the chambers do the same thing, and you only run into differences because of complications in Senate procedure, but that's a topic for another time.

### Conferencing
The Constitution requires that the House and Senate approve the same measure with precisely the same provisions before it can be presented to the President for his (or, someday, her) signature or veto. This means that once the House and Senate have both completed initial consideration of one out of the 12 appropriations measures, the Appropriations Committees in each chamber will sit down and negotiate a resolution of the differences between their respective versions.

Generally, the House and the Senate convene a conference committee to resolve differences between the versions of the various appropriations bills. Alternatively, agreement can be reached through an exchange of amendments between the chambers, but this is less common. Nowadays, the Senate typically passes the full House bill, with the Senate version attached as a single substitute amendment. As a result, the House and Senate resolve their differences based on disagreement on the entire measure. Members of the House and Senate appropriations subcommittees having oversight jurisdiction over the appropriations bill in question, as well as the chair and ranking minority members of the full committees, are designated as conferees or managers and they meet to negotiate over differences between the versions of the bill.

There are restrictions on what these guys can do when they're conferencing, specifically that conferees have to negotiate within the scope of the differences on those matters in disagreement, and not just start creating new nonsense to add to the bills while they're in agreement with each other.  Once conferees reach agreement on all points of difference, they write up and sign a conference report, which proposes a new conference substitute for the bill as a whole. Completion of the conference report isn't on a specified timeline, so negotiations only conclude when a majority of the conferees from each chamber sign the conference report. When that happens, a joint explanatory statement (sometimes called a managers’ statement) is drafted up explaining the new substitute bill. These conference reports can't be amended when they get back to either chamber.

The first chamber to consider the conference report (which is usually the House, but sometimes it's the Senate) can vote to: adopt it, reject it, or recommit it to the conference for further consideration. After the first chamber adopts the conference report, the conference is automatically disbanded, so the second chamber has two options: adopt or reject the conference report. In cases where the conference report is either rejected or recommitted to the conference committee, the two chambers need to negotiate further over the matters in dispute because, of course, the measure can't be sent to the President until both houses have agreed to the entire text of the bill. This can take months, and it's probably the most frequent reason for the budget not passing before October 1st.

### Presidential Action
When budget bills *do* pass in both chambers, they stop behaving in extraordinary ways and they end up like any other bill: presented to the President, awaiting a veto or a signature. All the standard rules apply here: the President can Pocket Veto a bill, Congress can override a veto with a two-thirds majority in both chambers, the President can sign the bill, it's nothing fancy at this point.

### ""Special"" Scenarios

**Stopgaps**
The last time Congress and the President respectively passed and signed all 12 budget bills before October 1st was in 1996. I was born in 1998. I have never lived to see this shit happen, which is kind of crazy when I think about it but that's beside the point. When Congress and the President don't hit the October 1st deadline, they have two options at their disposal: let part or all of the Government shut down, or pass some Continuing Resolutions (CR). 

Aside from the official name, these things are called Stopgaps, and they serve to make sure there is funding for Federal activities while Congress works on passing the budget bill related to that activity. These resolutions have a term of expiration, maxing out at a full fiscal year but usually lasting somewhere in the ballpark of 6-12 weeks, and technically they can give agencies and programs any amount of money. What that implies is that certain Federal agencies and programs could be shut down even if a CR is active, which is part of the reason agency folks hate these things so much.

**Omnibus Bills**
There are 12 budget bills, but sometimes Congress passes one or more omnibus bills instead of going through each of the 12. Omnibus bills can serve the role of being one giant bill that funds everything the 12 bills would have funded, or they can just be the combination of two or three of the 12 budget bills. [CRS keeps a public tracker](https://crsreports.congress.gov/AppropriationsStatusTable?id=2020) of all 12 budget bills by the way, so you can see that for the FY2020 budget there were a number of these ""Consolidated Appropriations Acts"" that made their way into law, providing funding for all 12 categories.

### Conclusions

There are a lot of ways the budget can go off the rails. For a pretty long time there's been a desire from people in Congress and in the Executive branch to switch to a two year budgeting system, essentially requiring each inaugurated Congress to pass one budget instead of having each Congress pass one budget for its first session and one in its second session. It's a plan that I'm a pretty big fan of personally, but for whatever reason it's just not a big priority. Maybe it should be. I'd like to hear your thoughts on that.

Another edit: u/throwawaydhs999 made an excellent comment on the Budget process from the agency side of things which I definitely think deserve highlighting. I've never worked in a Federal agency, so all of the information above on what OMB and the agencies do is textbook. A first-hand account, though, like the one in the comment below definitely needs to be showcased.

>Thorough write up! I spend several years involved in the budget process at DHS in the executive branch.

>Around January 20XX-2, OMB would give us vague guidance for how much the Department could submit in the upcoming FY20XX budget. The Department would then do the same to the subagencies, and they would have 2 months to submit their plans to the Department. However, usually subagencies would have already started that work in Fall 20XX-3. Then the Department leaders would make decisions on what to fund around summer, and send that to OMB around September as you said. Sometimes OMB will change their guidance at random based on what the WH wants.

>My takeaways from being a part of it were, firstly, the process is too intensive in the current political climate. Congress doesn't really care that much, they will fund whatever they want. Secondly, no agency will admit they need to change or reduce. Thirdly, I'm more wary of news reports saying, ""the (President's) Administration wants to do X"". Most of the decision making is decentralized, and sometimes an agency proposes a ""poison pill"" cut precisely because they know it won't happen but need room to add another request to the budget. But more importantly, the current administration is so incompetent that what they say they're considering is mostly ignored by Congress and civil servants. Lastly, the sunk cost fallacy is very real. Lots of ineffective or unnecessary programs continue simply because they've already been started. There are always the lower-level people trying to fix the situation, but most leaders (executive and congressional) won't admit failure.",2020-07-27T17:57:32+00:00,
Geopolitics,post,tax,c5tiqw,gnikivar2,The Empire Strikes Back: The Political Economy of El Sisi's Egypt,"On February 11th, 2011 Hosni Mubarak, president and dictator of Egypt for 30 years, was forced to step down from power by a mass protest movement. It was a heady and hopeful time in the Middle East as dictators in Tunisia, Libya and Yemen were forced from power. However, this hope quickly faded as the elected Muslim Brotherhood dominated government of Mohammad Morsi [struggled ](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/07/why-egyptians-are-so-unhappy-with-morsi-in-one-chart/277511/)to manage security and the economy, and the military stormed back to power. The new military dictator, Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi reinstated an autocracy more oppressive than what had preceded before. In today's podcast episode, I will be discussing the political economy of the Arab Winter in Egypt. In part one, I will discuss the economic reforms instituted by Al-Sisi's government and their success in reinvigorating the Egyptian economy. In part two, I will discuss how the benefits of these economic reforms have disproportionately accrued to a narrow class of military officers. Finally, in part three, I will discuss the weak political underpinnings of Egypt's recent economic success.

The Egyptian economy in early 2014 was in a dire place. GDP growth in 2013 was [only ](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=EG)2.2%, barely above the rate of population growth, the budget deficit [soared ](https://tradingeconomics.com/egypt/government-budget)to 13.3% of GDP, and unemployment soared to [13.6](https://tradingeconomics.com/egypt/unemployment-rate)% of the population.

Moreover,, the government implemented a [7.5](https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20150928/business/309289907)% VAT tax, while [slashing ](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/03/28/millions-of-retiring-arab-civil-servants-need-not-be-replaced)government payrolls.

GDP growth is expected to [rise ](https://www.reuters.com/article/egypt-economy/egypt-expects-58-pct-economic-growth-in-q4-of-fy-2018-19-minister-idUSL5N22K49V)to 5.8% a year 2019, and accelerate to over 6% a year. The [budget deficit](https://www.reuters.com/article/egypt-economy/egypt-targets-budget-deficit-of-72-pct-gdp-growth-of-61-pct-in-fy-19-20-minister-idUSC6N20K010) and unemployment rates are steadily decreasing, while manufactured exports have [increased ](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/05/egypt-imf-revision-loan-industrialization-exports.html)by more than 24% since the devaluation. However, prices of every day consumer staples have soared for people at all levels of society, and in the short term these reforms have been incredibly painful.

The reforms are especially galling given that the austerity isn't being felt equally by all levels of society. Although the military has played a large roll in the Egyptian economy since the start of the military dictatorship in 1952 under Gamal Abdel Nassar, However, under Al-Sisi the military's economic role has grown rapidly. The military is investing in everything from [luxury hotels](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=c8fkXMyBB8KA5wKdnar4BA&q=egpyt+military+luxury+hotel&oq=egpyt+military+luxury+hotel&gs_l=psy-ab.12..33i22i29i30l10.245.6743..7475...0.0..0.219.3372.2j25j1......0....1..gws-wiz.....0..35i39j0i67j0i131j0i20i263j0j0i10i67j0i10j0i13j0i13i10j35i304i39j0i22i30j0i8i13i30j33i160j33i299.8YPq1s7GfqU) to [fish farms](https://ww.egyptindependent.com/egypt-to-build-largest-fish-farm-in-middle-east/) and revenue for the Ministry of Military Production have increased five fold over the last five years.

These advantages are most blatant in large white elephant schemes the El-Sisi government has promoted. For example, the government has invested $8.5 billion in [expanding ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33800076)the Suez Canal based off off what many experts consider overly rosy projections on profits. However, because the Suez Canal is under armed forces [supervision](https://www.businessinsider.com/egypts-authoritarian-president-is-celebrating-the-completion-of-an-8-billion-suez-canal-expansion-that-nobody-asked-for-2015-8), many of the contracts for building the canal went to military linked firms. Similarly, the government has announced the construction of a new capital city to address overcrowding in Cairo. It is estimated that building this new capital will cost $45 billion, and given the firm overseeing the project is 51% controlled by the military, individuals and companies linked to the armed forces will likely have many [opportunities ](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/01/24/egypt-prepares-to-open-its-grand-new-capital)to acquire wealth.

El-Sisi's decision to promote the economic interests of the military might make little economic sense, but has a clear political logic. El-Sisi has moved harshly against all of his external opponents. El-Sisi [massacred ](https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/08/12/all-according-plan/raba-massacre-and-mass-killings-protesters-egypt)817 peaceful civilian protesters affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood in the immediate aftermath of his coup, and it is estimated that at one point there were 60,000 [political prisoners](https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/09/28/we-are-tombs/abuses-egypts-scorpion-prison) in Egypt. The primary threat to the regime comes from within the military itself, but it appears that his promotion of military economic interests has bought their loyalty. However, this doesn't mean that El-Sisi faces no opposition. The public is seething about the rising cost of living, although protests have to date been largely [sporadic](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-economy-protests/egypt-beefs-up-security-outside-metro-stations-after-fare-rise-protests-idUSKCN1IE0K7). Although the government has, in accordance with IMF recommendations, expanded targeted welfare programs to protect the poor. However, these programs, against IMF [advice](https://timep.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/TIMEP-EET-report_10-29-18-mks-edits-new-1.pdf), have not been nearly ambitious enough to keep millions falling deeper into poverty. This has created a pressure cooker environment where many have become radicalized. There has been a spate of [brutal ](https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/25/africa/egypt-sinai-mosque-massacre/index.html)terrorist attacks throughout Egypt, and a low intensity guerrilla war against Al-Qaeda in the Sinai peninsula has [cost ](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/sinai-insurgency-next-isis-crisis)the lives of thousands. Moreover, while El-Sisi's grip over the military is strong, and he is currently in good health, transitions of power in military regimes are inherently fraught.

In conclusion, although Egypt has implemented reforms that have spurred an acceleration of economic growth, the fact that the military has disproportionately profited from this growth has resulted in weak political underpinnings to this regime. The oppressive attitudes towards human rights are more of a sign of weakness than strength. In recent months, the Arab world has seen another wave of revolutions with popular protest movements unseating longstanding dictators in Algeria and Sudan showing that the people still have the power to overthrow a regime. However, the bloody reignition of civil war in Libya is a reminder that the fall of a regime can bring chaos even worse than dictatorship. The leaders and people of Egypt will have to chart a course through dangerous waters, and the fate of 101 million people depends upon their ability to do so.

The general (right) Libertarian argument against taxation is that the State is (at gunpoint) taking value that *you* generated through *your* labor and redistributing according to how it sees fit. Whether this is morally equivalent to highway robbery or not is up for the debate but it's a logically consistent view that makes sense to me. 

It also doesn't apply to the Inheritance Tax at all. If I'm Bruce Wayne and my rich parents die in a mugging gone wrong, I have done *nothing* to earn the wealth I will inherent. I am essentially being rewarded for being lucky. I did no labor, I generated no value, I did nothing to improve to society other that pop out of right uterus that entitles me to that money. 

Since the inheritor has no moral right to the money, I would argue that it should be as high as possible - you can use that to fund social services. This does a great job of ensuring maximal equality of opportunity while doing *nothing* to enforce a  particular ""equality of outcome"" for living people. 

The inheritance tax is not theft because the only person who had a ""right"" to that wealth has died and gone beyond where it's of any use to them. You could argue about what the deceased ""would have wanted"", but they're dead. If they complain about it, then I'll listen.",2021-09-27T00:38:48+00:00,

#General Introductions

Having two countries in a post is awkward as there aren't enough countries to justify using a spreadsheet for the introductions, yet writing full essays for each of them, like for regional powers, would be excessive--this is why I decided to write two mini-essays that will cover all of the most central points. Feel free to consult the spreadsheet linked below for more information.

&nbsp;

**Mexico**

The country's population is projected to peak around 2060, then decline. Its peak population is projected to be roughly a third larger than its current population, while its population by the end of the century is projected to be roughly 20% larger. The country's population pyramid reflects its status as a developing country, as it has a bottom-heavy profile, meaning that a large portion of the population is young. The pyramid is projected to lengthen and flatten throughout the remainder of the century and it seems likely that only very mild problems related to population aging will appear. 

Mexico has a high GDP (PPP) of $2.5 trillion, ranking 11th among all countries. Despite having a relatively high GDP (PPP) per capita of $19,900 compared to Latin American countries, more than 47% of the Mexican population lives below the poverty line. Because of the significant challenges posed by climate change, which will be discussed below, it is likely that the country's wealth, development, and wealth distribution will significantly hamper efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.

Agriculture is considered one of the most threatened sectors in Mexico, as the projected increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation will lead to fewer crops being as suitable for the country and to significant declines in yields of major crops like maize, beans, coffee, sugarcane, and wheat. Despite this, many studies suggest that severe food security issues are not likely within the next 40 years.

In contrast, there is broad consensus that water security will be a significant vulnerability going forward, as water deficits increase due to the decline in rainfall and the salination of freshwater reserves due to sea level rise, and depletion of aquifers. The state of Baja California, located in the country's northwest, is likely to be the most affected.    

&nbsp;

**Canada**

The country's population is projected to rise throughout the remainder of the century, with a slight deceleration around 2035. By 2100, the population is projected to be roughly 50% larger than its current figure. This increase is unlikely to put any significant strain on the sparsely populated country's resources. The country's population pyramid is relatively flat and slightly skewed towards older age groups, reflecting the country's status as a developed country. The pyramid is projected to further lengthen and flatten over the remainder of the century and it seems likely that very mild problems related to population aging will appear.

Canada has a relatively high GDP (PPP) of 1.8 trillion, ranking 17th among all countries. It has a high GDP (PPP) per capita of $48,400. As a country that's developed, relatively wealthy, abundant natural resources, and geographically positioned to benefit from the opening of the Arctic, Canada is unlikely to have trouble mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change, even if the challenges posed were significant.

Climate change presents both challenges and opportunities to food producers, as the northern country's climate becomes more suitable to a larger range of crops with higher value since the growing seasons would be longer and warmer. However, this will also lead to new and increased pests and diseases. As temperatures are expected to rise dramatically in the North, inhabitants in those areas might see significant disruptions to their food supplies.

Because of the country's massive freshwater reserves, it is extremely unlikely that the country will experience water security issues even when accounting for potential reductions in the quality and quantity of water due to changes in temperatures and precipitation. However, there are concerns about the increased incidence and intensity of extreme weather events, such as storms, disrupting water infrastructure and contaminating water supplies.

Conservative,post,sales tax,1zo5c0,TeaPartyArmy,War with Russia Raises Concern,"By: Charles Benninghoff

When it comes to the Ukraine-Russia crisis, two things are for sure. 

First, it has absolutely nothing to do with the United States, our resources, our national security or our economy. 

Second Obama, the neo-cons and other war-mongering politicians are perfectly willing to send YOUR children, not their children, off to die in this conflict.

Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are threatening sanctions (which are an act of war) against Russia. When discussing how to carve up the post-democratic Ukrainian nation in a way that would best benefit Obama’s hunger for power, Obama's Assistant Secretary of State, Victoria Nuland, said ""F*** the E.U."" 

That just highlights the low lifes that are on Obama’s foreign policy team. 

Do not be fooled by Mr. Putin's apparent backpedaling. Russia by treaty is allowed to have 25,000 troops stationed in Ukraine. He now only has 16,000. Russia also has a long-term lease in Ukraine's port of Sevastopol to provide its Black Sea fleet direct access to the Mediterranean. That is the reason why Russia feels threatened. Putin is only protecting what Russia already rightfully owns.

Obama’s reaction with overt threats of war is unfathomable. Unless it is, the identical and irrational urge that compelled his warmongering in Syria. 

It is obvious that a war with Russia would be disastrous for the entire world. In addition, allowing Obama to send our troops into Russia could be dangerous here at home. Obama could use that as an excuse to declare martial law, suspend future elections and confiscate weapons. Obama could use a war with Russia to do what previous tyrants such as Mao and Pol Pot did and declare himself dictator for life.

Some think that it is far-fetched that Obama would launch a war with Russia just so he could suspend future elections and stay in office. The same people also did not believe that Obama was trying to push the US into the Syrian civil war.

Remember, the Washington Post and other presstitute media outlets are now calling for an end to presidential term limits. In 2012, Governor Bev Perdue (D-NC) called for a suspension of the elections to benefit Obama.

Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) addressed this concern in a committee meeting in December when he asked, ""If [Obama] can fail to enforce immigration laws, can he fail to enforce election laws?""
Moreover, if Russia stops using the US dollar in its international commercial transactions, including its gigantic sales of gas and petroleum, as it threatened to do yesterday, our US economy would plunge disastrously. Our markets would go into chaos, with unknowable and disastrous results.

This is the real reason why Obama wants to get the USA into a war with someone - anyone - whether it is Syria or Russia or even China.

Obama knows that during wartime, past presidents have abused their power and suspended the Constitution. He wants this excuse so that he can do the same, only ten times worse.
In Obama's mind, anything that weakens, threatens or endangers America, as a nation, will benefit Islam and his push for Sharia law. That is why Obama is willing to escalate a crisis in Ukraine even though it has nothing to do with America. 

This is exactly the reason he wanted to send American soldiers to Syria a few months ago - to overthrow the Assad regime with a Muslim Brotherhood regime. Just recall the $9 billion in cash aid he gave directly to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.

The government should be focused on fixing potholes, shoring up Social Security for our seniors and defending our shores from millions of illegal aliens coming here to take our jobs and birthright. Instead, Obama wants to get us into another war we cannot afford so that he can expand his own power.

Obama is exactly the type of tyrant that the Founding Fathers of America feared the most. The Founders understood that no President should be allowed to expand a standing army or war powers, because it would only lead to tyranny. They based this belief on Deuteronomy 17:16, ""He (the king) shall not multiply horses to himself.""

This is why, under our Constitution, the President is the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and Congress controls the purse strings for the military (Article 1, Section 8).
Obama, just as previous dictators have done, wants to send your sons and daughters off to die in unnecessary wars that have nothing to do with us.

He wants to steal your firearms, YOUR right to freedom of speech, and your right to religion - even putting home-schooling parents in jail!

War with Russia will accomplish nothing for you and your family, other than raising your taxes and possibly costing the lives of your family members. However, it will give Obama just the excuse he needs to suspend the Constitution.

This is the same nonsense that came from war-mongering Democrat politicians in the 1960s when troops were sent to Viet Nam to enter combat in that stupid war.

Fortunately, we still have some politicians left today with some common sense and we need to reach out to them right now. 

You can tell Congress to keep us out of war with Russia and warn others about Obama's latest attempt to push us into another war, by sending them the link below.

Libertarian,post,sales tax,e0j6jg,OGKebabEater,Come Join a Nation of Redditors," Hello all,

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan. 

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure
   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy (for now I will be the “king”)
      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building
      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services
      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port
      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing
      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island
      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location
   1. Set up the island as a luxury city 
      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island
      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven
      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island
      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure
   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to  jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself
   * 500,000
* The Port
   * 200,000 to build
      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry
      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings
   * 1,000,000
      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services
   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation
   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification
   * 50,000
* Food Supply
   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island 
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island
   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)
   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include
      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.
   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale
      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax
   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation
      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this
