IsraelPalestine,post,Israel,172w9gt,Buy_Ether,I have changed my mind about the Israel-Palestine conflict. Have you?,"For the past decade or so I have typically supported Palestine fighting for it's right to having a homeland. However, I just watched about 30 videos of events that took place today. What I saw was not people fighting for their homeland but people murdering, desecrating corpses innocent people. This is terrorism, plain and simple. In a couple instances it was Israeli soldiers which is at least not innocent civilians but the way they treated their bodies and paraded them and stomped on them is disgusting. I can now see why Israel needs to defend itself and it's people. I don't think they should be bombing equally innocent people on the Palestine side but I can see why they should defend themselves because the things I saw today we're revolting and horrific. I still think both sides should still strive to find peace but I am not sure if this is even possible after today's acts. Hamas likely will need to be eradicated and eliminated, vile people.

Has anyone else changed their mind, either way?",2023-10-08T10:51:36+00:00

IsraelPalestine,comment,Israel,k3z5yks,thesegoupto11,,"I was coming of age during the second intifada and learned about Israel and Palestine and became pro-Palestinian. Over the past several years I've been becoming more pro-Israel as I journied from conservative to liberal to socialist. Also prior to this I came out, so this has been a journey for sure.

It's incredibly naive to be LGBT and to support an ideology that would murder you the moment they had a chance. I believe the Star Wars effect play into this as well where there is this understanding that if you are a smaller resistance fighting against an empire then you are automatically the underdog and right by default.

I want peace. I want a two state solution. I want a free and secure Palestine alongside Israel. But if one side only sees peace as possible so long as the otherside is cleansed from the land... Ultimately what has happened over the past couple days is going to turn many middle of the road types more into the pro-Israel camp.",2023-10-08T11:44:32+00:00

IsraelPalestine,comment,Israel,k3zlo99,Stock_Butterscotch71,,"I changed my mind. I thought the IDF actually harmed Palestinians and I thought their last behavior was a human rights issue. But after seeing these animalistic Palestinian Muslim Jihadists Terrorist Hamas low lives murder, rape, and torture children, young girls, the elderly, they need to be wiped out. Any Jihadist extremism needs to be eliminated. And Israel needs to enforce stricter policies or a more effective occupation. This is absolutely one of the worst crimes against humanity cases in a developed country, aside from Ukraine. 
We see this conflict in Turkey/Kurds, Russia/Ukraine, USA/Native Americans, China/Taiwan-Uighur, Burma/Rohingya, Hutus/Tutsi. This is nothing new. An apartheid, a one or two state solution that is undeniably impossibly to uphold and implement. These acts of terror and crime are predominantly done by Jihadist Muslims, with the exception of Russia/Ukraine. No side is truly innocent. All sides have reacted in context of self defense. However, this needs to stop. Enough is enough. When will there be enough rape, murder, and corruption? If you support Hamas, you are a terrorist. You are Anti-Semitic. If you support Free Palestine through the persecution and murder of Jews, you are also a terrorist. Crimes against humanity should not take a side or be affiliated politically with one group of people who feel oppressed and need solidarity. Crimes against humanity are simply, crimes against humanity. No matter if you’re Palestinian MuslIm, Israeli Jew, Ukrainian, Russian, Chinese, Taiwanese, Burmese, Rohingya, etc. This is not right. We need to stop fighting against each other and leveling ourselves supports of Israel of Palestine. But right now, I support justice. And if Israel needs to defend her land from this terror attack and reclaim their citizens who are being held hostage, I support that because that is an act of justice. Also, the fact that the President of Palestine isn’t reprimanding those horrors tells me all I need to know. He condones evil and violence. Lastly, for those of who don’t know, there is a video on combat footage showing a Palestinian Jihadist father using his infant child as a shield as he yells at him and tells him to walk towards the Israeli soldiers and raise his Palestinian flag. This is evil. It is selfish. That is not justice. I hope you consider the weight of your opinion and outlook. If we keep diving Jews vs Muslim we will always be at war and face discrimination. We need to unite and agree that there are good and innocent Jews and Muslims who do not deserve this. We need to agree as separate groups of people that before we are Muslim, Jewish, Palestinian, Israeli, we are HUMAN. And as humans, let’s come together and support justice. Let’s not support the Hamas who parade miser and rape. Support the people who have been killed and those who have been abused by the Hamas.",2023-10-08T13:57:10+00:00

I was Pro-Palestinian, still kinda am because I think Israel should drive its settlers out of west bank and give more autonomy to West Bank and Gaza and make 2 state-solution. But after watching today's videos, i can't possibly deny that Hamas are fucking terrorists. They're taking young jewish girls as hostages, who have nothing to do with the politics. They're slaughtering any Israeli who comes their way, they are entering people's homes and killing them in their houses. They aren't sparing anyone-not the women or the children. They are parading dead bodies of Israelis. This is FUCKING DISGUSTING AND VILE. This is not resistance, this is terrorism..

But you know, what I found even more disgusting and horrifying than these graphic videos? I'm seeing stories of Arabs online, and they're PRAISING HAMAS, they're posting videos of houses and streets burning with Quranic verses playing in the background, they're praising their ""BROTHERS"" for their bravery. This is making a pit in my stomach.

Israel should have every right to occupy the entirety of the region, and enact a total police state. This would be to the benefit of the peaceful Palestinians too. It is clear that they cannot look after themselves, and they cannot manage to run anything, and just devolve into terrorism.

**Israel is a huge benefit to the global community.**

They are a prosperous nation, delivering technology and innovation to the benefit of the world. 

**The Palestinians offer nothing to the global community at all except endless pain, misery and destabilization.**

It's one thing to support Israel's right to defend themselves but it should not come at the expense of the lives of innocent Palestinian people either.

The outrage people are feeling for the innocent Israelis being raped and murdered is correct but equally so all the people going on about the lack of empathy,humanity etc the jihadis are showing should have the same energy for the innocent Palestinians who suffer daily too, including women and children ( who aren't going around raping and murdering and simply trying to survive).

Israel has a large and sophisticated military and and justifies their killing and land grab as part of their fight against terrorism, but make no mistake they have been killing Palestinians and taking their homes and lands since 1948. 
Palestinians, on the other hand, don't have the firepower to go against the Israeli military. Hence, they resolve to rerrorism. 

Neither side is innocent. they're killing civilians, and that has to stop. 

If you look at the Israelis, they're all white. Northern European White. Most of them, at least. 

All relocated from Europe after WWII. Europe didn't want the Jews so instead of ""expelling"" them, they created the state of Israel in Palestine under the pretext that this was their promised land. 

Simply, you have Jews relocating to Israel from all over the world as long as they're Jewish, they can be Israeli citizens. In 1922 there were less than 100,000 Jewish people living in Palestine.

Jews left the area 2500 years ago. 
While they do have a claim in the area, you can not ethnic cleans those who live in the area you're taking over.  

Palestinians, on the other hand, are natives of that land never moved away. 

This land grab has been going on for over 80 years. 
Give Palestine its statehood, and all these senseless wars will stop.
Both sides must coexist there's no power way. 

European powers and USA support Israel because they don't want the Jews in their countries. If they stop supporting Israel, Iran along with some Arab nations will push the Israelis out very quickly. In turn 6million Jews will be back in Europe and USA. And they simply don't want ray.

Absolutely, but that was always true, and the crimes being perpetrated now are no different than the ones that came before, just reversed and packed into a shorter time. Whether you believe it's morally right or wrong, what has been done to the Palestinians for years and decades is a far greater suffering than anything Hamas could ever inflict back in days or weeks, and I think it's important for people to understand that. This did not happen in a vacuum, this did not happen unprovoked, and despite how cruel and/or vicious it is, it's not a *disproportionate* response in its scale (like what tends to happen in the other direction, and likely will in this case too). I just hope this incident galvanises enough of the right people to bring them to the table and actually deliver positive, meaningful resolution to a conflict that has stagnated and become more hopeless than ever, but I'm not holding my breath. Far more likely is a continuation of the cycle of violence, oppression, and retribution that has persisted since the beginning.",2023-10-08T19:04:01+00:00

IsraelPalestine,post,Gaza,1blu3k4,Interesting_Run3136,Genocide in Gaza?,"I don't understand why people label it as genocide when ISRAEL is CLEARLY avoiding unnecessary civilian casualties

Compare it to the UK during WW2.
12,000 tons of explosive force dropped on them by Germans which resulted in 30,000 pure civilian deaths even though THEY HAVE BOMB SHELTERS. 

While in Gaza, the total tons of explosive force dropped on them is 70,000 tons from the 30,000 explosive weapons dropped resulting in 30,000 deaths.

-they have no bomb shelters at all even though the leader of hamas is a billionare

-their soldiers are dressed up as civilians and even counted as a civilian casualty

-6000 to 10,000 of those 30,000 deaths are hamas soldiers casualties

Achieving a 1:1 casualty ratio for civilian to bomb (1 bomb per 1 civilian) is a very hard MILITARY FEAT to achieve. There's almost no other military feat similar to this

Which is made more difficult because:

-Hamas are dressed up as civilians in their live battle footage in gaza

-THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SINGLE BOMB SHELTER IN GAZA.


So how are the casualties in Gaza who has no bomb shelters and more bombs dropped similar to the casualties of UK in WW2 who has less bombs dropped on them but similar casualties?

There's no GENOCIDE in GAZA period. Israel is not ""carpet bombing"". It's HAMAS who is committing intentional genocide and ethnic cleansing while Israel avoids unnecessary civilian casualties.

Compare it to Oct. 7 where Hamas intentionally fired upon civilians and committing massacres everywhere near the border. That is REAL GENOCIDE and ETHNIC CLEANSING.
They're even videotaping their massacres and parading the naked dead body of a German girl named Shani Louk.

The IDF asserted at about the same time that it had killed 9,000 Hamas fighters. Taking these numbers at face value, Israel’s response to Hamas has yielded roughly a 1.8:1 noncombatant-to-combatant fatality ratio. This rate is significantly lower than that of other asymmetric battles, such as the 2016 Battle of Mosul, in which Iraq and allied forces defeated the forces of the Islamic State. In fact, according to the UN, the average rate for wars is usually nine noncombatants killed for every one combatant. These facts speak to an ethical accomplishment: the fourth-side-open principle has saved many lives.

1 according to the Olso accord, Israel has control over area C, the area B and C should be gradually transfered to palestinian authority entirely, but the oslo accord is not complete, it's basically on hold because all the violence and other factors. So Israel still have control over area C, in which almost all it's settlements located.

2 according to the UN resolution  242 ,Israel should also retreat from the WB, but there is also a problem. According to 242, the surrounding Arab countries should recognize the legitimacy of the state of Israel.But that's not the case. The Arab countries haven't fulfill their obligation, so it's unfair to ask Israel to unilaterally fulfil the contract on its side. This makes the claim of Palestinians weak, and even weaker for the claim of Golan heights for Syrians.

So the Arab counties and Palestinians are actually feeding ammunitions for Israel to keep part of the WB. They are perfact proxy for all kinds of political agendas. If they all do their part and lay down their arms, Israel will face overwhelming international and domestic pressure.

That being said,I do hate the way IDF soldiers and the settlers treating Palestinians  at the WB  sometimes, many instances are far beyond security necessities and the govermant and the court should try harder to prevent it; and I do support the total withdraw from the WB for Israel if they can do it without causing harm to their own citizens, but in reality, the 'if' part has a big question mark on it.",2023-11-21T02:51:19+00:00

IsraelPalestine,comment,West Bank,ka1va57,Queasy_Ad_7297,,"In 1964, the Palestine Liberation Organization was established and wrote in its original charter that ""this Organization does not exercise any regional sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, on the Gaza Strip or the Himmah Area.""

In 1968, a year after Israel gained control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip following the Six Day War, they amended their charter to claim both the West Bank and Gaza as Palestinian lands.

""Syria Palestine"" was merely a geographic label. There was nothing exclusively Arab about it. It was a label of a land with no distinct political entity coined by Romans. 

In addition to being indigenous to the Land, as was recognized by the international community, Jews had also kept a continuous presence in the Land for thousands of years. Officially reclaiming the Land in 1948 from its final occupiers (the British) was an act of decolonization.

Occupation: Foreign control of an area that was under the previous sovereignty of another state.
This means State A had land. State B conquered A's land and is now occupying what was once State A-owned land.

**Keep in mind that you cannot occupy territories to which you have a sovereign claim to. In other words, you cannot occupy_your own land.**

What were Israel's borders when it declared independence? International law requires us to apply a universal rule called Uti Possidetis Juris.
Uti Possidetis Juris Principle: When a country is decolonized, its new borders will match the prior borders. This means Israel had sovereign claims to all of Jerusalem, Judea & Samaria, and Gaza because those were the previous borders according to the borders created by British Mandate of Palestine.

Upon declaring independence in 1948, Israel was invaded by 5 Arab countries set out with the intention to annihilate Israel. Jordan then illegally seized parts of Jerusalem and Judea & Samaria, and starved and ultimately expelled, ethnically cleansed, the entire Jewish population including Jews who had been living there for thousands of years (~100,000 people) However, under international law: a war of aggression cannot be used to change another country's borders. It was also universally agreed that Jordan did NOT have any legitimate claim of sovereignty.

For the first time in history, Palestinians were given the opportunity to self-govern in a territory that was never under their sovereignty to begin with.
The Palestinian Authority (PA) operates independently of Israel and governs the lives of Palestinians in Judea & Samaria. Unfortunately, Judea & Samaria is divided into Areas A, B, and C which was agreed upon by politicians on both sides.

-Area A is entirely controlled by the PA and Israeli Jews are forbidden from entering.
-Area B is mutually controlled (PA and Israeli security).
-Area C is entirely controlled by Israeli government, and both Israelis and Palestinians live in this area.

In any other situation of this happening, (Ukraine could be an example) land in Israel would be governed BY Israel and no one would bat an eye for this arrangement. Abbas clearly has got no control of the West Bank at this point (Israel’s enemies have enemies) and this “arrangement” rather than “distinct government recognized globally” gives Israel the right to say y’all can’t behave and can’t manage to not kill us or each other? We’ve gotta take over.” 

Personally, am I thrilled about how that’s working out? No. When individuals make choices that impact the whole, there are no winners. But they’re renters and if the owners want to sell, they want to sell.",2023-11-20T19:01:28+00:00

Hence, they weren’t “transferred” into “occupied territories”, but rather were born there. 

Finally, Israel isn’t the only country to establish settlements in “occupied territories”. Turkey in northern Cyprus, Turkey in Syria, Vietnam in Cambodia, Morocco in Western Sahara, ussr in the Baltic states, and Syria in Lebanon. All these had settlers in occupied territory.

Since the 2000s,  large Jewish real estate conglomerates have purchased residential land.  Their motivation is for religious purposes and to reclaim the holy lands.  I personally don't agree with it however technically it is not 'illegal' under the municipal law.  They are essentially purchasing or developing land and evicting the Palestinians who refuse to pay rent on the grounds of not recognising Israel.  

This is happening in the context of a larger geopolitical arena, that places west bank C between international law, and Israeli law. In other words the evictions are legal under Israeli law (which would be legal in other country) but illegal under international law of occupying forces.  

Also Israelis are arguing with the PA who make claims like October 7th was committed by the Jews, and that the holocaust didn't happen.  So you can see how more complex negotiations get flipped around when you're trying to deal with morons.",2023-11-20T19:28:29+00:00

But either way I think thats semantics and I'm pro-Israel, but think the settlements are the one true thing Israel is doing wrong as a matter of policy, because it's essentially an expansion of territory in a place that already has people living on it, and many of the settlers are batshit racists that have the mentality towards Arabs that Palestinians have towards Israelis which is pretty horrifying. And unlike Israelis in Israel proper, they have a home to go back to, so they really are colonists.

It is now clear to me that Israel does not have an honest partner for peace as the Palestinian leadership is completely corrupt and benefits from the status quo. Mahmoud Abbas is an antiemetic Holocaust denier morally bankrupt and corrupt politician (look up his dissertation at the University of Moscow- you can’t make this sh*t up) who pays terrorists who murder Israelis. Hamas, well you know who they are as puppets of Iran/Russia whose leaders are literally billionaires from stealing money from its poor population. Until the Palestinians have real non-Islamic Jihad terrorist (not an extreme thing to say- Yassir Arafat was one of the most brutal terrorists in modern history) leadership, which I believe will only happen after Israel makes peace with much of the Arab world (we are/were so close with Saudi Arabia, which was the most important pillar), then we shouldn’t even be discussing this. The Middle East only understands peace through strength, and this is what has gotten Israel this far. The strong Arab Countries will need to install an honest and educated non-extremist pro-western leader who will be able to actually recognize Israel’s right to exist, and turn off the unrealistic “right of return rhetoric” and actually have real conversations and be willing to accept (this word might be shocking and triggering to Palestinians) a compromise.

IsraelPalestine,post,Jerusalem,187fqed,Glittering-Pear-2470,Three murdered by Hamas terrorists in Jerusalem shooting attack,"Three people were killed and five other people were wounded in a shooting attack at the entrance to Jerusalem on Thursday morning, according to emergency services.

A 24-year-old woman, a 73-year-old man, and a woman in her 60s were killed in the attack, while three others were seriously wounded, and two others were in light to moderate condition.

The man murdered in the attack was named as Rabbi Elimelech Wasserman, who served as a rabbinical judge in the rabbinical court in Ashdod, according to Religious Services Minister Michael Malchieli. One of the women murdered in the attack was named as Chana Ifergan, the principal of Beis Yaakov Bnot Hadassah in Beit Shemesh. Livia Dickman, a resident of Har Nof, was named as the third victim.

According to police, two terrorists from east Jerusalem carrying an M16 and a handgun arrived at the Givat Shaul junction near the entrance to Jerusalem on Thursday morning and began firing at civilians at a nearby bus stop.

They would forget quickly of course, but it brought calm for the moment. Eventually enough reprisal and the whole population will flee.

Now everything is surgical, very precise and far less honest. This insults the dignity of the Arab heart, they want old fashioned consequence that is easy to understand. Before Oct. 7th, people were getting picked off at every chance by shooters, stabbing and car attacks. The police/idf would go arrest the suspects, or even kill ""militants"". But there was no JUSTICE.

In the 1950's Israel was very weak and still managed to control the borders by lashing out with VENGEANCE that everyone could easily understand. It must send a clear moral lesson that every twerk on social media can understand, actions have consequence. Right now most people are too stupid to see how things link together, they are are only getting the isolated symptom which brings wailing and hostile, delusional propaganda.

The nation just sat there until Oct 7th and watched their people get killed left and right, with no consequence to the other side.

Every last one of them is accounted for, or damn near. 

It’s such a drastic difference from the media coverage on the swathes of Palestinians who are suffering, displaced, dying, and already dead in Gaza. Almost everything I see about Palestinians is generalized & collective. It’s a lot easier to dehumanize victims who have no one telling their individual accounts.

My thoughts (preface I’m still working through this so I might mis-type) - I feel as though when I look at Israeli injustice, it’s doesn’t land the same way because of intentionality.

Israel did not build the separation barriers and blockade for no reason, they did so in reaction to fatah and hamas violence respectively. Therefore when I see Palestinians being harmed I know intellectually it is wrong and disproportionate, but my subconscious goes “well, it’s happening due to Israel’s overreaction, not because Israel wants to harm the Palestinians in question”

When I see hamas fighters gang raping, kidnapping, mass executioning etc, the intention IS to harm civilians. Therefore there is a more visceral response. Even though Palestinians have objectively had it worse.

IsraelPalestine,post,War,1b0r9vv,American-Dreaming,"No, Winning a War Isn't ""Genocide""","In the months since the October 7th Hamas attacks, Israel’s military actions in the ensuing war have been increasingly denounced as “genocide.” This article challenges that characterization, delving into the definition and history of the concept of genocide, as well as opinion polling, the latest stats and figures, the facts and dynamics of the Israel-Hamas war, comparisons to other conflicts, and geopolitical analysis. 

One of the most striking aspects of the politics surrounding this issue is encapsulated in this quote:“‘Genocide’ was coined during the Holocaust as a way to distinguish crimes of such unimaginable magnitude from other kinds of atrocities. The sad irony is that while two-thirds of young adults think Israel is guilty of genocide, a December, 2023 poll found that 20 percent of this same cohort thinks the Holocaust is a myth, and 30 percent aren’t sure. That’s right, most young people believe Israel is committing genocide, and half also agree or ‘neither agree nor disagree’ that the event which inspired the creation of the term — and perhaps the most clear-cut example of genocide in all of human history — is a myth. The double standard imposed on Jews may never be more neatly expressed in numbers.”

Also: “To put things in context, in World War II, allied bombing in populated areas ahead of the Battle of Normandy killed about 20,000 French civilians. More recently, as Posen notes, the 2016–2017 US-led campaigns to destroy the Islamic State in Mosul, Iraq and Raqqa, Syria — two cities that had a combined estimated population of 1.8 million — killed between 13,100 and 15,100 civilians. Gaza, by contrast, has an approximate population of 2.2 million.”

It was a reasonable decision, but the word choice makes it possible to structure a genocide argument even when there is no mass democide (intentional killings of civilians). This is problematic because the popular conception of genocide *is* democide at a massive scale.

 This allows for plausible legal genocide claims against many military campaigns in urban areas. It also allows indiscriminate killings of innocents in a legitimate war to be conflated with organized extermination of a group.

So that's either 1/6 or 1/3 of the 30000.

When you consider you have a military force wearing civilian clothing,  hiding amongst the civilian populace using them as human shields, it's difficult to see what Israel could be doing differently by in large.

But as Hamas is going up against a stronger more well equipped force, can really blame them for their cowardly tactics?

What are their options?

\- Surrender?

\- Fight a conventional war and get slaughtered?

\- Or continue to put their civilian population in harms way?

Since the majority of the civilian population still support Hamas and share the desire to destroy the State of Israel, they don't push for surrender and they continue to allow these cowardly tactics to continue.

But then can you really expect anything more from civilian population who have been oppressed by the IDF all these years and indoctrinated into the Hamas terrorist culture?

The blame is on BOTH sides and anyone naive enough to call this a genocide really needs to look past their own bias, and ask the question, what can BOTH sides be doing differently to prevent civilian casualties?

1. Ukraines civilian death toll is around 10, 000 thus it is difficult for me to believe that the civilian casualties rate is so high. Russia has been invading Ukraine for 2 years and Isreal has killed 3x the civilians. Let alone with the incoming Rafah assault, these numbers seem far to high
2. If you look at the Hamas attack they too had around 60-70% civilian casualty rate. Hamas is a terrorist group that took a bunch of meth and hacked up everyone they could see with machetes, and they got a similar kill ratio as Isreal. I’m sorry but theirs not much difference for the victim just because Israeli soldiers are sending drones to blow up people. My distaste for Hamas and the Oct 7 accounts are exactly what makes me think Israel is acting horribly
3. Israel has committed several war crimes including bombing hospitals schools mosques and everything. It’s hard to take them at faith every time that they are military installations when mass civilians die. They are taking steps like leaflets and warnings but it’s not enough. The over ambition on targets has far out paced Israel’s ability to move refugees and warn civilians. Several refugee camps and caravans as well hit.

Israel is not committing genocide, but this war is absolutely not moral. Israel is conducting itself like a dictatorship right now, firing with impunity like Russia. I don’t think it’s too much to ask for Israel to uphold international norms and standards. Hamas, Iran, Hezbollah certainly don’t, but they also aren’t funded by the west, or are “bastions” of democracy.

One of the reasons you give as to why this isn’t a genocide, is because people deny the holocaust. Two completely unrelated points. “You know why this isn’t genocide?!

First of all, palestinians are the indigenous people of palestine. The father of judaism fled to palestine (named canaan at the time), he was of iraqui origins. Palestinians have 99% resemblance to canaanite dna unlike your average jewish ukranian settler in israel. 

Second thing, since 1948, multiple genocides were committed against the palestinians people, let’s look at the definition of genocide, or its requirements rather. 

1st requirement: proven intent to physically destroy a nation. 
I don’t need to share videos because we have all seen the videos of soldiers saying “we should flatten gaza” “no baby is innocent” “i was looking for a baby” “turn gaza into a parking lot” “ we should fight the amalek” “there will be no one alive in gaza” … these claims made by squatters and idf murderers as well show clearly the intent to destroy gaza and gazans. 

2nd requirement: the physical element, which is widely proven by seeing the different videos and pics of children shredded, even getting shot (for everyone saying israel doesn’t target civilians). Even in the west bank where there is no hamas people die everyday. 

The ICJ has determined it is genocide. You bringing up the holocaust WHICH PALESTINIANS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH is stupid and foolish. 

Another point, there is no war, a war would require a country to have military, which hamas barely has. Also i have never seen an alleged victim (israel which it isn’t) bomb four different countries and starve its oppressors (gaza like they try to claim).

*it seriously disturbs me how people can still argue that whatever is going on in gaza and the west bank for that matter is disgusting and needs to stop. It shocks me that people support the europeans that go to palestine claiming they are indigenous while killing the actual indigenous people of that land. It kills me seeing children dying because some fool decided he had more right to palestine than the actual palestinians who have lived there since day one along with the last 10 generations of their own or even more.

IsraelPalestine,comment,Ceasefire,ksymie9,-----9-----,,"It depends on what type of ceasefire is negotiated. 

Hamas' proposal was a phased, 135 day ceasefire during which negotiations would be held to reach a permanent ceasefire... the Israeli hostages would be released in 3 phases, in exchange for Palestinian ""prisoners"" held without trial by Israel. Hamas wants a permanent ceasefire, Israel merely wants a temporary one to get its hostages back (then it can act even more unrestrained than already).

Over the next days/months, hostages would be exchanged and Israeli forces would withdraw. Negotiations would continue toward resolving the conflict permanently. That's another reason Israel wants a temporary ceasefire: they want to keep the threat of war in order to force more concessions on the permanent resolution of the conflict.

""Are their leaders suppose to give themselves up for punishment over what happened 7th of October last year?"" 

...First of all, many of those killed on Oct 7 were in fact shot by the lDF... it's been well established. They shot cars with hostages as they were driving back to gaza, and unleashed indiscriminate fire on the music festival. Part of the (supposedly discontinued) Hannibal directive. But the evidence is clear, although undoubtedly Palestinians committed terrible atrocities. Regarding Hamas' leaders, probably not? depends on what could be negotiated. But will any members of the Israeli government face prosecution for slaughtering thousands, including some of their own citizens? 

Hamas always breaks the ""ceasefire"" because Gaza has been under siege since the 2000s. The UN recognizes that Israel has always been the occupying authority since their ""withdrawal"" since they control the flow of food and aid into gaza. As well as controlling airspace, marine territory, etc.  ... Israel has been slowly turning Gaza into a giant prison for years now, so people there can be expected to lash out periodically from time to time. This suits Israel fine as it gives them an excuse to continue their occupation, in Gaza and the WB too.

IsraelPalestine,comment,Peace process,hg7hyj3,Kumbaya126,,"Seeing that the debate was sparked successfully, I reckon I should also say my opinion regarding the anti-normalization stance.

As an Israeli, it's important to look back at history and understand the mistakes we made along the way. I usually tend to criticize the Israeli government however for now I will give them credit points: Throughout the history of the conflict they changed and adapted to the situation - some governments were vastly leftist while others were more right wing, however considering that the fact that the Palestinian leadership from day one until today is still harboring the same old anti-normalization stance and even forcing it on other countries, it's pretty clear on why the Palestinian suffering is still rampant and their struggle to independence is failing.

Anti normalization does not lead to peace. It will not force Israel to change its stance as it's proven that Israel can still strive despite some Arab countries boycotting it and BDS attempting to economically sanction its goods and products. There is nothing more absurd than thinking that anti-normalization will lead the Israeli government to change its ways - Today Israeli society is way more nationalistic and less leftist than they were before the early 2000s, as someone here already said it - ""The second Intifada killed the Israeli left""

In my honest opinion, anti-normalization proved itself not to work and those who promote it are doing a terrible mistake - the Palestinians will never overpower the Israelis and at the same time they do not have any bargaining chip against them. At this point it's almost impossible for the two nations to co-exist with each due to their severe hatred of each other, as Israelis are starting to adapt the same anti-normalization stance against the Palestinians.",2021-10-11T08:44:19+00:00
IsraelPalestine,comment,Peace process,hg7olep,WeirdSpaceCommunist,,">Decades later, we can still see a considerable amount of anti-normalizers.

Bahrain, Oman, Morocco and more, are growing disillusioned and distrustful of the Palestinians. I remember back in 2019-2020 i think, there were two shows, one in KSA and the other in Kuwait (i think), talking about either the Jewish communities that were once in those countries, or about the Palestinians.

In one of those shows, there was a part where two men are talking about the Palestinians. they discuss it at length, when one of them says something along the line of ""we gave them money for decades. we supported them for decades. we gave their movement (Islamic Brotherhood) shelter in our country. and how do they repay us? they call for the destruction of our country and monarchy"".

There are a lot of voices asking a simple question: why do the Palestinians get to recognize Israel's right to exist (the Oslo Accords), but the countries that signed the Abraham Accords can't?

Normalization, since the second intifada has always been a carrot for Israel to stop the occupation in exchange for trade relations. Normalization removes the carrot, and allows Israel to move on indefinitely with the occupation at no cost. 

Now, of course, I believe that the Palestinians should lean more towards the stick and make the occupation actually cost Israel in terms of definite losses, not just the loss of potential trade or cultural relations. We’ve seen from the past thirty or so years since the PLO lost Soviet support and they dedicated themselves to peaceful resistance that begging without any negotiating power accomplishes nothing. In this case, normalization is actually detrimental to the Palestinian cause for the reasons stated above. 

I am also of the opinion for Palestine in particular, that Palestine should have no economic or cultural relations with Israel. It is impossible for there to be any equality between the two parties with one being so much economically superior, so Palestine should simply not allow themselves to be exploited. This obviously means that Palestinians should be anti normalization to emphasize the differences between Israelis and Palestinians and encourage separation (and independence as a result).",2021-10-10T23:30:07+00:00

Before you criticize Israel, ask these questions to yourself,

1) Hamas initiated the attack. 
2) they didn’t attack the army but the civilians of Israel. 
3) they raped women, beheaded babies and killed “civilians” brutally. 
4) they hide behind their own civilians so that they can raise issues like this. 
5) they make the operational bases under hospitals and civilian homes. 
6) they tell the whole world that we are not responsible to protect our own civilians, it’s Israel’s responsibility, even though we killed their civilians and hide behind ours. 
7) all the Muslim nations condemning Israel’s self defence but not condemning Hamas attack on Israeli civilians. 
8) why Muslim nations are not taking their Palestinian brothers and sisters as refugees in their own nations?
9) instead of condemning Hamas aggression, why are they not trying to tell Hamas to release the hostages and stop their aggression?
10) why is Hamas using the aid for Palestinian people for their own terrorists?
11) why are the Muslims around the globe protesting against Israel self defence but they were quite when Hamas murdered Israeli civilians? 
12) why Hamas leader broadcasted a meeting in a south Indian state where he said “bulldoze hidutava and all the Hindus? Why Muslims nations are not condemning the spread of religious hatred by Hamas?
13) what would have you done if Hamas or any other terrorist organisation did this to your own countrymen and to your own sisters, brothers, father and mother?",2023-11-02T13:26:57+00:00

I think some of your conclusions are rushed or need elaboration:
8 - they fear that there’ll be a missed step later where those refugees can’t go home. Their stance is on Palestinian’s right to exist and to their homes (not Hamas but the civilians)
10 - currently there’s not really aid to steal (this one is likely partly propped by propaganda saying we shouldn’t send aid as Hamas will steal it all - we should still send aid).
11 - they weren’t quiet but you can’t really protest the past, you protest the current. We mourn and join the vigils to show solidarity after a horrific loss of life. Soon after that loss of life war began. If Israel wasn’t bombing right now, there’d definitely be more outcry against Hamas with even more protests focused on the hostages and bringing the perpetrators of those horrific acts to justice.

3) I think some of this is disputed, but yes, all killing of civillians is 100% wriong and I've no doubt awful crimes occured.

IsraelPalestine,comment,Hamas,k7kb85s,Then-Ad8034,,"This is an answer to your question please note that this doesn’t reflect my views, this is just an answer 
1. The attack was initiated by by Israel when they started the occupation.

2. They entered an area that is usually heavily manned and protected (makes you wonder why it wasn’t that day…)

3. Rape and beheaded babies has yet to be proven by a primary source. However what has been proven is that once the IDF forces came (after 6hours) they started firing openly shooting hostages.

4. They don’t really have much place to move around and relocate…

5. I’ll give you this one BUT!!! Do you really think that ALL the locations bombed up until now were justifiable target? It’s highly improbable.

6. Hamas isn’t really telling the world much. It’s just people who have morals and respect human life that are going out and marching for peace and freedom.

7. You do realise Israel has committed multiple crimes against war in what they are going to the people of Gaza and the West Bank… everyone is condemning Israel except for the US Canada UK and just a couple more. 

8. Because if the Palestinians leave their land they will never be able to come back PLUS the rafah borders between Egypt and Palestine is controlled by Israel and they’re barely letting anything get through. 

9. Hamas offered to release Nourit Yitshaq and Yokhefed Lifshitz with Qatar as a mediator (as was done with the release of the other hostages) but for some reason Israel declined. 

10. What type of aid? Food, water, medical supplies. This is also a point that can’t really be proven. Btw there’s no hamas in the West Bank 

11. Because Muslims have been following this war for a long time so October 7th although it was horrible, wasn’t really that “crazy” because it barely makes a dent in the total civilian deaths the Palestinians have experienced over the years.

12. Because there is an actual genocide going on right now, so it’s really not the time to be expected sympathy for a comment made by a heated politician. 

13. I would honestly, first of all question why our kibbutz wasn’t properly protected and why it took IDF soldiers 6 hours to arrive, then maybe I would have saw it coming with me being a coloniser who is actively stealing land and living in stolen land.",2023-11-02T21:24:15+00:00

**BBC:**  
Israel's Netanyahu says defences are 'ready' as Iran attacks  
  
  
Iran has launched aerial drones at Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says, appearing to mark a widely anticipated reprisal attack.  
  
Israel's Channel 12 TV says the salvo is expected to reach Israel at around 02:00 on Sunday (00:00 GMT).  
  
It said Israeli forces were on high alert and ""monitoring all targets"".  
  
Iran had vowed to retaliate for an attack on its consulate in Syria on 1 April which killed seven military officers, including a top commander.  
  
It accused Israel of carrying out that attack. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied it.  
  
Shortly before news of Iran's drone launch, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country's ""defensive systems"" were deployed.  
  
""We are ready for any scenario, both defensively and offensively. The State of Israel is strong. The IDF is strong. The public is strong.  
  
""We appreciate the US standing alongside Israel, as well as the support of Britain, France and many other countries.""

It's definitely not the end; there will be Israel's response, and likely Iran's response to that.

Previously they were quite influential and had major roles to play  
Why is that ? Do they still exist ? Have they a role to play? Is there positions not being reported on ? Have they lost influence and power ?  
interested observer trying to get the full picture on the dynamics that exist in the region ,  
any links / opinions that help explain their role would be appreciated

&#x200B;

my knowledge of Fatah/PLO is summarised below

Fatah

A militant Palestinian organization. It was founded (1962) in Kuwait to fight for the restoration of Palestine to the Arabs. Al-Fatah assumed the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1969 and remained the dominant group within the PLO. Its guerrilla units were expelled from Jordan after the civil war in 1970, and it withdrew to southern Lebanon (Fatahland). Subsequently al-Fatah was drawn into the Lebanese imbroglio and became divided; a part was expelled from Lebanon after the Israeli invasion of 1982. Leadership remained in the hands of Yasser Arafat, who had led al-Fatah from its foundation. Al-Fatah played a leading role in the achievement of the 1993 peace agreement with Israel. However, divisions within the organization over the progress of PLO–Israeli negotiations became apparent in 1995 with some factions no longer remaining loyal to Arafat. Al-Fatah won the first legislative elections for the Palestinian National Authority in 1996 and retained power until defeated by Hamas in 2006.

PLO

A political and military body formed in 1964 to unite various Palestinian Arab groups in opposition to the Israeli presence in the former territory of Palestine. From 1967 the organization was dominated by al-Fatah, led by Yasser Arafat. The activities of its radical factions caused trouble with the host country, Jordan, and, following a brief civil war in 1970, it moved to Lebanon and Syria. In 1974 the organization was recognized by the Arab nations as the representative of all Palestinians. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon (1982) undermined its military power and organization, and it regrouped in Tunisia. Splinter groups of extremists, such as the ‘Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine’ and the ‘Black September’ terrorists, have been responsible for kidnappings, hijackings, and killings both in and beyond the Middle East. In 1988 Arafat persuaded the movement to renounce violence, and its governing council recognized the State of Israel. Thereafter the PLO was accepted by an increasing number of states as being a government-in-exile. In 1993 Arafat became chair of the Palestinian National Authority, which administered the West Bank and the Gaza Strip from 1995. The PLO continued to be responsible for negotiations with Israel, but these broke down in 2000. In 2004 Mahmoud Abbas became leader of the PLO following Arafat's death.",2024-02-07T12:25:17+00:00
IsraelPalestine,comment,PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization),kpbnlnx,knign,,"Ever since Oslo and especially since the Hamas takeover of Gaza, PLO and Fatah are effectively integral parts of Palestinian National Authority (PNA) under 88 years old Abbas.

PNA official position on the conflict is pretty much what you'd expect. Condemning Israel, condemning ""occupation"", condemning ""genocide"", keeping silent on Hamas. They envision a post-war scenario of some unified government with Hamas (so Hamas still ruling Gaza, but now officially as part of PNA). 

In the meantime, they are losing control over northern WB and everyone is getting ready for post-Abbas power struggle, so their influence on the conflict and future of Gaza isn't great.",2024-02-07T12:47:27+00:00
IsraelPalestine,comment,PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization),kpbvbvw,-Original_Name-,,"they're pro corruption and are trying to appease everyone while also angering everyone.
They're the government of the Palestinian authority, basically select urban enclaves where most non Gazan palestinians live, as agreed upon in the oslo accords.

Heard they're pretty unpopular and seen as Israel's sheep by the Palestinians, but on the other hand they're seen as a sponsor of terror by the Israelis through their pay for slay system.

Both them and Hamas have suspended elections after the Hamas vs Fatah war in 2007(I think, mightve started earlier).",2024-02-07T13:47:35+00:00

Fatah loyalists in Gaza are openly critical of Hamas. 

None of the organizations have the legitimacy to properly run a Palestinian state. it's a big problem for the two state dream.",2024-02-07T15:41:41+00:00
IsraelPalestine,comment,PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization),kpc8u6l,ThirstyTarantulas,,"The PLO is the only legal and official representative of the Palestinian people internationally and is the closest thing to an ""official Palestinian government"" that people can meet with or do deals with. Technically it's the PLO sitting as a non-member state at the UN for example.

There's a Letter of Mutual Recognition between Israel and PLO on 9 September 1993, so the official representation of both technically recognize each other

&#x200B;

The PLO has many members and sub-parties, Fatah being the biggest one:

Fatah is a political party, similar to the Likud or Yesh Atid or something similar in Israel

The PLO also has some one-state factions, similar to how Ben Gvir and Smotrich are Israeli one-staters. Whether Hamas or Hamas affiliates should stay in the PLO or be kicked out is something the Palestinians and PLO are currently debating, similar to the debate on whether Kahanists who support terrorism should stay in the Knesset.

&#x200B;

The background of both Fatah and PLO is more militant, in the same way that the Likud's background is Herut (Revisionist Zionism) whose background was Irgun, a militant group that was once recognized and described as a terrorist organization by the UK and the US governments in the 1940s but has since become more professional and spawned things like the Likud and the IDF. To be academically honest, there are some primarily Israeli sources who claim these groups were not militant and they really tried super hard to not kill civilians.",2024-02-07T15:17:29+00:00

&#x200B;

>Yadlin said Israel would be ""happy"" if Hamas took over Gaza  because the IDF could then deal with Gaza as a hostile state.

&#x200B;

>Palestinian President Mahmoud  Abbas and Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh had become  personally close despite their ideological differences, but  neither leader had control over those forces under them.

&#x200B;

>The Hamas military wing had been frustrated  since the signing of the Mecca Agreement in January, but  there were also many armed groups in Gaza that were not under  the control of either party.  Yadlin cited the example of the  Dughmush clan, which had shifted from Fatah to the Popular  Resistance Committees to Hamas before becoming an armed  entity opposed to all of them.

&#x200B;

>""\[Fatah\] are approaching a zero-sum situation, and yet  they ask us to attack Hamas.  This is a new development.  We  have never seen this before.  They are desperate.""  

&#x200B;

>Abbas is  already talking about how he plans to retire from the  political scene after his term ends in 2008.  He knows he is  weak and that he has failed.  He has failed to rehabilitate Fatah.

IsraelPalestine,comment,PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization),kpcpc3l,ThirstyTarantulas,,"PFLP is the second largest party after Fatah. That doesn't mean they're super popular. They got \~4% of the total vote in the last elections (though those were almost 20 years ago), though in some areas they got \~5-10%. Their leader is in Israeli jail for another decade or so.

They were both militant back in the day, but Fatah in the 90s started becoming more moderate and accepted two states and worked towards it. PFLP were very very very communist, defined themselves as such, Marxist-Leninst, very Che Guevara-esque, especially in the 60s when they were created after two similar groups merged. They have at various points removed themselves from the PLO in protest, like when Oslo happened, but they keep coming back because in the end the PLO is the only sole official representation of the Palestinians. They're one-staters.

The Palestinians are diverse & divided ideologically, same as the Israelis. They reject two states like the Likud or Otzma Yehudit or Yamina etc do. Just like some parties are problematic and an issue in the Knesset, so too are certain parties or factions in the PLO. 

Both Fatah and much more the PA are today very corrupt though, so that takes away their effectiveness despite on paper them being pro-peace, pro-two-states, etc. (But then again I can draw a certain parallel to a certain corrupt cigar loving Prime Minister if I want...but to be very fair, the corruption of Bibi doesn't come close to matching the disgusting cancerous corruption of Fatah today).",2024-02-07T16:53:09+00:00

On the killing of civilians, all of the Irgun, Lehi, Hamas, PIJ, etc would strongly argue they do not *intentionally* kill civilians and their mandates promote that!

There are a lot of caveats. For example, Hamas believes anyone who serves (or in some cases anyone who *has* served) in the IDF is not a civilian, so given how every Israeli is drafted, that's obviously problematic.

With respect to Jewish militants, read up on the King David Hotel Bombing. \~90 people, including innocent Jews and Arabs, were killed and the Irgun (with approval from the Haganah) basically bombed it to destroy evidence of previous militant/terroristic activities against the Brits. Bibi on the 60th anniversary of the bombing praised it, saying the hotel was a legitimate military target and they didn't *mean* to kill civilians.",2024-02-07T20:11:53+00:00

I would add however that it’s a complex issue that deals with unclear international law and sovereignty on the one hand, and also freedom of movement on the other.

Essentially, the settlements violate the Geneva convention to the extent they represent the state of Israel transferring its civilian population on to Palestinian land. I’m not an expert on it, but it’s my understanding that a vast majority, but perhaps not all, of the settlements and settlers receive support from the Israeli government or influential Israeli groups in one way or another, directly or indirectly, and may therefore fall under varying determinations of illegality. 

I think many Israelis and jews in my experience, though I couldn’t say how many, recognize that the settlements are an impediment to peace.

IsraelPalestine,comment,Settlements,ka29cdb,Lopsided_Thing_9474,,"Yeah. We can agree. 

It’s complicated though-  

So … in 1948 when the UN brought prop 181 to vote - which was a two state partition plan- the borders were created by the land that was owned by the Jews - 

It passed - the UN passed the vote , Israel was going to be official. 

What happened is *days later* literally ; the Palestinians and every single Arab country declares war on the Jews - and they make it very clear they will resort to violence to prevent the creation of Israel. 
( this is also why the Jews had no choice. They knew better than anyone that no Arab country would ever let them have their land back. .. and never will. They intentionally sabotaged them.  To make them look bad. To say they’re occupied etc etc) 

Because they declared war- Prop 181 was retracted officially. Both sides had to accept it- and at the very least not declare an international war on Jews for it to be official. 

The Jews you have to understand at this point; they’re coming off the worst event in human history towards any people- the Holocaust , but also- violent attacks, ethnic cleansing of Jews , Jews were being evicted from countries - everywhere. Not just Germany. America was the only safe place for them in the world. So everyone , agreed - that the Jews needed their homeland back and this had been going on for a while- way before WW2… the idea of Israel… 

So this is why- the Palestinians say they’re “occupied”… because technically - the entire state of Israel is not approved of - although it was-  but technically the Arabs were never going to let them have it. 

International law states that to create a country, you must define your borders, create an educational system, legal system and defend your borders with your own system of - military or police force - etc etc - so that’s exactly what the Jews did. 

So even though they aren’t approved of ( but it was ) they went ahead and established their own country .. legally - but to Arabs and Palestinians - it’s illegally. 

Because they don’t want them to have *any land at all*..

This is why you see old Jewish men say - we took this country by force! 

Because they did. They fought against all those Arab nations and won- which at the time- no one , and esp the Arabs didn’t think they would win. The Arabs had zero problems wiping the Jews off the face of the map. 

They just didn’t count on the Jews winning the wars. And also- being so fucking amazing that they went ahead and created their own country from the ground up.

This law was drafted in response to WWII where Germany transferred German citizens to occupied territories and forced the occupied peoples like the Poles out of Poland.

The fact of the matter is that Israel nominally accepts that the West Bank is a territory which it is obligated to run according to the laws of belligerent occupation. These laws, in turn, are governed by the terms established by treaties, such as the Geneva Conventions, that Israel is a signatory to. 

In 1967, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol received a memo from his international law advisor, Theodor Meron, saying that [settling the occupied territories in his opinion violates the Geneva Convention](https://www.thejc.com/comment/analysis/britain-honours-israeli-judge-who-warned-against-settlements-1.496657).

IsraelPalestine,post,Annexation,t04iuq,Peltuose,Total annexation is not peace,"Far too often, people on both sides of this conflict seem to think that annexing ""the other side"" (i.e Israel annexing the Palestinian territories, Palestinians annexing Israel) is some form of a peace treaty/final solution as it will put the stronger of the two in full power, and that there wouldn't even be an ""other side"" to be at conflict with. There are three main problems with this argument:

* Integration: Integrating the large number of Jews or Arabs in either regions is impossible, due to demographics changes and general cultural differences, annexation from either side will result in a massive integration problem.
* Resistance: Neither side will just be pushed around by the other side, annexing/taking over lands in either Israel or Palestine will result in some form of resistance, one way or the other. It is pretty much impossible for say, the IDF to have absolute power over all Palestinians, and vice versa.
* Human rights: This is perhaps the most important of all,  annexation would result in human rights violations. Not only would annexation have to likely include unjust violence against the natives of the region, but it would be a clear violation of international law. International law and the overwhelming majority of the international community support Israel in Israel proper and Palestine in the Palestinian territories, anything else is going directly against the clear set of values we've learned to take on post-WW2 to avoid further unneeded bloodshed.

Some people call this the ""all-or-nothing"" approach, and this approach is highly unrealistic, Kahanists and Hamas supporters both share this non-compromising approach, and as we know these people are the pinnacle of non-peacefulness. The total annexation of another region can, at best, be considered ""winning"" the conflict, not securing peace. Annexation from either side will likely not result in a happy one state with equal rights for all, but it would most likely result in an apartheid military/police state built on oppression, whether either side likes it or not.

What I'm saying generally boils down to: Annexations are a net-negative for everybody involved, they are a violation of human rights, land rights and almost everything in between, and that these plans are highly unrealistic to:A) ever even happenB) ever even happen successfully/in the way intended.

I think we as Israelis, Palestinians etc. should start focusing on securing real peace, a form of peace that will satisfy both sides, and a form of peace that isn't built on pushing around either side just because they can. I'm not asking Israel and Palestine to be lovey-dovey allies, but securing a clear peace deal to ensure Palestinians have a state and that both of our borders are clear is the bare minimum I'm expecting of Israeli and Palestinian leaders.",2022-02-24T06:58:42+00:00

IsraelPalestine,comment,Occupation,kaubfi8,the_leviathan711,,"Two points of factual correction:

> Yet, the Palestinian Authority, not Israel, that occupies 98% of the Palestinian Arabs

I'm entirely unclear as to how you arrived at this number of ""98%"" of Palestinian Arabs are ""governed"" by the Palestinian Authority. There's not really any definition of ""Palestinian"" or ""governed"" for which this is actually true - even if I'm being extremely generous. 

Only 55% of West Bank Palestinians live in ""Area A"" - the part of the West Bank where ""the streets of their cities are policed by the Palestinian security forces."" Another 40% live in ""Area B"" - where the PA has some governing power, but security work is held by IDF. So even with that extremely generous definition of ""governing"" (more on this in a moment) - you still only end up with 95% (not 98%) of *West Bank* Palestinians who you could say are ""governed"" in some way by the PA. 

And of course, West Bank Palestinians are only a proportion of Palestinians. Palestinians in East Jerusalem (some 400,000 people) aren't under the control of the Palestinian Authority in the slightest. Nor are Palestinians in Gaza, nor are Palestinians with Israeli citizenship.

> Pretty much the only thing the Palestinian Authority can’t do is import tanks, planes, Iranian “volunteers,” or North Korean missiles.

So this isn't true either. The Palestinian Authority is not a sovereign entity - it has some autonomy to be sure, but it is ultimately under the sovereignty of the Israeli state. And the limitations of that are far beyond the ability to import and export weaponry. Israel controls all borders in and out of the West Bank and therefore controls all trade. Israel controls all non-urbanized public land, Israel controls the airspace, Israel controls the electromagentic spectrum (meaning all telecomunnications), Israel even controls the Palestinian population registry. And possibly most significantly: Israel controls all the roads *between* cities and towns.

What this last point means is that a Palestinian who lives in Bethlehem (in Area A) who needs to travel to Hebron (also in Area A) for work on a daily basis must pass through areas under the control of the Israeli military. What that means is that the road might be closed to Palestinian traffic at any time for any reason - and this Palestinian commuter might be stuck in Bethlehem or in Hebron, unable to reach her work or home. It's not uncommon for these sorts of closures to happen on Jewish holidays.

All that is to say, even for most Palestinians who live in ""Area A"" (just 55% of West Bank Palestinians), the PA has less of an impact on their actual lives and less governing power than the IDF does.

We could probably argue endlessly about whether this situation is *justified* or not. I'd argue it absolutely is not and I'm sure you would argue that it is. This is not my point though - my point is only to offer a factual correction to the initial claim that 98% of Palestinians are governed by the PA. This is simply untrue.",2023-11-26T15:15:01+00:00

They raped women.
The shot babies in the head, not as collateral damage but there's intentional terror.
They be-headed people, including a man who lay there on the ground dying from gunshot wounds as they used a garden hoe to remove his head.

Despite the claims that these are made up, I've seen the videos that Hamas members posted to their own social media.

If you can't see Hamas has a completely evil entity, then we don't share a moral code.

We can talk about things that IDF have done all day long and I can criticize those things as well,

But if you don't see rape, torture, executing babies at point blank range, and beheading people with garden tools for effect as the actions of a completely evil entity, then despite the civil conversation, we're not starting from the same set of moral beliefs and values. One side is playing rugby and the other side is playing football and there's no agreement about what's moral and what isn't.

Raping women because you're mad about the way you're being treated by a government, or for any other reason, is wrong 7 days a week 24 hours a day 52 weeks a year and any justification of any kind is a serious sign of a completely different moral code.

Just like taking down 3, 000 innocent US citizens in a terror attack because they pay taxes and those taxes support questionable international policy is still morally unjustified in every way shape or form, 

so is the rape of women. Everyday. No matter what. Raping women is wrong.

1) we don’t have an airport to travel, so we go through jordan (we pay multiple fees to the PA, Israel, and Jordan). And Israel decides if we can leave or not.

2) there are hundreds of checkpoints between Palestinian cities and towns. Since Oct 7th, most of these checkpoints are closed, and Palestinians go through different bad and dangerous roads to reach their workplaces and travel between different locations. 

3) Israel controls the tax revenues of the PA, and use them as means to pressure the PA whenever it likes. As of now, it has been two months since Israel withheld the money, resulting in the PA not being able to pay the salaries and many ministries decreasing work days and schools going online. 

4) Israel just agreed for the Palestinians to have 3G a couple of years ago. And now, it is not allowing us to have anything more than that. 

5) Israel controls what foreigners Palestinians can marry, and it controls whether they can be issued Palestinian ID’s or not. There is qouta of 2000 ID’s per year, which Israel also uses to punish Palestinians and have paused them multiple years in the past.

Yeah, there's a difference holding the IDF to unbelievable standards, than protesting against their actions. And again, I don't think you know what zionism is. I would love if you'd define what you think zionism is.

>So criticizing Israel and IDF are fine but not fine at the same time.

Again, it all matters on how the protests go and what they're protesting against. 

>But point being, it would allow a strong anti Israel message while making it much harder to paint it as anti semitic

How is a protest against a resolution to create a Jewish state not inherently antisemitic?

>If Jim Crow was in effect today, it’d be perfectly fine to protest it even if it was hundreds of years old.

The age of the Declaration of Independence wouldn’t hurt the movement. However, what would hurt the movement is that most Americans would say burning the Declaration of Independence is tantamount to saying that Americans themselves have no rights to govern themselves, and that they should be subjugated to native will simply because the Natives had ancestors already present there when the Americans’ ancestors arrived. Americans wouldn’t exactly take this lightly. We’d probably see the strongest anti indigenous wave of racism this country has ever seen, because Americans don’t take kindly to the open declaration of the fact they’re country shouldn’t exist, even if true. 

I think what you’re thinking of is like if there was a Native protest for independence of like tribal lands, that’d be dismissed as useless people whining about losing a war 300 years ago, but if they started questioning either the existence of the United States or documents that gave Americans rights to govern themselves, there would be the strongest legal response against Natives imaginable.",2023-11-17T14:56:29+00:00

IsraelPalestine,post,Two-state solution,1aq33r3,ANAS_YEEGER,One-state solution or two-state solution?,"One-state solution or two-state solution?

This is a topic for discussion, and I'm eager to hear your opinions. Let's set aside emotions and wishes, and focus on reality and facts. Are you in favor of a one-state solution or a two-state solution?

This conflict has been ongoing for decades, with each side entrenched in its own position. The one-state option is accepted by one side but rejected by the other. Palestinians see it as their state alone, while Israel sees it as the establishment of its own state without recognizing Palestinian sovereignty. So far, no progress has been made because each side is adamant about its stance.

On the other hand, the two-state solution is disputed in terms of its borders and conditions.

From another perspective: The one-state solution is popular among the people but officially rejected, while the two-state solution is officially accepted but unpopular among the people.

Do you think the two-state solution could be a path to resolving the crisis and occupation? Do you see it as a viable option?

There are countries that have occupied others and later became accepted internationally. Could this be a possible solution, considering its success in some cases? 

Is America an example? It once occupied land but now is a recognized state. Does this mean that resolution is just a matter of time? If so, why not expedite the process now?

Just because we oppose Sykes-Picot and curse it, does it mean Palestine is its result? Why defend borders set by an adversary?

IsraelPalestine,post,Negotiations,1bztes6,sar662,What pressures Hamas in the current negotiations,"In both previous rounds of negotiations and the current talks in Cairo, Israel has faced considerable pressure from the international community to reach a negotiated settlement and cease their operations in Gaza. This pressure has taken various forms, including threats of embargo, withdrawal of political support, withholding arms shipments, financial divestment, and more. These all serve as incentives for Israel to compromise on some of their demands at the negotiating table, even if it means giving up some of their objectives in the resolution of the conflict.

Conversely, when considering the pressures that could be applied to Hamas to encourage compromise in negotiations, I'm seeing at best more limited options if not none. They don't have official forms of trade that could be embargoed or arms deals that could be halted. At most there could be diplomatic pressure from other MENA countries but that to me seems very weak. Hamas could just dismiss them and say “We've got this"" and who's gonna say boo? Iran? Turkey? Qatar?

I also considered the possiblity of internal pressures within Gaza, such as public dissatisfaction with ongoing conflict and the desire for improved living conditions. This too seems very unlikely to me because over the past 15 years Hamas has shown they don't care much about the welfare of the people living in Gaza. They're not holding elections where they can be voted out and dissent among the populace tends to be shot down. Literally.

Given this, what am I missing? What are the positive or negative pressures relevant to Hamas that could incentivize them to compromise on any of their demands at the negotiating table?

Israel has claimed that the only thing pressuring Hamas to compromise is the threat of further military action. I hope this is not the case because if it is, then Israel has no middle path between continuing full force with their military action until Hamas cries uncle and sitting down at a negotiating table and giving Hamas absolutely everything they want.",2024-04-09T14:22:26+00:00

Iran, Hamas’s long-term sponsor, has made it clear that it does not want a confrontation with the US right now. They’ve helped to restrain Hezbollah and clearly could do that with Hamas.

I also though some ambitious leader would use this opportunity to become an alternative for Hamas and gain power over their backs. And yet again this prospective had turned to be irelevant as Hamas is overwhelmingly being supported by their people, no matter the irrational behind their actions

I think now that the only true pressure Israel can put on Hamas right now (besides going into Rapha and eradicate their military wing completely) is to do the only thing that will hurt them annexing pieces of land.

But now I hear about this half-assed 'warning' they're giving, and how obvious it is that you can't move that many people out of that area in 24 hours -- plus rumors I hear that Israel knew about the impending Hamas attack well in advance of it happening and did nothing about it.

It would be first time U.S. sanctions are imposed against entire outposts and not just against individuals.

The move comes as the Biden administration ratchets up pressure on the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over a range of issues, including settler violence against Palestinians and the war in Gaza.

The second round of sanctions by the Biden administration to counter settler violence will also include sanctions against three Israeli settlers, the U.S. officials said.

A U.S. official said the sanctions against the two outposts are meant to send the message that the U.S. is targeting not only individuals but also entities that are involved in giving logistical and financial support to attacks against Palestinian civilians.

The sanctions would freeze assets the three settlers and two outposts might have in the U.S., ban them from getting a visa to enter the U.S. and block them from using the U.S. financial system.",2024-03-14T03:43:18+00:00

More than half of the people of our great country say,"" NO. You're not"" as per the poll numbers quoted by an article in NYT today .

Trump while proudly pronouncing his mental stability is not telling to us the gentle, wise and real Americans compared to his mostly uneducated, rowdy, obnoxious, sexist, racist, homophobic, Islamaphobic, just like Ms.Clinton correctly said it in a rally in 2016 that he's a very ""hostile"" person inside.

Now to understand our current 'illegitimate' president we've to learn the word 'a hostile person' or the word 'hostility' properly.

Once we do that we'll find out that Trump while being born to a very racist and horribly 'hostile' father called Fred Trump who as a member of the most infamous group called KKK used nothing but total 'hostility' mainly towards the Black communities but also to other minority groups as well.

Like I wrote earlier in one of my blogs that I'd have killed my father if I found out about what he did and how he killed other innocent people who were just living their lives in the most peaceful ways just like how Trump's father and his racist buddies lynched the Black folks in their very 'hostile' days.

But not Donald Trump.

More stories he heard from his father as a young child about how his father and his devilish gang members lynched the Black folks just because they were bored, more determined he was that he'll use the same type of hostility towards the Blacks, Mexicans, Muslims and all other minority communities to brainwash the totally racist Republicans to become the president of our great and almost diverse country before he went to the White House.

No wonder Donald made friendship with David Duke of KKK and all the members of the all the 'White Supremacists' or 'White Nationalists' by listening to his father's spirit, not only to win his election but also while trying to run this country.

So let us all say in unison that he'll not ""qualify as not smart, but genius...and a very stable genius as that !"" as he tweeted.

But our illegitimate president Trump is a very sick man.
And he should be removed from power right now legally through impeachment or by forcing the Republicans in Congress to replace him with somebody else as the 25th Amendment clearly spelled out the process.

Democrats,post,Peace process,7yvxha,ihatejoemcCarthy,"Trump and the Republicans are making the '60's movie ""The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming"" come to real life. Trump is taking the Russians' help again after his own win to make all the Republicans win their midterm elections in November to take over the congress again.","Yes, there can never be a better time than to revisit the 1966 comedy film,""The Russians Are Coming,The Russians Are Coming.""

Trump and G.O.P. have achieved something in this country that we never thought we'd ever see : The arrival of Russian govt. operatives right at the heart of our country and disturbing our peace. Our way of life. 

Our sovereignty as well in the process.

Trump, most probably because of his bipolar disorder invited the top Russian government's politburo members for a meeting in Trump Tower on June 6th of 2016 asking them what they could do to get some real dirt on Hillary.

The 8+ crooks attending that meeting also discussed how the counter intelligence officials working directly under the Russian president Putin could distribute most of the ugly truth from Hillary's campaign to the American voters who were ready to cast their votes to Trump's opponent.

The Russians promised to do their best in that infamous meeting of all the co-conspirators which Donald Jr. presided and attended by Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager.

It should be noted here that Mr. Manafort is under indictment now and ready to be sentenced for a long prison term because of the deal his assistant Rick Gates have cut with Mr. Mueller, the Special Counsel so that Mr. Gates doesn't have to spend the rest of his life in a federal prison .

So where does G.O.P. stand in all this revelations that is slowly coming to life ?

The congressional Republicans are guilty as hell for sticking with their candidate then and now their president Trump all along.

Paul Ryan, the house speaker and Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader knew for a long time that Trump obstructed the justice when he deliberately misled the reporters on 'Air Force One' soon after he took over presidency, lying on camera that he wrote the ""note"" inviting the Russians for ""adoption purposes"". 

The entire country knows now that it was a blatant lie.

He said it only to protect his son Don Jr. from prosecution which was sure to happen if Trump didn't intervene.

As per Robert Mueller, Trump 'obstructed the justice' as soon as he lied to the world by diverting the line of investigation from his son towards himself which could be O.K. if he really wrote the note in the first place.

But the fact remains, he didn't.  His son did.

Yes America, our 'illegitimate' president Trump wrote the same note word by word while he was flying in the govt. plane after he became the president so that Don Jr. doesn't have to go to jail for arranging that illegal meeting with top Russian govt.officials and very influential business people and top lawyers directly connected to Putin.

But the Republicans have decided not to follow the law by not impeaching Trump on at least this incident when he obstructed the justice by openly lying to the Americans. 

With that announcement on board the 'Air Force One' Trump deliberately misled the prosecutors by saying something like this, ""Leave the hell alone of my son. He didn't do anything wrong. I did. Go after me if you've any balls left on you.""

Go figure !",2018-02-20T13:38:33+00:00
Democrats,post,Peace process,9hze3r,ihatejoemcCarthy,"Trump who was trying hard to fake his disdain for AG Jeff Sessions, should not use an excuse now to fire his Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein. He should rather let a shrink evaluate his mental capacity so that his deputies don't have to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove him from power.","In ""Rod Rosenstein Suggested Secretly Recording Trump and Discussed 25th Amendment"" Adam Goldman and Michael S. Schmidt have given us a very enlightening piece about a possible scenario of removing Trump from power by his Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein who wanted to wear a wire under his shirt to record his delusional boss in the spring of 2017.

Two of these Op-Ed writers told us what we wanted to hear, that Trump's own Deputies including Jim Mattis and John Kelly wanted to remove their president from power by invoking the 25th Amendment to the constitution.

In my appreciation of the same Op-Ed in today's NYT, I like to say this to our illegimate president Trump, "" If you think you got a good enough oportunity to fire Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein after this Op-Ed came out in NYT , then you have a thing or two coming on your way. The American people will not tolerate your bluffing anymore to subvert the truth. They'll throw you out of power by asking your own cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment.""

So Redditors, if the NYT story is true which almost everyone including Trump thinks is true, then firing Mr. Rosenstein only on that basis that the Deputy AG thought about wearing a wire to record a madman in the White House, then Trump should know that he'll start a constitutional crisis in this country akin to Richard Nixon's attempts to fire the Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox.

We all know what happened afterwards. 

That stupid move by the Republican president Nixon forced two of his top deputies in the Justice dept. resiging in one night prompting the infamous term known to us as Saturday Night Massacre of 1973.

At the same time we also should not forget the fact that Trump will be handing over an early birthday gift to Putin long before his actual birthday of October 7th.

Why I mentioned this ?

Because nothing in this world will please Putin other than an end to the Russia inquiry which is driving him crazy.

Yes, Putin is mad that this ""fake inquiry"" as Trump and Putin call it not us, is going on in our country since the day our F.B.I. found a note linking Carter Page as a Russian agent.

No matter how much Trump tried to downplay Mr. Page's role in his campaign, we all know through the leaks in Mr. Muller's investigation that Carter Page made frequent trips to Moscow as a fake lecturer in Russian Universities while he was still acting as a Trump campaign surrogate.

So if Trump really loses his mind, as Mr. Rosenstein thought after Trump forced him to fire Mr. Comey in May 2017 by using sham excuses of not following up on Ms. Clinton's emails, then the Deputy AG's thought process, along with John Kelly's and Jim Mattis' ideas as today's Op-Ed suggested about more people working under Trump seriously discussed about invoking the 25th Amendment, was very sensible.

In the same context Trump has to know that just like Julius Caesar was neutralized by his own deputies and his own Senators in 44 B.C., most of Trump's deputies probably have the same goal in their minds. 

The only difference between his deputies and Caesar's deputies are Trump's people working under the current administration want to remove him from power in a peaceful manner by invoking an obscure amendment to the Constitution which was never used before.",2018-09-22T12:41:47+00:00

Democrats,post,Peace process,a0vduu,ihatejoemcCarthy,"Before voters in Mississippi vote today,they must realize that Trump is undermining our national security by paying big money to the dictators to send caravans before each elections. Mexico did the same on Sunday by allowing migrants to jump our border fence for promise of a big money from Trump.","it seems like Trump has attracted so many hard-partying groupies, hangers on, sheer grifters in his lifetime that it's hard to judge if anybody in his inner circle has the modicum of any character at all.

In her Op-Ed called "" Maybe They're Just Bad People"" in today's NYT, Michelle Goldberg has talked about the same type of people in Trump's orbit who're not giving him the right advice or failing to tell him right on his face that what he's doing to America's security with made up stunts of migrants rushing to our borders, is not going to pay off in the long run.

In fact the terrible game that Trump is playing now by paying for incoming caravans for election purposes, is very dangerous for the security of our country in the long run.

No wonder Michelle had to say this about Trump's followers, "" Not all Trump support is ideological.""

In other words, they're ""transactional"".

Mia love too had explained very clearly yesterday about who're the people Trump likes and who're the ones, he and his totally racist thugs that fill up his Republican party, whom they use simply as commodities.

All the Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and other minority folks who feel proud to be in Trump and the G.O.P.'s s orbits, they should know that they're being used by these racist bastards by having a ""no real relationships, just convenient ""transactions"", as per Ms. Love.

In the same context,  truth about Trump and his Republican party's desires to turn all the elections by telling sheer lies or half truths or by creating a mass hysteria among their voters about something that Americans had no clue before these cruelest people on the earth fabricated them out of thin air.

Take for instance, the theme of ""Migrant Caravan"" that Trump revives every time right before he heads to any campaigns for his equally racist Republican Senate candidates, is a very well orchestrated campaign tactic that only the educated people on the left realize how and where this huge migration of desperate people from central American countries started.

After going through each and every lies and tactics of the past Republican presidents who created wars from nowhere out of whims like the war in Iraq in 2003 or by stopping a genuine peace process in Vietnam in 1968 by G.O.P. candidate Nixon, we the Democrats have a very clear view of what's actually happening on the borders of our great country.

I hope each and every Americans know that Trump made this great country the worst ever by inviting the Russians to steal the presidential election for him.
 
The citizens and residents of our entire country have also to realize about who're the real people behind this financially bought crisis of ""Migrant Caravans"" hurtling towards our door.

By sending his V.P. Mike Pence to those 3 totally convoluted Central American countries, Trump had secured their words that those dictators would open the floodgates at their countries' borders as and when Trump was ready to head to any Campaigns for his equally crooked Senatorial candidates.

In fact this evil plan was hatched long before last summer when Trump sent his hatchet man Pence with the promise of paying more money to those dictators if they don't keep their citizens in their countries but to kick them out by using thuggery and extreme brutalities.

As a proof of my view, Trump has not stopped paying these dictators at least $75 millions on average to these dictators  from our treasury even after making fake promises to cut off that huge flow of cash if any migrants left their countries.

As we've seen before, the same ""plan"" worked perfectly well last weekend when a hundred or so able bodied migrants tried to jump the fence on the U.S.-Mexico border because of incoming Mexican president's order to his border guards to create an opening as wide as a football field in between them and the migrants so that a few hundred migrants could run towards our border fence.

It should be very clear to each and every American citizens especially the voters heading to the polls in Mississippi today that the incoming Mexican president will not hold these 9,000+ migrants in his country for free.

Trump made the similar offer to him of paying millions of dollars in cash from the U.S. Treasury and from the Republican campaign coffers that he's still paying to 3 dictators in 3 different central-American countries. 

As a proof, we could not see the same migrants jumping on our fence walls at the U.S.-Mexico border if this Senatorial race was not today but next Tuesday, Dec the 4th.

So it's really unfortunate for all the Americans like us who had to endure watching these helpless migrant children heading to our borders last week only because Trump wants his last Senate candidate for this year to win her election.

The dictators from the central American countries' are ready to kill more of their citizens as and when when Trump wants them to push those women and children out of their countries in huge caravans like they did since March this year.

Those migrants surely helped Trump's campaign speech that he delivered in two campaign stops in Mississippi last night right after those migrants pushed for our border right before Trump's campaign plane took off for this G.O.P. Senate candidate.

The rest of the Americans should know that this Senate race today   has an ugly White racist G.O.P. bitch from Mississippi who went to a segregated school in her state and still sending her kids in one of them.

For that reason alone the Republican voters of Mississippi should have the facts I'm presenting to them before they cast their votes for Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith .

They should know that Trump campaigned there to boost up the rating Of a woman whose supporters left two nooses hanging in the State Capitol last night in solidarity to her comment ""If there was a hanging,I'll be on the front seat.""

That terrible comment didn't fail to tell us what Ms.Hyde-Smith suggested otherwise that if her Black Senate opponent Mike Espy was hanged,""I'll be on the front seat.""

And what did Trump do to mitigate the effects of her comment ?

He boosted her standing among her voters by ridiculing her opponent saying ""Where this guy came from ?"" 

Everyone in this country should read that comment from that racist bastard as ""How the hell a Black man got the courage to fight an election in segregated Mississippi ?""",2018-11-27T14:36:01+00:00

Democrats,post,Peace process,5whtig,QuietCalamity,AZ Call to Action week of 2/27/17,"Via AZ LD27:

This update opens with a reality check. At this point in the legislative session, many bills have passed through committee, meaning we can no longer comment on them using RTS. This is the point where we have to get more vocal. Call your senators and representatives. Send them emails (always with the bill number and your position in the subject line). Write letters to the editors of various publications. Talk to your friends about what’s going on. Show up and speak at committee meetings for the bills for which you are most passionate. And consider making appointments with your senator and representatives to share your views with them personally. Advocating loudly in a variety of ways makes us visible, and visible citizens are more powerful. This is no time to be complacent!  

Good news: HB2287, which would have gutted Shannon’s Law by allowing the discharge of firearms 1/4 mile from an occupied structure (the bullet that killed Shannon Smith came from 1/2 mile away), has been amended. The distance language has been dropped from the bill, leaving the 1-mile range as is. Now only a few words are changing: “criminal negligence” to “intentionally, knowingly or recklessly.” THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE HOUSE and heads to Senate Government Committee Wednesday. The removal of criminal negligence as a standard is still concerning so I still suggest you OPPOSE this bill.

Tentative good news: The ESA (voucher) bills have still not advanced to the floor. Perhaps this means our voices are being heard and the bills don’t have the votes to pass? We must pay attention and stay vigilant. Continue to contact your representatives and senator with your opposition.  

Bad news: Constitutional rights on fire! Our Legislature seems to be gunning for citizens’ voting and health rights. On Thursday night, the House passed a package of bills that would make sweeping changes to the Arizona Constitution’s initiative process, and not to the benefit of voters. The Senate passed another bill packaged as “anti-abortion” but written so broadly that it would cause a great deal of pain to bereaved families, as well as danger to doctors for doing their jobs ethically.

You may be asking: WHAT CAN I DO?

Top priority: the three Urgent Alerts below. Contact the House Speaker and Senate President to demand they stop the worst bills, contact your reps and senator now with your opposition, and attend committee meetings if you can to speak in person.

If you have 30-45 minutes: Scan the RTS listings and use the system to support or oppose bills in committee.

If you have 60+ minutes: Call your reps and senator (as applicable) on all the bills headed to the floor for a vote.

 

URGENT ALERT #1: Protect our Right to Peaceful Assembly

 

SB1142: Once again, Arizona is making international news. This bill opens those who participate in or help organize a protest-turned-riot up to criminal racketeering charges, including significant jail time and seizure of assets. Even if no violence occurs, law enforcement can prosecute under racketeering laws if they think a riot might occur. Planners can be charged with racketeering even if they had nothing to do with the act of violence. The bill also expands the definition of “riot” to include disturbing the peace or destruction of property. This bill is justifiably receiving a lot of press attention: AZ Capitol Times article, AZ Republic article and columns, and international news.

 

THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE SENATE and is now headed to the House. The next step is for the Speaker to assign it to a committee. We should try to stop it there. Contact Speaker JD Mesnard (R-17) TODAY (602-926-4481 / jmesnard@azleg.gov) to urge him to refuse to assign this bill to committee. If he does this, the bill will die. How wonderful would it be if he arrived to his office on Monday morning to find his voice mail full? We can make that happen.  

URGENT ALERT #2: OPPOSE the Gutting of Voters’ Rights 

On Thursday night, the House passed a package of bills that would make sweeping changes to the Arizona Constitution’s initiative process, and not to the benefit of voters. Arizona Republic article here. HCR2029 is in Rules for Monday (see the RTS section below) and will almost certainly move to the floor this week. The other four bills are not yet on committee agendas:

HCR2002: Asks voters to repeal Proposition 105, a citizen-initiated measure that voters approved in 1998 and is commonly known as the Voter Protection Act.

HCR2007: Would exempt citizen referenda from the Voter Protection Act. That means if voters decided to overturn a law passed by the Legislature, lawmakers could go back and pass the same law, something the Voter Protection Act currently prohibits.

HB2320: Require a notice on the ballot, fundraising material and advertising related to initiatives that they can only be changed in the future by a three-quarters vote in the Legislature and if the change furthers the purpose of the original ballot measure.

HB2404: Throws up potentially insurmountable barriers to signature-gathering by requiring petition circulators to post a bond of up to $50,000, requiring background checks on signature gatherers, and making them take classes and certify they understand state law on initiatives.

 

We should try to stop these bills before they get assigned to committee. Contact Senate President Steve Yarbrough (R-17) TODAY (602-926-5863 / syarbrough@azleg.gov) and urge him NOT to assign any of these bills to a committee. If he does this, the bills will die. How wonderful would it be if he arrived to his office on Monday morning to find his voice mail full? We can make that happen.

 

URGENT ALERT #3: Stand up for Health & Reproductive Rights 

SB1367: Requires documentation by physicians and all staff present that an aborted fetus was not delivered alive, regardless of gestational age. Would require doctors to take unnecessary medical steps for a wanted child born too early to live or with a fatal defect that assures its death. Arizona Republic article here. Sponsored by Center for Arizona Policy, an extreme right-wing dark money group. THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE SENATE and is headed to the House. Contact House Speaker J.D. Mesnard (R-17) (602-926-4481 / jmesnard@azleg.gov) to urge him to NOT schedule this bill for a committee hearing.

 

SB1439: Would let health care providers continue trying to keep a person alive even if the person wants no more medical services. Sponsored by Center for Arizona Policy, an extreme right-wing dark money group. THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE SENATE and is headed to the House. Contact House Speaker J.D. Mesnard (R-17) (602-926-4481 / jmesnard@azleg.gov) to urge him to NOT schedule this bill for a committee hearing.

SB1198: Would greatly weaken ability to enforce the ADA in Arizona and restricts civil rights of the disabled. Businesses and public places have had over 30 years to comply with the ADA and do not need any further leeway.  Strongly opposed by the disability community. Headed to Senate COW. Contact your senator to OPPOSE.

 

SB1243: Requires operators of public establishments (including businesses, but excluding universities, courtrooms, high schools) to permit all persons with gun permits to carry their firearms inside unless the facility has security guards and metal detectors.

SB1315: Gives preference in custody to the parent who agrees to 50% time sharing. It harms battered women and those protecting abused children. If they are not willing to give 50% time, they may lose custody to the abuser. This bill passed out of committee and is headed to the Senate floor. Contact your senator to OPPOSE.

 

HCM2006: Urges repeal of the federal clean energy program with a coal program. PASSED Energy, Environment and Natural Resources Committee 2/14, Rules 2/20. Headed to the floor. Contact your representatives to OPPOSE.

RTS: Crossover Edition 

We are starting to see many bills passing their originating house. For these bills, the committee hearings (and RTS) now start all over again in the other house. Because of this, I am now listing bills by day of the week instead of by house.

 

Please note that for RTS, the comment follows the committee, not the bill. If you have entered RTS positions for these bills before, you will have to do them again for the new committee.

 

Monday……………………………………………………………………………………………………………..

 

HB2210: Establishes state funding for a college readiness examination for 11th graders. The test must already be administered nationwide and must be already used by colleges for admissions purposes. Supported by public education advocates. Passed Education and Appropriations, now heads to Rules. SUPPORT.

 

HCR2029: Requires signature collectors to get 10% of their signatures from each of the 30 legislative districts, 15% for a constitutional amendment. Effectively gives one legislative district veto powers over the rest. Clearly designed to make the initiative process impossibly difficult. AZ Republic covered it here. Passed House Appropriations, scheduled for Rules Monday. OPPOSE.

 

SB1317: Would allow any certified teacher to provide special education services, theoretically to give the IEP team the flexibility to decide who would be the best provider. Opposed by teachers on the grounds that not just anyone can teach special ed and that certification means something. THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE SENATE and is scheduled for House Education on Monday. OPPOSE.

 

SB1479: Requires behavioral health providers to accompany police on a mental health transportation order. It is unnecessary and the behavioral health system is already woefully overburdened. ""Tagging along"" will only pull workers from other needed areas (such as crisis prevention). Passed Senate Health and Human Services, scheduled for Rules Monday. OPPOSE.

 

Tuesday……………………….…………………………………………………………………………………..

 

SCM1001: Urges the President and Congress repeal the definition of critical habitat as including areas in which a species' presence is difficult to establish through surveys. THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE SENATE and is scheduled for House Energy, Environment and Natural Resources Tuesday. OPPOSE.

 

Wednesday………………………………………………………………………………………………………..

 

SB1239: Makes it a violation to park in the hatch area of a disabled spot. From a disability advocate: “(This bill) is not coming as an ask from those who use (disabled spots). In fact, to swing the car door wide enough for entry and exit, we often have to pull a bit into the hatch mark zone.” THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE SENATE and is scheduled for House Transportation & Infrastructure Wednesday. OPPOSE.

 

HB2022: Legalizes shooting rats and snakes with your .22 (yes, really). THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE HOUSE and is scheduled for Senate Government Wednesday. OPPOSE.

 

HB2017: Requires school bond publicity pamphlets to include the estimated total cost of a bond at the maximum interest rate and the estimated interest rate based on current market conditions. ASBA opposes. THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE HOUSE and is scheduled for Senate Finance Committee. OPPOSE.

 

HB2216: Would prohibit local government from requiring the search of a national database before the sale of guns between private owners. (This bill is being fast-tracked; see companion bill SB1122.) THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE HOUSE and is scheduled for Senate Government for Wednesday. OPPOSE.

 

HB2226: Calls for Congress to request an Article V convention to balance the budget. This would not go to the public for a vote or allow any input from citizens on budget priorities. Most progressives and some conservatives are adamantly opposed to Article V conventions as there is no control of them once they have been convened. THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE HOUSE and is scheduled for Senate Government Committee. OPPOSE.

 

HB2287: Would have gutted Shannon’s Law by allowing the discharge of firearms 1/4 mile from an occupied structure. (The bullet that killed Shannon Smith came from 1/2 mile away.) This language has been dropped from the bill. Now replaces “criminal negligence” with the words “intentionally, knowingly or recklessly.” The removal of criminal negligence as a standard is still concerning. THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE HOUSE and heads to Senate Government Committee Wednesday. OPPOSE.

 

Thursday….………………………………………………………………………………………………………..

 

HB2086: Prohibits local government from issuing a municipal ID. People who are not official residents of Arizona need these ID cards for all kinds of things – library card, cashing a check, using a credit card, etc. THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE HOUSE and is assigned to Senate Government Committee for Thursday. OPPOSE.

 

HB2238: Would remove the non-dangerous convictions of victims of sexual trafficking, many of whom are minors (for example, prostitution). THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE HOUSE and is assigned to Senate Judiciary. SUPPORT.

Democrats,post,IDF (Israel Defense Forces),1biwwgo,John3262005,Scoop: White House will propose alternative Rafah options to Israel,"The White House requested the meeting to order to try to avoid an imminent clash between the U.S. and Israel, the officials said. Both Biden and Netanyahu have drawn ""red lines"" around an Israeli operation in the southern Gaza city, where more than one million displaced Palestinians are sheltering.

The Biden administration strongly opposes an Israeli operation in Rafah and has said it is concerned Israel doesn't have an implementable plan that will protect Palestinians. Netanyahu has said Israel must go into Rafah to eliminate Hamas.

Biden caught Netanyahu by surprise when he proposed during their phone call on Monday that the prime minister send a delegation to Washington to talk about the Rafah operation. It was the first time the Israelis have heard about it, U.S. and Israeli officials told Axios.

In recent days, several alternatives to an immediate Israeli ground invasion of Rafah have been discussed inside the administration.

U.S. officials said one idea is to delay a military operation in the city and focus on stabilizing the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza, where famine is ""imminent,"" according to a UN-backed report released Monday. This plan would also involve constructing shelters for civilians evacuated from Rafah. The goal would be to reduce the potential for massive civilian casualties in an invasion, one official said.

The idea had been discussed inside the administration for several days as a way to move to a more constructive path with the Israelis, two U.S. official said. The White House realized it is not enough to tell the Israelis what not to do but there is also a need to present a U.S. alternative, the U.S. officials said.

Another idea is to focus in the first stage on securing Egypt's side of its border with Gaza as part of a joint U.S.-Egypt-Israel plan to destroy tunnels under the border and create infrastructure to prevent arms smuggling into Gaza, U.S. officials say.

On Tuesday, Netanyahu said during a meeting with the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that ""out of respect for the President"" he agreed to send a delegation to Washington so the administration can present Israel with its ideas ""especially on the humanitarian side.""

Netanyahu also said he is sending his confidants minister Ron Dermer and national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi to Washington early next week for the talks. An Israeli Defense Forces official in charge of humanitarian issues will travel with them. The delegation will not include IDF officers in charge of military planning of the operation in Rafah as the U.S. requested. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is also expected to travel to Washington separately next week for talks with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and other senior officials about the war in Gaza, Israeli and U.S. officials said.",2024-03-19T22:08:33+00:00

Read the document you yourself linked, it is my sole source for what follows...

Better than that, ill annotate it. 

**The intent of the law is that it.**

>1. Urges all States to protect the rights of persons facing the death penalty and other
affected persons by complying with their international obligations, including the rights to
equality and non-discrimination;

This is all good, and designed to be vague. but completely in line with our concept of justice. 


>**2. Calls upon States that have not yet acceded to or ratified the Second Optional Protocol
to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aiming at the abolition of the death
penalty to consider doing so;**

The second optional protocol referer to in this statute, . **Each State Party shall take all necessary measures to abolish the death penalty within its jurisdiction.**

This is where any nation that agree that some crimes, even genocide, warrant the death penalty started voting no...

It is an de facto ban on death penalty for ANY crime. 

>3. **Calls upon States that have not yet abolished the death penalty to ensure that it is not
applied on the basis of discriminatory laws or as a result of discriminatory or arbitrary
application of the law;**

There is usually no way to determine if, when i was sentenced to death, it was because i was gay. And The United nations have no organisation to make sure i was not. 

>4. Calls upon States to ensure that all accused persons, in particular poor and
economically vulnerable persons, can exercise their rights related to equal access to justice,
to ensure adequate, qualified and effective legal representation at every stage of civil and
criminal proceedings in capital punishment cases through effective legal aid, and to ensure
that those facing the death penalty can exercise their right to seek pardon or commutation of
their death sentence;

This one is all fine. great even. this is the statute i would like to see passed, without the baggage. 

>5. **Urges States that have not yet abolished the death penalty to ensure that the death
penalty is not applied against persons with mental or intellectual disabilities and persons
below 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the crime, as well as pregnant women;**

This is one of those too wague to enforce. because a mental illness in New York Might not be one in the US. but in general, i agree with it as an anti abuse law. 

>6. **Also urges States that have not yet abolished the death penalty to ensure that it is not
imposed as a sanction for specific forms of conduct such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery
and consensual same-sex relations;** 

This is the part Islamic nations rejected or refused to address..",2017-10-10T04:19:05+00:00

The White House also confirmed it has been in talks with elected leaders across the country about supporting the bill.

“We’re going on offense because guess what? There was a solution sitting right in front of you,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Tuesday of Republicans on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

“It was gift wrapped. You could have taken it. You could have helped solve this problem,” Hochul continued, “and I guarantee Republican governors on the border wanted this to happen.”

Hochul has called the border deal a “game changer” for states that are “trying to deal with this unprecedented crush of humanity.”

You reposted the post. I am asking about this point because it doesn't seem clear. Is he saying the Green New Deal is what he plans to support and use? Or that he will try to build something similar?",2020-04-14T21:46:24+00:00
Democrats,post,Two-state solution,8rr61c,ihatejoemcCarthy,"Trump is blaming the Democrats now for separating migrant children from their parents who're fleeing the extreme brutalities from their dictators in South America. Maybe a Democratic majority will separate Trump and Jeff Sessions' grandkids from their parents in a biblical doctrine of ""eye for eye"".","Trump, Jeff Sessions and most of his inner cabinet have proved the old dictum true that said ,""If assholes could fly, this place would be an airport.""

As per an article in NYT today by Kori Schake called, ""The Trump Doctrine Is Wining and the World Is Losing"", Trump and his minions like Stephen Miller working in the White House and in all the cabinet buildings all over Washington DC., have already made our entire country a giant airport with assholes like them flying off every minute.

By overstepping his authority, by blaming the Democrats for his inhuman practice of separating Spanish speaking migrant children from South America coming through the Mexican border with their parents just because they're not White Jews coming from Israel or White Caucasian Christians coming from western countries like Norway and Sweden, Trump has proven through various means that he wants to rule this country by decree.

With his kind approach towards a ruthless dictator called Kim Jong Un from North Korea whom he showered with mind boggling back bending accolades,Trump has shown to us and to the people all over the world that he'll not follow any protocol that made most of the forty-four presidents before him great.

As per Mr. Schake in his article, Trump's erratic behavior came into open when he ""rejected associating the country with 'the rules-based international order' that America had built after World War II.""

One particular behavior of him was worse than an asshole when Trump chastised the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and ""threatened him with a trade war"" only for telling the truth that there is no deficit balance of trade for the United States with Canada.

Yes, like a real asshole Trump refused to listen to Trudeau's argument that rather our country is wining by billions of dollars in surplus in the bilateral trade between the two neighbors.

Trump's core supporters, who're illiterates to the nth degree, never read any books on Economics to learn that it is a norm among countries all over the world to open up their borders for free flow of goods and services if they want to prosper in a true sense.

But Trump, being as ignorant as his supporters are, foolishly  believes that if he shuts down the border and builds up a ""beautiful wall"" with our taxpayers' money, not with Mexico's money that he promised to his stupid supporters in all his campaign rallies then he'll win in both ways.

Trump thought that with no dark Spanish speaking asylum seekers coming in to his country and with no Mexican goods and services pouring in through the southern border, he can claim victory, even if it's a false one, to his stupid followers.

""Yeah right you ""hair loss solutions"" using orange colored hair Cheetos, you'll surely win from a wall which will be built by your friends in the Wall Construction industry who'll stuff your pocket with more than $2 Billion from the $18 Billion dollars that you're asking from congress.

But don't you think that amount is way too much to ask from all the poor American taxpayers for a ""Fucking Wall"" that the ex-Mexican President said they'd never pay for it.""

No wonder every actions of Trump make all the Democrats like us sick. And we'll not rest until we remove him from power with our constitutionally given impeachment power after January 1st, next year.",2018-06-17T13:54:45+00:00

Progressive,comment,West Bank,c6qi5cy,GildasSapiens,,"More than two-thirds of Israeli Jews say that 2.5 million Palestinians living in the West Bank should be denied the right to vote if the area was annexed by Israel, in effect endorsing an apartheid state, according to an opinion poll reported in Haaretz.

Three out of four are in favour of segregated roads for Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank, and 58% believe Israel already practises apartheid against Palestinians, the poll found.

A third want Arab citizens within Israel to be banned from voting in elections to the country's parliament. Almost six out of 10 say Jews should be given preference to Arabs in government jobs, 49% say Jewish citizens should be treated better than Arabs, 42% would not want to live in the same building as Arabs and the same number do not want their children going to school with Arabs.

A commentary by Gideon Levy, which accompanied the results of the poll, described the findings as disturbing. ""Israelis themselves … are openly, shamelessly and guiltlessly defining themselves as nationalistic racists,"" he wrote.

Progressive,post,West Bank,78o95h,twomillcities,Are we alienating too many Americans with insistence that additional gun control legislation is necessary?,"Let me start by saying that if we could snap our fingers and remove all 300 million+ privately owned guns from the US, I'd sign the dotted line in a heartbeat. I believe that as a leftist, most other progressives share this view. But obviously these are idealist positions because gun ownership is so profound in the US. Any laws restricting ownership, or programs designed to incentivize citizens to trade their guns back in for tax breaks, will always leave a situation that results in millions of guns remaining in the wrong hands.

Because of this, most people who support the second amendment are turned off by any and all gun control legislation. Noncriminal gun owners see gun laws as just another way to empower criminals... and honestly it makes sense to me. Buying a gun in many states is very difficult already, and it's much easier to buy one illegally.

I am just deeply frightened at the possibility of a GOP majority continuing in the House and Senate indefinitely all because too many Americans consider politics to be generally unimportant in the context of their daily lives, and because those same Americans trust the GOP to preserve the second amendment.

I guess what I'm trying to suggest is that DEMs start considering pledges to vote against all gun control legislation in an effort to win over more voters. Republicans say they will preserve gun rights and too many moderate and conservative Americans feel this issue is more important than any other issue. Some leftist politicians seem to be more moderate on the issue and supportive of protecting gun rights but they don't campaign on it because it divides them from the party platform.

Because of this, our country is being damaged every day as a result. For one glaring example just look at last night's vote against suing banks as a group. That legislation that laughs in the face of our rights as citizens... because aside from our ability to prosecute criminals, our only recourse against corporations and institutions is to sue in civil court for monetary damages. Creating liability to provide monetary damages is often a citizen's only recourse against a bank, employer, or a corporation. To learn more about that I'd suggest watching the documentary ""HOT COFFEE"" as it details the methods of propaganda used to manipulate Americans into supporting legislation that erodes our rights.

This may be naive of me to say but I see Republicans getting away with this BS all because their constituents say ""I don't care as long as I can keep my guns and not pay higher taxes"" and give them a pass on it.

Even more frightening than my example are Ajit Pai and the GOP's attempts to destroy net neutrality. One by one, the GOP pushes legislation to erode and remove our rights as citizens and they get a pass because they wear an NRA badge. I care more about net neutrality than gun rights but I'm certainly in a minority.

Please discuss without nuking me for having one opinion that differs from most progressives... I am only trying to offer perspective and better understand why democrats keep handing elections over to the GOP simply because they refuse to make preservation of the second amendment a high priority. Aside from my views on gun rights, you'd find that I'm a Bernie Sanders leftist when it comes to almost every other political position.

Edit: i'm disappointed to see downvotes without discussion. I guess we're all happy with our election maps completely red except for a few blue states on the east and west coasts. Like dems changed positions on gay marriage, we need to be open to compromise on our positions against gun rights

The highest hurdle in having a person that is anti gun control, vote for a Democrat (Progressive or not) in House or Senate race is trust. While not from Vermont, it seems that Sanders gained that trust from his constituents. The same could be said for a person voting for a Republican that held different views on Net Neutrality.

The only way you would fully trust them, is if they have a voting record that supports their stated views, and it is in my view hard to get enough support to get elected in the first case if you deviate from the party platform. 

If gun control was dropped from the platform, it would take a decade to win back trust on a measurable level, and might effect pro gun control votes ( marginally is my guess, as who are those voters going to vote for in replacement).

Personally I would be ecstatic if this was to play out, but I don't see it happening. Simply because it would still be a talking point of the person who was running against them and would have to be addressed.

Go to YouTube and look at all the liberals who “hate” Trumps policies. They’re told about the plans Bernie had for taxes and they all say “yea that’s way smarter than what trumps doing and it’ll totally be better for lower and middle class Americans.” At the end of the videos they tell them that it’s actually Trumps current tax plans and they all get angry because they’ve lost all credibility. You’re no different from those idiots knit picking Trumps every move to serve your own agenda. We Americans will stand together on this and let you weirdos boil. You, the fake news media, gay Hollywood, and a bunch of really low IQ individuals can march and block roads. We’re gonna disregard you and keep our eyes on the future. You can cry all you want👆🏻that’s the truth.

Progressive,comment,West Bank,dovs2sg,Gus_31,,"Hillary herself tried for a short time to flip flop somewhat on guns. If you remember her Annie Oakley phase while running against Obama. It wasn't believed for a second by any pro gun people and is an extreme example not really relevant to House or Senate races, but illustrates the point that flipping your viewpoints through talking points doesn't change anything when your record indicates you feel otherwise.

If it was dropped from the platform, it could make a difference in a case by case basis. Someone running for office in say PA or WV could definitely make inroads if they are the right candidate and would probably help the most in more rural districts. 

Sanders seemed to not lose support because he voted the way his constituents wanted. For example: The Brady Bill- he voted against it when it included a wait period, but voted for it when it was amended to include the background check provision that pro gun people wanted included. Obviously Vermont is a special place and not a direct comparison to all other races nationwide, but it would be nice if everybody didn't follow the company line and could compromise a little no matter what letter they have next to their names.

Edited to add: I realize reading back I've brought up Sanders a lot. He just is a really good example of someone could buck the party a little bit due to seniority and voter base and who has shown some middle ground on this issue .",2017-10-25T19:50:03+00:00
Progressive,comment,West Bank,dp3yfpn,twomillcities,,"First off you're reading bullshit when you refer to Hillary's millions of votes. That much of your comment right there makes me see that you're an idiot. And any ""gotcha"" videos designed to support Trump are irrelevant since many are likely staged.

Secondly the GOP control the justice department. There are literally 0 investigations open against Clinton and she won't be indicted. If she isn't indicted under Trump's Sessions, she won't ever be, because there is no evidence. It's all fabricated lies and propaganda made by Trump people who don't want you to believe the truth... that he's robbing America to get even more rich.

Also regarding low IQ, the formatting, spelling, and grammar of your comment speak volumes about your IQ. You're actually not intelligent... dare I say ignorant, and dumb.

'We Americans' lol. You must not be in the 62% of Americans that disapprove of the job that Trump is doing.",2017-10-30T20:09:30+00:00
Progressive,comment,West Bank,dp3zmmf,,,"No I’m not gonna sit here and form a formal letter to you. Yes I dare say you’re of low IQ. I can tell that because you attempted to sound more educated in order to argue that you’re right and I’m wrong. The fact is I’m at work. I run the books for a brokerage and I’m too busy to argue this with you. I just looked it up and a study published by the Washington Times found that in 2008 as many as 5.7 million illegal votes were cast to get Obama in office in 2008 and then I believe a similar number for Hillary to allow her to win the popular vote. Anyway I can argue this with you after work. I get off at 5pm that’s not long from now. You can send carefully constructed letters my way all day it won’t change the facts. Like I said, see you after work.

Progressive,comment,West Bank,dp41hfn,,,"A research group in New Jersey has taken a fresh look at postelection polling data and concluded that the number of noncitizens voting illegally in U.S. elections is likely far greater than previous estimates. As many as 5.7 million noncitizens may have voted in the 2008 election, which put Barack Obama in the White House.

The research organization Just Facts, a widely cited, independent think tank led by self-described conservatives and libertarians, revealed its number-crunching in a report on national immigration.

Just Facts President James D. Agresti and his team looked at data from an extensive Harvard/YouGov study that every two years questions a sample size of tens of thousands of voters. Some acknowledge they are noncitizens and are thus ineligible to vote. Just Facts’ conclusions confront both sides in the illegal voting debate: those who say it happens a lot and those who say the problem nonexistent.

In one camp, there are groundbreaking studies by professors at Old Dominion University in Virginia who attempted to compile scientifically derived illegal voting numbers using the Harvard data, called the Cooperative Congressional Election Study.

‌
On the other side are the professors who conducted the study and contended that “zero” noncitizens of about 18 million adults in the U.S. voted. The liberal mainstream media adopted this position and proclaimed the Old Dominion work was “debunked.”The ODU professors, who stand by their work in the face of attacks from the left, concluded that in 2008 as few as 38,000 and as many as 2.8 million noncitizens voted.

Mr. Agresti’s analysis of the same polling data settled on much higher numbers. He estimated that as many as 7.9 million noncitizens were illegally registered that year and 594,000 to 5.7 million voted.

These numbers are more in line with the unverified estimates given by President Trump, who said the number of ballots cast by noncitizens was the reason he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. Last month, the president signed an executive order setting up a commission to try to find on-the-ground truth in illegal voting. Headed by Vice President Mike Pence, the panel also will look at outdated voter lists across the nation with names of dead people and multiple registrants.

For 2012, Just Facts said, 3.2 million to 5.6 million noncitizens were registered to vote and 1.2 million to 3.6 million of them voted.

Mr. Agresti lays out his reasoning in a series of complicated calculations, which he compares to U.S. Census Bureau figures for noncitizen residents. Polls show noncitizens vote overwhelmingly Democratic. Last month, the president signed an executive order setting up a commission to try to find on-the-ground truth in illegal voting.

I couldn't find a compilation of anywhere of the contact info for the members of the various Senate Committees, so I made one for people who want to target the appropriate people regarding specific cabinet appointments and legislation. Regardless of your views, I think this election has exposed a lot of dysfunction in the political system, and shown our democracy to be very unhealthy. Democracy is what happens in the years between elections, and I'm hoping that this period drives up civic engagement across America. These are high-stakes times we're living through.

From
www.disinfo.com/2011/10/16-things-libya-will-never-see-again/

16 Things Libya Will Never See Again

1.    There is no electricity bill in Libya; electricity is free for all its citizens.
2.   There is no interest on loans, banks in Libya are state-owned and loans given to all its citizens at zero percent interest by law.
3.    Having a home considered a human right in Libya.
4.    All newlyweds in Libya receive $60,000 dinar (U.S.$50,000) by the government to buy their first apartment so to help start up the family.
5.    Education and medical treatments are free in Libya. Before Gaddafi only 25 percent of Libyans were literate. Today, the figure is 83 percent.
6.    Should Libyans want to take up farming career, they would receive farming land, a farming house, equipments, seeds and livestock to kickstart their farms are all for free.
7.    If Libyans cannot find the education or medical facilities they need, the government funds them to go abroad, for it is not only paid for, but they get a U.S.$2,300/month for accommodation and car allowance.
8.    If a Libyan buys a car, the government subsidizes 50 percent of the price.
9.    The price of petrol in Libya is $0.14 per liter.
10.    Libya has no external debt and its reserves amounting to $150 billion are now frozen globally.
11.    If a Libyan is unable to get employment after graduation the state would pay the average salary of the profession, as if he or she is employed, until employment is found.
12.    A portion of every Libyan oil sale is credited directly to the bank accounts of all Libyan citizens.
13.    A mother who gives birth to a child receive U.S.$5,000.
14.    40 loaves of bread in Libya costs $0.15.
15.    25 percent of Libyans have a university degree.
16.    Gaddafi carried out the world’s largest irrigation project, known as the Great Manmade River project, to make water readily available throughout the desert country.


I have no personal knowledge of whether this is true but what I do know is ""the world"" has a tendency to take out people in the mid east who have westernized and made life better for their citizens if they make the fatal mistake of demanding more money for their countries oil. nothing else they do matters. Gaddafi had just recently been praised and very publicly embraced by the west for supposedly giving up terrorism and allowing isode inspections in his country if you will recall. But a few months ago he said he was going to charge oil companies a higher royalty for Libyan oil. BIG MISTAKE.

**""In 2004, President George W. Bush unexpectedly lifted economic sanctions on Libya in return for its renunciation of nuclear weapons and terrorism. There was a burst of optimism among American oil executives eager to return to the Libyan oil fields they had been forced to abandon two decades earlier. Gaddafi, who had been sanctioned for Libya’s role in the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, also looked forward to U.S. help in reviving his flagging oil production.**

**Yet even before armed conflict drove the U.S. companies out of Libya this year, their relations with Gaddafi had soured. The Libyan leader demanded tough contract terms. He sought big bonus payments up front. Moreover, upset that he was not getting more U.S. government respect and recognition for his earlier concessions, he pressured the oil companies to influence U.S. policies.**
**In late February 2008, Mulva was “summoned to Sirte for a half-hour ‘browbeating’ ” from Gaddafi, according to a U.S. State Department cable made available by WikiLeaks. Gaddafi “threatened to dramatically reduce Libya’s oil production and/or expel . . . U.S. oil and gas companies,” the cable said.
""**
    source  http://prorevnews.blogspot.com/2011/10/gaddafi-back-story.html

Saddam Hussein had westernized Iraq into the most westernized and educated nation in the middle east with women's rights and a high standard of living.

Gaddafi had done a similar thing.

Unfortunately for both men and probably the future lives of  the residents of those countries - they had done it by demanding that oil buyers pay them a percentage of their oil sales that was higher than the rest of the world wanted.

For example wikileaked cables showed that just months before Gaddafi suddenly became someone to depose he had proposed that Libyan oil be sold with a 73% royalty instead of a 50% royalty.
(http://wikileaks.org/cable/2009/06/09TRIPOLI438.html#)

**WikiLeaks cable makes things clear**

**""However, a cable from U.S. Ambassador Gene Kretz to the State Department on June 4, 2009, made public by WikiLeaks, shows that more recently Libya was able to force foreign oil firms, especially France’s Total, to agree to take a much smaller percentage of the oil and gas yielded from their wells, under threat of renationalization.**

**Kretz wrote, referring to Libya’s National Oil Corporation: “The renegotiation of Total’s contract is of a piece with the NOC’s effort to renegotiate existing contracts to increase Libya´s share of crude oil production. … Each consortium will take 27 percent of oil production, down from the 50 percent take they had under the previous agreement.  For gas, the consortium will take a 40 percent share (down from 50 percent), which will be reduced in the future to 30 percent. For the Mabruk field, which is located in the Sirte basin and produces some 20,000 barrels of oil per day, the new production share is 73 percent for the NOC, 20.25 percent for Total and 6.75 percent for StatoilHydro.” (“06.04.2009: French Total-led consortiums accept lower production shares in Libya” — WikiLeaks document published in Aftenposten)**

**As the U.S. ambassador well understood, this effort by the Libyan government to get more control over its most valuable resource would antagonize the imperialist oil companies and their rich capitalist owners.  No wonder that France was the first country to recognize the rebel regime in Benghazi!""**

(much more on each cable at http://openoil.net/2011/10/13/libyas-oil-industry-and-wikileaks/)

My guess is that in both Iraq and Libya that if oil every flows again in any quantity (which oil producers DON'T want because that lowers their prices and profits on oil) the royalties will be less.

Then you know ignorant atheists. Zionism has been an overwhelmingly secular movement and the claim to Israel is overwhelmingly secular. But more to the point, so what? I know atheists who are pro-Israel. How is the move of the capital an atheist issue?

> Some atheists chose the Democratic party because of their supposed ""secular"" positions. This last minute decision betrays their trust and mine. How do you not see this as problematic?

I'm waiting for you to make the argument that there is a religious component here. Not your general objection to Israel, the reason why atheists would have particular objection. By the facts Jews have been in Jerusalem for about 2,500 years, but the facts they have had a strong demonstrable cultural attachment. By the facts the state of Israel exists and is recognized by both the UN and the U.S. The state of Israel declares that its capital is in Jerusalem and this is the only place where the world refuses to recognize the country's declared capital. So show me how this is actually a religious issue.

Well, should there? Surely that depends on whether everything they've done can reasonably be expected to be sufficient. I'm not at all sure that all businesses are capable of creating a safe environment for employees at the moment. I mean some surely are, but others have too many people in too close quarters with too little ventilation. If they require employees to work in those environments should they be protected from the ensuing liability? It seems to me the business should bear the liability since they are in the position to set the policies. If the policies are sufficient and are followed, the employees should be safe. If they are insufficient and the business is unwilling or unable to fix them, perhaps they shouldn't be open right now.",2020-08-03T07:23:10+00:00

Progressive,comment,Conflict,g0box3x,dungone,,"It helps to understand the nature of the rules to begin with.  The job of the CDC isn't to keep you from getting sued.  Its to slow down infections. There is no monitoring in place to ensure anyone is following the rules.  The CDC isn't OSHA. So saying that you followed them is meaningless.

Getting sued for spreading the disease should be the least of your concerns.  You should face criminal liabilities if you do, especially if you do ""break the rules"" so to speak.  Being legally vulnerable is precisely the kind of tool that public health officials need in order to slow the spread of infections.  If you can't afford the lawsuits, that is the best way to get employers to self-monitor the conditions in their workplaces.

Conversely, making employers immune to lawsuits during a runaway pandemic is only going to make the disease spread faster still.  Which is the opposite of the goal of the CDC and the guidelines it's creating.",2020-08-04T13:36:28+00:00

It's not though. You can argue that the way it's calculated is incomplete or not that great (which I probably agree with) but it's not an arbitrary number, and it was originally determined based on the cost of food (so yes, not housing, or clothes, or utilities, or health care, or anything else) and adjusted to inflation since then.

> It's not even adjusted gross income, just your gross.

Does that make a difference? I'd assume the vast majority of the people close to the FPL would take the standard deduction, so if you based it on MAGI and just adjusted the FPL by the standard deduction you'd probably get about the same thing.

> So, it's really no surprise that the increased unemployment benefits actually lifted people out of poverty seeing as how the extra $600/week was equivalent to $15/hr or more than double what's required for someone to be in ""poverty.""

I mean, yes. If you give people money they're less poor. Not sure what your point is, they still have more money so they can buy more things.

> it doesn't mean that people's lives will suddenly be better, it means that they made just enough more to not be under the poverty line anymore

It doesn't mean that they're lives are *good*, or that they can afford to live decently, but it definitely does live that their lives will be better than when they were below the FPL. Maybe the extra cash didn't improve their lives but enough, but it certainly did *some*.

> All this talk about reducing poverty is meaningless as long as the ""poverty"" line is this arbitrary standard divorced from the reality of being able to afford basic necessities.

Again, maybe it's not *enough*. But it's better to be above the FPL than below. And unless the programs are targeted to bring people up to exactly the FPL, I'm not sure how your issues with that specific threshold matter all that much. At the end of the day programs to reduce poverty are programs to increase the resources available to the poorest Americans.

Progressive,post,Peace process,2r1ucz,CylonSpring,"On gun culture, prisons and capital punishment","
I'm not going to fill this post with stats and references; this isn't CMV or ELI5 and I'm not really trying to convince anyone of anything. The data and studies are out there if you want them; if you haven't particularly kept track, some of it's pretty eye opening (and fairly alarming). 
 
We've all heard the justifications from the right: we need more prisons to lock away all the criminals; more guns to keep us safe; any attempt to regulate them is an attack on our ""freedoms"" which only hurts law abiding citizens and helps criminals; kill the killers so they can't kill again. 

To some this is the very voice of reason- it can be made to sound that way; except that it's mostly fabrications and falsehoods, straw arguments used as cover for a retribution mentality. ""We're the good guys"", this way of thinking goes, ""we're just trying to keep you safe and impose a little order amongst all this chaos"". 

It's all very seductive, this line of unreasonable reasoning- we all want to think of ourselves as the ""good guys""; but it's more than just a little disingenuous as well- maybe we'd be the ""bad guys"" too, except for the ""there but for the grace"" of extenuating circumstances and the fortunes of birth. 

There's a troubling lack of empathy or attempts at understanding in this type of argument; an over-simplification, a callousness, a sense of hubris. 

Our incarceration rate per capita is among the highest in the world, with the vast majority of inmates there for non-violent crimes. We build prisons now the way we once invested in schools; we've turned prison building into a self-sustaining for profit industry- there's plenty of lawful cash to be made in the business of incarcerating the lawless (and the unfortunate). 

Any system designed to capitalize on the misery and misfortunes of others, be it criminal justice or healthcare (deserving of its own discussion), seriously needs to be called into question. 

We call it ""rehabilitation"", we call it ""corrections"" but this, too, is disingenuous; it's largely punitive, pure and simple. We've taken crime and institutionalized it; beyond the most token of efforts, we don't seem to be terribly concerned with rehabilitating anybody. 

Anyone who truly frees themselves from the cycle of crime and violence within our criminal justice system more often does so in spite of it, not because of it. 

The death penalty is old fashioned, Old Testament ""eye for an eye"" vengeance thinly veiled as ""justice"" for the victims and the bereaved. It's not an effective deterrent. Implemented haphazardly and disproportionately, there's little consistency in it. It can't bring back those who are lost. Most of the bereaved who go through this journey along with the condemned report that the experience fails to bring them any sense of closure or peace in the wake of its conclusion. 

How many innocent people have been or could have been acquitted through the use of DNA testing, to say nothing of sufficient and competent representation? It's horrendously expensive to execute someone (and it SHOULD be, given the stakes), and when it is carried out, it's frequently botched; serving as the very definition of ""cruel and unusual"". 

Frankly, it's barbaric to believe that one horrific act by an individual sanctions a second by the state on behalf of ""the people""; it's the rationale that one might expect to find in a vindictive five year old who simply doesn't know any better. 

None of this is to say that society doesn't require protection from those who would simply disregard the laws of civilized behavior or those with a blatant disregard for their fellow human beings. Yet justice itself needs to be tempered with compassion, civility, and humanity on behalf of those it claims to represent, if it is to have meaning, if it is to be considered truly just. 

And the process must be considered incomplete if it does not seek to understand and mitigate the factors involved in the crimes it investigates; if in all but the most egregious of cases, no honest efforts at true rehabilitation are made. 

Until we, as a society are just as determined to acknowledge and address the underlying factors contributing to crime as we are in the pursuit and punishment of it, we aren't solving anything. 

Guns, claimed to make us safer, almost always fail to do so. The seemingly endless accounts of preventable gun tragedies in the form of accidents, preventable suicide, mishaps involving children and misplaced vigilantism fill our newspapers and haunt our memories. 

The embracement of vengeance, of ""us vs. them"", of primitive thrills to be found in violent things and the schadenfreude we indulge in as a society calls for a thoughtful response of emotionally maturity, and a deep look at the reflection we see in the mirror. 

Is it us we see there, or merely vestiges of the something better we could have become, and have somehow, chosen not to? 


TL;DR  Capital punishment, more guns and prisons presided over by private institutions don't make us safer, and aren't solutions to crime. A love affair with firearms and a focus on punitive retribution over sincere efforts at rehabilitation, especially while failing to address many of the underlying factors contributing to crime, is damaging to our social fabric and unworthy of a society which prides itself on its enlightenment.

Accidents are a rather negligible part of the problem despite how the media makes it seem like a common occurrence. They accounted for a fraction of a percent of deaths over the past several years, [.2% in 2010](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_04.pdf) and .3% in 2011(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_06.pdf). And [accidental injuries requiring a visit to the hospital was less than those from pedal bikes.](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ahcd/nhamcs_emergency/2010_ed_web_tables.pdf) For suicide I haven't seen any evidence that shows that firearms drive suicide and that it is mostly culture and availability that makes them prevalent in suicides. We also know that [suffocation methods](http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/suicide/statistics/case_fatality.html) are nearly as effective. Given the unremarkable suicide rate the US and the Swiss have despite the availability of firearms while other countries practically devoid of guns have higher suicide rates I would say suicide is not really a gun issue.

Progressive,comment,Peace process,cnbufpa,Endomlik,,">While I'll never understand the fascination with (and devotion to) firearms in our culture, i do acknowledge there are legitimate uses for them; I guess I see them as a sometimes necessary evil. But what I'm talking about is the idea perpetuated in our society which suggests that everyone should be armed or that doing so would somehow reduce crime or violence when that's so clearly not the case. 

I really don't believe in either side's argument.  Guns don't prevent crimes and guns don't increase crime rates.  People's needs, wants, and desires are what cause crimes.  Guns are just tools that we use in life.  I feel that if we create a system where people's needs and wants are met legally then we'll only have to deal with crimes of passion (spouse kills spouse with a *insert weapon*).

Progressive,post,Peace process,qi31r,Samuel_Gompers,"For a Just Freedom and a Straight Deal: A 21st Century Plan to Rescue Working America (Inspired by the post for a ""New Deal Party"")","* Creation of a Public Works Administration with an $850 billion appropriation. PWA offices will be set up in each state and states and municipalities can submit projects for consideration. Pending approval of the state offices, projects will be forwarded to Washington for final approval. Approved projects will then be put through a bidding process in order of priority with self-liquidating projects first, then economically useful, then by employment potential. Bids will be solicited from private contractors and the state or municipality will be given a combination of loans and grants to pay; every county in the nation will be guaranteed at least one project. 

* Establishment of a Bureau of Public Housing  and a Bureau of School Reconstruction within the Public Works administration to liaise with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Education.

* Creation of a Civilian Conservation Corps modeled as a domestic version of the Peace Corps funded by the Public Works Administration and jointly administered by the Department of the Interior and the Department of Defense; the newly created CCC will be a uniformed service. 

* Creation of a Reconstruction Finance Corporation. This will be a bank capitalized at $100 billion chartered to make loans to small businesses (defined as having under 50 employees/independent contractors or some combination thereof). Offices will be opened in major metropolitan areas with the option of online applications for those who cannot make a trip. Approval processes will be similar to the PWA, except that approval will be by state headquarters with oversight from Washington. 

* Creation of several new tax brackets above the current top bracket in consultation with Treasury Department officials. Suggested brackets include $375K-$500K, $500K-$750K, $750K-$1M, $1M-$5M, $5M-$10M, $10M-$25M, and $25M+. Top marginal rates will not exceed 70% (this figure being chosen as the historical rate at the height of the Vietnam War during the Nixon Administration, it is certainly not absolute).

* Implementation of a modernized Glass-Steagall Act. The original Act mandated the separation of investment and commercial banks as well as insurance firms. The new Act would not require existing banks to break up or divest themselves of certain parts. There would, however, be a mandated statutory separation of business, commercial, and insurance accounts so that operations of one would not directly affect the others. 

* Appointment of a Special Executor within the Securities and Exchange Commission to oversee the transformation of financial companies in compliance with the new Glass-Steagall Act; the first appointment to the SEC will be modeled on how William O. Douglas behaved as chairman.

* Appointment of a Special Investigator in the Federal Trade Commission into the status of American anti-trust laws; upon delivery of the report, a Special Prosecutor will be appointed to act on the information contained within.

* Creation of a Division of Finance and Trading within the Department of Justice and appointment of a special prosecutor to work with the SEC in investigating and prosecuting financial crimes. 

* Creation of a Pigouvian tax on financial market transactions deemed to have significant risk of negative externalities (with determination done by an independent agency of the government or Congressional committee investigation).  

* Significant revision of the National Labor Relations Act. Repeal of section 14(b) in totality and repeal from section 4(a) the following clause:

>> Nothing in this Act [subchapter] shall be construed to authorize the Board to appoint individuals for the purpose of conciliation or mediation, or for economic analysis.

*  Amendment of the same Act to eliminate permanent strike replacements, extend coverage to agricultural and domestic workers, and require mandatory first contract mediation then arbitration. NLRB will be given powers to impose fines for repeated or severe violations of unfair labor practice protections (subject to review by courts of appeal) and employees will be given the right to seek compensatory damages for wrongful discharge in addition to any awarded back wages.

* Amendment of the Fair Labor Standards Act in order to apply the minimum wage to tipped employees; amendment of the same act to create a National Wage and Hour Mediation Board with powers similar to the newly constituted National Labor Relations Board in order to hear complaints brought under the Act. Decisions of the Board will be subject to review by Courts of Appeal. 

* Amendment of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to add ""sexual orientation"" to the five existing protected classes (race, color, religion, sex, and national origin). 

* Amendment of the Davis-Bacon Act (the prevailing wage law for all federal public works contracts) to cover all federal contracts in general.

* Elimination of income cap on FICA taxes for Social Security and Medicare. Creation of a President’s Commission on Social Benefit Reform to deliver a report suggesting subsequent action needed if any on both Social Security and Medicare.  

* Creation of a National Health Administration to administer Medicare on an opt-in basis competing with private insurance companies. 

* Raise in minimum wage to ~$8.50 first three years then $8.75 an hour after that.

* National Space Exploration Act: $50 billion appropriation to NASA with another $25 to $50 billion guaranteed from PWA grants.

* Creation of a Special Committee on Defense Efficiency co-chaired by representatives from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Council in order to identify any possible reductions or savings available in the Department of Defense. 

* Institution of a policy of rapprochement with Central and South America and the Caribbean, including Cuba, but focusing on Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. Selection of a special envoy to Cuba to begin discussions on normalizing relations. 

* Call a special meeting of the Organization of American States to discuss methods of reducing drug related gang violence.

Progressive,comment,Peace process,c3xs49e,Samuel_Gompers,,"I find it pretty useless to speculate on things like Iraq and Afghanistan in conjunction with a post like this because foreign policy is much more reactive than domestic foreign policy. Barring some sort of collective political amnesia, this platform isn't going anywhere anytime soon, so I'm assuming that Iraq and Afghanistan won't be the issues they are now. Obviously, I have opinions on those issues, but I'd discuss them elsewhere. 

There's one thing I forgot to add about ratifying the International Labor Organization's core labor standards, which are four really controversial ideas that the United States has refused to sign: 

* Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining; 

* The elimination of forced and compulsory labor; 

* The abolition of child labor; and 

* The elimination of discrimination in the workplace

As far as other things go, I could have included something like a concept of ""fair trade"" which takes other nation's labor standards into account when making free trade agreements so that American workers won't be competing with wage-slaves or, worse, actual slaves. 

I also think that treaty obligations are the foundation of international law, so I don't like breaking them, especially unilaterally. A lot of people make a big deal out of NATO for the United States being the policeman of the world, but I am not willing to sacrifice the most powerful military alliance in human history. I would suggest, however, negotiations with Germany to reduce U.S. presence there outside of military hospitals and have the Bundeswehr pick up the slack. Germany needs to buck up on it's military budget a little bit. Hopefully this will be after the Eurozone comes back from the brink of collapse (if it collapses, we're all fucked). 

On the other side of the world, we have the ANZUS treaty and Major Non-NATO Allies. This is all to do with North Korea. Once North Korea either collapses internally or, god forbid, pulls the trigger on a war with the South, the US can and should relax troop deployments in the area. Until then though, it's in the best interests of the U.S., the world, and humanity to keep South Korea's defense guaranteed. Better to have a trading partner and successful economy than the entire peninsula a dictatorial hellhole.   

I also totally forgot an area of domestic policy, which is industrial policy. There's a quote by Leo Amery, who was a British MP in the early 20th century, which, while aggressive, sums up my feelings on manufacturing, science, and industry in general: 

> ""The successful powers will be those who have the greatest industrial base. It will not matter whether they are in the centre of a continent or on an island; those people who have the industrial power and the power of invention and of science will be able to defeat all others."" 

I would replace ""will be able to defeat all others"" with ""will be able to lead mankind;"" this is where I indulge in a bit of Gingrich'esque moon base thought (if we ever have a moon state, I want to name it Apollo, FYI). 

To return to reality though, industrial policy is basically the combined use of targeted corporate tax cuts, investment and capital tax credits, tax expenditures, targeted subsidies and tariffs, and public-private research and development in order to promote the growth and strength of key strategic industries.

About how Nixon's Detente (his ending of hostilities with Russia) was sabotaged, resulting in U.S. taxpayers paying a huge price in Trillions & Trillions of tax dollars given 2 scheming ""Defense"" industry","""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA""; By Anne Hessing Cahn

Book review in the ""Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists"" January, 1999

No. 1, Vol. 55; Pg. 70

By Warnke, Paul C. (reviewer)

Killing Detente is a highly readable account of an ill-considered and maladroit exercise in intelligence reassessment that delayed--but did not derail--detente, the process of accommodation that occurred between Washington and Moscow in the mid-1970s.

In presenting her analysis of what became known as the Team B exercise, Anne Cahn uses her extensive experience in international affairs, a careful review of many previously unavailable documents, and interviews with key individuals involved in the affair. (I should disclose that I worked with the author at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Committee on National Security, and reviewed drafts of some chapters of her book.)

Shortly after Gerald Ford succeeded Richard Nixon, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) began to push for an alternative review of Soviet strategic capabilities, contending that the National Intelligence Estimates prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) might be understating Soviet strategic strength. Competent analysts, however, had criticized the CIA's reports as greatly **overstating** Soviet military expenditures. **[WhereIsFiber's note: The Soviets, now the Russians, have always spent a small fraction on defense compared to our wildly wasteful U.S. ""Defense"" budgets. The USA spends on ""Defense"" what the next 12 countries combined spend on defense. That's why our economy is just limping along and our national debt has skyrocketed to 19 Trillion, and dangerously rising.]**

In late 1975, then-CIA Director William Colby responded negatively to the PFIAB proposal and disagreed with its contention that the agency's intelligence estimates erred by ""projecting a sense of complacency."" But President Ford, engaged as he was with Ronald Reagan's challenge for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination, was sensitive to possible fight-wing criticism. He eventually authorized the Team B adventure.

The initial idea was to appoint three panels of outside experts that would assess, respectively, the threat to U.S. ICBM survival created by Soviet missile accuracy, the Soviet anti-submarine warfare capability against U.S. nuclear missile submarines, and the extent to which Soviet air defenses could prevent penetration by strategic bombers.

The navy, however, considered information about the operational aspects of submarine patrols and whether they might be trailed by Soviet assets as information that could not be shared, even with the CIA. The second panel, accordingly, was reoriented to deal with Soviet strategic objectives. It is the work of this panel that is generally referred to as the Team B Report.

Whatever might be said for evaluation of strategic capabilities by a group of outside experts, the impracticality of achieving useful results by ""independent"" analysis of strategic objectives should have been self-evident. Moreover, the futility of the Team B enterprise was assured by the selection of the panel's members. Rather than including a diversity of views, as was recently done in putting together the, so-called Rumsfeld Commission on the ballistic missile threat, the Strategic Objectives Panel was composed entirely of individuals who had made careers of viewing the Soviet menace with alarm.

As the author notes, the panel's chairman, Richard Pipes, has been called the ""intellectual godfather"" of the thesis that the Soviets had rejected nuclear parity and were bent on fighting a nuclear war. **[My note: This is laughable.]** In an interview, Pipes told Cahn that he wrote most of the first section of the report, which criticized the CIA for underestimating the ""intensity, scope, and implicit threat"" posed by the Soviet Union, by using evidence relating to capabilities rather than intentions. This section argued that the really important evidence demonstrated that ""Soviet leaders are first and foremost offensively rather than defensively minded."" **[Note: Haha, if you're going to waste Trillions of U.S. taxpayers' money on ""Defense,"" you need a big boogeyman/bogeyman, a scary ""enemy,"" a phantom menace. The reality is the U.S. foisted the Cold War on the Russians.  The Russians wanted to be our ally, just like the French are our ally.  In fact, the Russians were our allies during World War 2 against the Nazis.  After World War 2, U.S. war mongers started the Cold War against Russia.  No less than double Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling has said the Soviets/Russians did not want the Cold War.]**

It is now entirely clear, however, that by the early 1970s Soviet leaders had concluded that the Soviet Union could not win, and might not even survive, a nuclear war. Anyone thereafter dealing with Soviet officials could readily recognize that they held no illusions about having military superiority over the United States and its allies. They were completely aware that NATO was a security alliance with a solidarity and common purpose that could not be ascribed to the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact. Even the dullest of Soviet leaders must have known that a limited nuclear war would almost certainly have meant the destruction of the Kremlin--and thus of the Soviet empire.

Detente was not doing too well when Team B met in 1975. It had been badly damaged by the U.S.-Soviet confrontation precipitated in 1973 by the Israeli-Egyptian war. In October of that year, the encirclement of Egypt's Third Army by Israeli defense forces prompted Leonid Brezhnev to call for joint U.S.-Soviet intervention to stop the fighting. Otherwise, suggested the Soviet premier, the Soviet Union might consider acting alone. In response to this muted threat, the United States called a worldwide alert of both its conventional and nuclear forces.

Although the crisis soon passed, it cast a continuing chill on the dialogue between Washington and Moscow. The Team B Report was a further blow to detente and, as the author observes, it provided ""intellectual fodder"" for the Committee on the Present Danger, which was spearheaded by former Undersecretary of State Eugene Rostow. In its first policy statement, released two days after the 1976 presidential election, the committee stated that ""the principal threat to our nation, to world peace, and to the cause of human freedom is the Soviet drive for dominance based upon an unparalleled military buildup."" **[Lol. You accuse your ""enemy"" of what you, yourself, are most guilty.]** The Soviet Union, the committee concluded, ""has not altered its long-held goal of a world dominated from a single center--Moscow."" **[The jokes keep coming.]**

Not surprisingly, the founding board members of the Committee on the Present Danger included Team B members Richard Pipes, Foy Kohler, Paul Nitze, and William Van Cleave. When Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, Pipes was named the president's special adviser on the Soviet Union and, in a masterpiece of miscasting, Eugene Rostow, the motivating force behind the Committee on the Present Danger, became director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.

Fortunately, Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power and the rapport he developed with Ronald Reagan, beginning with their first meeting in Geneva in 1985, put an end to superpower confrontation politics and, in a few years, to the Soviet Union itself. In the interest of fairness, I must note that Team B member Paul Nitze played a constructive role in that process as arms control adviser to Secretary of State George Shultz.

Although detente in the long run survived the right-wing attack, **[this book was published in 1998 during Bill Clinton's presidency, so, no, detente did not survive the Bush/Cheney regime and the ""Project For a New American Century,"" the 21st Century's equivalent of the anti-Nixon, anti-detente ""Team B"" liars]** the painful consequences of the Team B affair can still be felt in the diversion of massive funds from genuine human needs to a grossly excessive U.S. military buildup.

""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA"" author Anne Cahn voices warm appreciation for the legal work that gave her access to previously undisclosed documents through the Freedom of Information Act. But it is the author's thoughtful analysis of these documents and her searching interviews with key players that give Killing Detente its scope and depth.

Previously we knew little about the Team B Strategic Objectives Panel apart from its report. We now know that the way its members were selected and the manner in which it operated virtually preordained its conclusions. Not only is Anne Cahn's book of historical interest and useful as a teaching tool, but it is also a valuable study of how not to set defense policy.

I don't want you to just believe me. I have given you links so you can scrutinize my argument fully. Check up on me. Am I making this stuff up or exaggerating? Every effort has been made to use unimpeachable sources of primary data, such as the World Bank, the United Nations and highly reputable polling organizations like Pew and Latinobarmetro, which is a Chilean polling organization whose work features regularly in the Economist, Wall Street Journal and New York Times. Let's get mythbusting!

**The Accusation** Chavez led a coup. It is often remarked that Chavez led a coup in 1992. Two example is [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/opinion/hugo-chavez-departs.html) New York Times article and [this](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/key-events-in-hugo-chavezs-rise-to-power-and-presidency-in-venezuela/2013/03/05/8a4dddcc-85e1-11e2-a80b-3edc779b676f_story.html) Washington Post article. Conveniently, the context of the coup is left out. Despite producing more the $300 billion of oil wealth between 1958-1998, the equivalent of 20 Marshall Plans, the majority of Venezuelans were living in shocking slums. By the 1990s, quality of life indicators for ordinary Caracas residents were  below Port-Au-Prince, Haiti. Between 1970 and 1997, workers' incomes declined by [50%, while poverty doubled between 1984 and 1991](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30040274?uid=3738032&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21101776675521)

President Carlos Andres Perez, on orders from the IMF, increased oil prices for Venezuelans. This led to increases in transport costs, to the point where Caracas residents were spending, on average, 25% of their entire wages on bus fares.  (Jones, B. [“Hugo!](http://www.amazon.com/HUGO-THE-CHAVEZ-STORY/dp/1847920055/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1362578797&sr=8-2&keywords=hugo+bart+jones) p. 116) Food riots broke out and Perez sent the army in. 3 days of terror ensued. The LA Times' Bart Jones speaks of Red Cross workers being gunned down in the street, “mass graves” being filled with “mutilated corpses”, “tied up corpses” with “bullets in the back of their heads” and children being gunned down as the armies fired indiscriminately into shanty towns. (Jones, B. [Hugo!](http://www.amazon.com/HUGO-THE-CHAVEZ-STORY/dp/1847920055/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1362578797&sr=8-2&keywords=hugo+bart+jones) pp.121-124) Much of the army leadership was deeply shocked at this. They began to gather around a young Colonel called Hugo Chavez and conspired to rebel against the President. The rebellion of 1992 failed, and Chavez was sentenced to what amounted to a life sentence, yet, the rebellion was so popular with the public that the new president, Rafael Caldera was essentially forced to release Chavez just 2 years later. After getting out he immediately began to organize for a Presidential election.

**Myth: Partially confirmed**

Myth 2- The Venezuelan economy is a shambles. In [this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/09/wikileaks-oil-giants-squeeze-chavez) Guardian article, the author wonder how long the Venezuelan economy can totter on. Figures from the World Bank, hardly a Chavez ally, show a different story. Venezuela's GDP has [more than tripled under Chavez,](http://i.imgur.com/CyeLEvC.jpg) while net national income [has also nearly tripled.](http://i.imgur.com/gKd5YBs.jpg) Meanwhile, both the [United Nations Development Project](http://i.imgur.com/cdaFIOv.jpg) and the [World Bank](http://i.imgur.com/eKaova1.jpg) agree that unemployment has dropped from over 11% to under 8%. When asked themselves, Venezuelans have the [highest confidence in their economy of any Latin American country.](http://i.imgur.com/QtZ7L3x.jpg) Venezuela's external debt has [dropped precipitously.](http://i.imgur.com/rJSNmaS.jpg) Meanwhile, Venezuela's stock market is the [best-performing](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/dec/31/venezuela-best-stock-market-2012) in the [world.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/venezuela/stock-market) You may have heard stupid Chavez is causing massive inflation, [but the facts are the opposite](http://i.imgur.com/uSq7BFY.jpg). One year before Chavez took office, inflation was an eye-watering 103%. It is now in the teens. The high-point inflation under Chavez was lower than the lowest inflation under the previous 2 presidents. 

**Myth: Busted**

**Myth: Chavez is a dictator**
This one is so ubiquitous I won't give examples. 

Voter turnout in Venezuela in the October 2012 election was above [80%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_2012), higher than any election in US history. Under Chavez, voter turnout in Venezuelan elections has increased by 135% (1998 turnout: [6.3mil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_1998), 2012 turnout:[14.8 mil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_2012). That means almost two and a half times as many people vote nowadays than in the 1990s. The number of registered voter has risen by over 70% under Chavez.

Jimmy carter and the Nobel Peace Prize-Winning Carter Center recently stated [“the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world.”](http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=8935#.USvSHnMnty4) The European Union Election Observation Mission agreed, saying [“the system developed in Venezuela is probably the most advanced in the world to date”](http://embavenez-uk.org/pdf/fs_democracia.pdf) The number of polling stations has increased by [38% in 10 years.](http://www.cartercenter.org/documents/1151.pdf) One year pre-Chavez, only [11% of Venezuelans](http://i.imgur.com/1JOmBJZ.jpg) believed elections were clean. By 2006, [2/3 believed they were.](http://i.imgur.com/BdT8eFj.jpg) Venezuelans rate their democracy the [second best in Latin America](http://i.imgur.com/MWs264L.gif).

**Myth: Chavez Controls the Media** There appears to be an authoritarian dictator crushing freedom of the press in Venezuela. We read about it all the time. How many free outlets are left?

As Mark Weisbrot has shown in an extensive study, the Venezuelan state owns [about 5% of all media outlets.](http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/2010_12_venezuela_media.pdf) Both the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19368807) and [Le Monde](http://mondediplo.com/2002/08/10venezuela) agree on the 5% figure. For comparison, state-owned media account for 40 and 37% of British and  French TV. 9 out of the top 10 selling newspapers in Venezuela are virulent anti-Chavez, and by virulent, Le Monde Diplo calls it [“hate media”](http://mondediplo.com/2002/08/10venezuela) while Richard Gott in the Guardian says the largest station, RCTV is a [“white supremacist channel”](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/jun/07/comment.venezuela) and JMH Salas reports that they regularly assault him with words like [“sambo, thick-lipped monkey” “ape”](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30040277?uid=3738032&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21101777011571) (Chavez is the first-non white President) In contrast to what we read, Venezuelans believe there's [about as much freedom of speech as there is in Spain](http://i.imgur.com/hD8PQxY.jpg) **Myth: Busted**

**Myth: There are food shortages in Venezuela**

Actually, venezuela has [doubled the amount of cereals it produces](http://i.imgur.com/qPybLCY.jpg) in just 10 years, [as have milk, eggs and pork](http://imgur.com/agUo7ym). Child malnutrition has dropped by [2/3 in 10 years](http://i.imgur.com/OeoP3DQ.jpg), too. So, are there food shortages? Look at this [anti-Chavez blogger's post.](http://daniel-venezuela.blogspot.co.uk/2007/05/food-shortages-in-venezuela.html) He shows that food shortages mean the most popular mayonnaise is gone, but there are clearly 4 or 5 other brands still available. Again, white sugar is gone but there is plenty of brown left. Only one brand of powdered milk is left. The reason for this is Chavez instituted price-controls and gave people jobs, increasing their purchasing power. This meant for the first time in their lives, ordinary people can afford dairy produce. If you think about the logic behind this, you can find out a lot about how the media see ordinary people. In the 1990s when children were dying from malnutrition, there were no stories of food shortages, but now that rich people like themselves can't find Kraft mayonnaise and have to settle for Hellmans, that is a shortage. **Myth: Busted**

**Myth:** Venezuela is the most dangerous place in the world

There can be no doubt that there are many murders in Venezuela, as this chart of [reported homicides shows.](http://i.imgur.com/0j1zklT.jpg). Those claiming crime was the country's major problem increased from less than [1% in 2001](http://imgur.com/2npBf1b) to [65% in 2010](http://imgur.com/kk2DuUN). And yet, when asked whether they or their family were victims of crime, “yes” dropped from [49% in 2000](http://i.imgur.com/SRufLZk.jpg) to [28% 2010](http://i.imgur.com/3u0luhO.jpg). Your chances of being a victim of crime have dropped by half while your fear of crime has spiked 6500%, which leads me to believe it is a media circus. Several writers have pointed to an orchestrated campaign by the media to focus on crime, and not the progress Venezuela has made. 

**Myth: Partially Busted**

**Myth Hugo Chavez is anti-semitic**

The entire case for this comes from a quote where Chavez spoke ill of “those who crucified Jesus”. When read in context, it cannot be taken as such. He gave a list of traitors. He mentioned those who doubled-crossed Simon Bolivar, those who crucified Jesus, those who betrayed Che Guevara, etc. [Here's a pic](http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5645) of Chavez meeting the leading Rabbi in venezuela. I might add that this is common tactic of the US elite. A New York Times search for [“Nicaragua anti-semitism”](http://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/#/anti-semitism+nicaragua/) shows no hits for 130 years, a slew of stories between 1983-1986, when the left-wing Sandinistas were in charge, then nothing for 25 years.

**Myth: Busted**

**Myth: Hugo Chavez loves dictators like Saddam and Ahmadinejad .**

Most of the reports of this come from the time when Chavez went on a whistle-stop tour of the oil-producing countries. The day after he met Ahmadinejad, he actually met a dictator with a far worse human rights record. [That person was US-favorite, the King of Saudi Arabia.](http://www.images22.com/pics/04/saudi-arabias-king-abdullah-with-hugo-chavez.jpg) The picture elicited almost no response in the US media whatsoever. Chavez has taken a lead in reinvigorating the OPEC cartel, and his visits were laying the groundwork for an agreed reduction in oil drilling, in order to stabilize prices. 

**Myth: Busted**
**Myth: Chavez is an Isolated, Unpopular Leader**

Chavez was the first President of the [Pink Tide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_tide), who see themselves as left-leaning, anti-imperialist politicians. President Lula of Brazil openly backed Chavez, saying [""A victory for Chávez is not just a victory for the people of Venezuela but also a victory for all the people of Latin America … this victory will strike another blow against imperialism.""](www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/03/why-us-dcemonises-venezuelas-democracy). President Correa of Ecuador has called Chavez “a guiding light”( Jones, B. “Hugo” p.420) [Here's a pic](http://paginadoenock.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Kirchner-Evo-Lula-Chavez.jpg) of the Presidents of Bolivia, Brazil and Argentina with Chavez, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/iaubmdb.jpg) what the Argentine public think of him. When asked which country they admired the most, Latin Americans chose [Venezuela by a considerable margin.](http://i.imgur.com/nOaLC5T.png)

**Myth: Busted**

**Bonus Myth: The People are worse off under Chavez**

Chavez instituted a national healthcare system which had performed 225 million consultations by 2007 alone. (Cannon, B.  Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution, p. 93) The number of public doctors has increased by 1200%, from 1628 to 19571 by 2007. 50,000 Venezuelans were given free operations to restore their sight, between 1 and 1.5 million were taught to read for the first time (Jones p. 8) Health expenditure per person [has tripled](http://i.imgur.com/PriJgse.jpg) According to the Gini coefficient, venezuela went from the most unequal country in Latin America to the most equal. An AC Nielsen/Datos report showed that, from 2004-2006, [97.6% of the population grew in income.](http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/2794)

As a student of Latin America, I think Venezuela is one of the most vibrant democracies on Earth, yet the media is representing it as a hellhole. Why is this? [Many](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/01/201312912275351687.html) have [wondered](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/hugo-chavez-proves-you-can-lead-a-progressive-popular-government-that-says-no-to-neoliberalism-8202738.html) Some say it can be explained with [Chomsky and Hermann's Propaganda Model](http://southoftheborderdoc.com/media-distortions-in-latin-america/)

For me, I think it is because they're scared. Of you.  They're scared if people in America knew the truth about what can be achieved in a small country, there would be a dramatic change in American politics overnight. 


Venezuela is certainly not an ideal society by any means, and I'm not even much of a Chavez supporter, but it saddens me to see so many derogatory remarks made about someone who spearheaded change which the vast majority wanted. It also clouds real debate over his failings, as people like me are forced to spend their time correcting and replying to nonsense accusations.

The different personality types cause some of the stylistic differences between the parties.

1) All of these states are ""Right to Work"" states, and assuming they take on a right wing economic agenda, one in which the federal government has no regulatory power, they will also be against a minimum wage, overtime pay, no environmental accountability, maybe even a reversal of child labor laws.

2) This would WORK. Some companies would move their production from China to the de-annexed south. 

3) But with very few taxes, and even lower wages, the revenue from this economic activity would not be enough to sustain a proper education system nor a safety net, with no medicare nor medicaid (plus a lot more sick people due to environmental toxicity) will essentially halt any form of social mobility.

Each one, would work as a federation, and within those federations, it would be a direct function of the United States government. 
They would have presidential elections, congresses, senates, constitutions, and what ever else they want, I don't really care.

This would be far more efficient, because all of these regions tend to share the same voting pattern. By allowing each of these regions to separate in a sense, and make decisions for themselves as a whole, the people would be much happier. The presidents job for each region would be much simpilar due to the fact that he has far less ground to cover and a far smaller government to deal with.

When national decisions need to be made, like war or border disputes or what ever may happen, the presidents of each of the 9 regions will meet to discuss. It is IMPERATIVE that there are 9 regions, so that there is never a tie when the presidents come together to make decisions. 

While I have yet to figure out how things such as defense, international trade, and other key important national decisions would be decided upon; this is something that I think could actually work.

Bassically, instead of one person representing someone from new england and someone from flordia and someone from california, you have one person reperesenting each of them for each section that they are in. Because it is entierly impossible for one man to express the same interests as people from all over the map, but it is possible for states in the same area to be grouped into regions, and to allow thoes regions to elect presidents for themselves. This will be better because each of these regions tend to share the same ideas politically. 
Then, when making decissions for the nation as a whole, each of the elected presidents would get together at the white house, and vote on the decessions they need to make. 

But then again, that would result in a weaker federal system, and would probably result in war between sections. 

But, for me at least, it's always fun thinking about different ways the united states might be governed. ",2012-11-26T17:33:41+00:00

Very high capital gains taxes would stop that by making money from short-term investment strategies very inefficient.

Progressive,post,Annexation,41xv66,Kreslin,Vote for Me,"My Dear Ladies,

As to Jenn's suggestion in the event any of us wins the level of Powerball that was recently awarded, I would hope you would all want to use the proceeds to help with a very special pet project of mine.

There is a presidential election race about to stumble to a start next month, and I feel very strongly that Clinton, Cruz, O'Malley, Trump, Sanders, Rubio, Christie, Fiorina (well, not really), Paul, Bush (Who did I forget? Doesn't matter.) should be honored by having a candidate included in their numbers who would actually be effective at the position for which they are competing. Just. One. Competent. Person. Simple, right?

A simple idea, someone once said, holds, within its simplicity, the truth necessary to challenge all complexities. And complexities are undermined by their very structure, being inherently anti-simple, leaving them defenseless against the truth.

The truth is that this presidential election needs a candidate who can truly represent all of the United States citizens.  One who can promote and protect the rights of both the majority and the minority and bring those (arbitrary) groups together on common ground.

My record on running for elective offices is neither extensive nor galvanizing (1-1; high school). I have never won any Ivy League geek (sic) forensic-fest debate competitions.  I am not a wealthy man. I cannot claim any Hispanic or African or Asian blood; I'm as white as they come. I did attend Episcopal church for the first 20 years of my life, but it didn't stick. I am a quiet but persuasive atheist. My wife and I sleep with three dogs. I never finished college, but unlike many of my friends who did, I have never stopped learning.

And now I find this great country faced with an election defined by today's idea of relevant politicians: farcical caricatures of life-size puppets whose strings are tightly held by special interests as well as their own manipulative egos; and whose limbs walk and wave, assisted by flapping mouths and bobbing heads; while their eyes, narrowed and slitted, seek in the weakness and apathy of their constituents' entropy a foothold, a beachhead, an annexation of their will and wish.

So why in the world would you not want me to be your president?  I'm the guy who will save our country by bringing the Constitution of the United States into the 21st Century. Just because a bunch of rich, old, male, white, well-educated (for the 18th century; not sure how well they'd do on our modern measures of education), elitist, racist, monotheistic (for the most part) misogynists wrote down a few quick outlines of a government doesn't mean they got it right the first time.  In fact, they knew the original was shit, so they almost immediately added some switcharoonies, whoops-forgot-about-thats, never-minds, and strike-thats.........also called the Bill of Rights.

Not to worry, though; later generations felt no qualms in rogering the Constitution a bit more, for outlawing slavery, for temperance, then for drinking, to throw out the outlandish restrictions of the original against women voting, to limit the number of terms to which a president may be elected, and many other sensible, practical measures the ""brilliant"" founding fathers totally derped on. 

The Constitution was, after all, written nearly 240 years ago, when the world was very, very different.  People were very different.  (Even beer was different.)

So why should we expect a 240-year-old document written by 18th century white male aristocrats and wealthy merchants (in the context of them essentially dividing the spoils of the New World) to be the most relevant piece of American literature to advise us today on our modern government?  To carry that banner seems naive at best, stubbornly ignorant at worst. (Yes, I'm looking at you, Justice Scalia.)

So....Vote for me. I have fantastic organizational skills, a heart of gold, a silver tongue, charm to spare, an authority glare taught me by my high school teacher wife, and a big, bald head. I don't play golf, I don't smoke, I do drink, I am a fantastic cook, and I never miss deadlines.  I'm on time, on message, on fleek, on board, on the air, on the way, and on track.  

I will call for a Day of Constitutional Attention (DCA), for all residents of our great nation, on the last day of every month, when we all will meet in groups, large and small, and talk to each other about the relevance and/or irrelevance of the constitution today in relation to some of its dated proscriptions and prescriptions.

After a year of DCAs, I will encourage the leaders of Congress to call a Constitutional Convention so that we may write a NEW constitution that more accurately and effectively represents today's requirements and challenges, in order that we may carefully define the purpose and improve the function of a modern U.S. government.  

Respect for tradition is a great American value.  But that same respect, allowed to atrophy in its quiescent disregard for the passage of time, can become an impediment to progress and, indeed, to all change. We cannot allow the progress of our modern people to be controlled by the two-and-a-half-century-old ideas of wealthy white men who, though they are to be admired for their bravery and intelligence, simply were not braver or more intelligent than the best of us today.

Wake up.  Vote for me. Let's do this.

Hi Everyone!

County  Court Civil Rules Committee will be meeting again in June.  The March  meeting was cancelled for obvious reasons.  Please remember, one of the  major points of discussion involve suppressing false accusations being  made in Civil Court to bypass criminal rules and procedures.

Basically what's been going on in Colorado is an influx of people like Landlords, Collections Agencies and Family/Neighbors filing revenge claims in Civil Court with Criminal Accusations attached to harass or extort their target.  Colorado Supreme Court has been discussing it since last September (you can find the minutes of their meetings in the link below) and are getting ready to change how Civil Checks work.  This is a big deal and they are asking people for their input.

I do not believe this is a conservative or liberal issue, I believe it is an everybody issue.

I  am asking all of you to write a letter requesting swift action to the  rules change that will allow an accused person to suppress dismissed  allegations.  For those who don't know what's going on in Colorado,  here's a basic summary:

Landlords,  Collections Agencies, Neighbors, Family and Co Workers are using civil  laws designed to protect victims to file false claims of criminal acts  while bypassing the criminal justice system (this includes Protection  Orders and other Red Flag type laws).  They can then drop the  accusations before an evidentiary hearing to prevent the accused from  providing proof of innocence, it also allows the accuser to make a  verbal accusation without evidence of wrongdoing.The Judge then vacates  but without prejudice, allowing the accused to bring the accusation up  again if a new event happens.  This legitimizes the first accusation,  even if no evidence was provided, despite sections of the law that  prohibit an accusation from being used as evidence of  wrongdoing.Collections Agencies are even more suited to abusing the law,  because all they have to do is claim they were threatened when  presenting the accused with a demand.  They can directly then garnish  the wages.  We now have a law against surprise billing, but it still  doesn't help those who have been falsely accused of a violent act in  court by Collections Agencies.

The  Colorado Civil Rules committee can be found here, along with a link to  minutes of their meetings.  I believe they first started discussing the  issues at play in September.  


(Apparently I can't post a link right now I have to post the thread first)  


So what is their solution?  Their solution is to officially add District Court Rules 121 p 1-5 to the County Court System.  This is a decent solution but there are holes to this.  Maybe I'm wrong, maybe you support this, which is cool, LET THEM KNOW WHAT YOU SUPPORT!

I am personally advocating for an AUTOMATED PROCESS.

The benefits of an automated process over a Judicial Discretionary Process are:

1. Less stress on the court system.
2. Significantly  reduced legal fees.  Since minorities and the  impoverished are  directly affected by this, reduced legal fees are a  major point.
3. County  Court Judges have already expressed a desire to err on the  side of  caution far too much, so much so it's created the problem we are  facing  today.
4. More  expedient.  The current Rule 121 p 1-5 system requires a  judge to  weigh the pros and cons, and it can take weeks or months before  an  answer is received.
5. Out  of state people who have been maliciously targeted will need  an  automated system to alleviate the extreme burden of a prolonged  hearing  process.

The automated process would require these things:

1. An independent investigation by a 3rd party proving there is no evidence of wrongdoing
2. The accusation is dropped or dismissed
3. support of the original petitioner to be considered in place of one or both of the above two

If  those conditions are met then the accusation is sealed.  If there  was  no wrong doing, then it is expunged after the statute of limitations   for the original accusation is up.

IN  EITHER CASE, I FULLY support ANY rule change the CRC chooses to make.   If they stick with expanding District Court Rule 121 p 1-5, then we  should still support it because it's better than nothing.  PLEASE  contact them and give your support for an expedient decision!

Written/mailed  letters (not email, letters) are more beneficial than  phone calls.  I  don't even think they accept emails.  Justice Richard  Gabriel is in  charge of the Civil Rules Committee.  Please be  respectful, not  demanding.",2020-04-24T22:30:48+00:00

Progressive,post,Two-state solution,1amht9,ravia,An open appeal to President Obama to send out troops to a site of pressing need.,"Dear Mr. President,

I am an advocate of nonviolence. I have been arrested in protest of US military activities. Yet I am asking that you take initiative and send the military forces of the United States to a situation of urgent need and dreadful calamity. I am asking you to consider using your executive powers to launch an unprecedented initiative in devoting thousands of military personnel to engage an enemy whose strength and stealth may be one of the most formidable opponents the great country of the United States of America has ever felt the urgent need to stay, quell and ultimately vanquish.

I am referring to the backlogue of Veterans Administration cases. From 500 days wait times for disability claims, to offices in which the sheer quantity of paper work is causing structural instability in the buildings in which form upon form piles up, to the dreadful cases of the completion of claim processes occurring after the deaths of applicants, the situation is appalling. 

I don't need to remind you of the inherent dignity and sacrifice of the US armed forces, however one stands on given wars or war itself. I do need to ask, however, whether the present solutions are not in fact too little, too late. For they will indeed be inadequate for every veteran who is not processed in a timely manner, whether the target date of 2015 for a 5 month waiting period -- itself quite long -- is met or not. 

I am asking that you deploy troops, real troops, unarmed and ready to move papers, read them, file forms, enter data, hand carry, visit needing (and often homeless) veterans; to expedite with the same degree of cut-through-the-crap that enabled the landing at Normandy and Operation Desert Storm. 

I would suggest that you kill two birds with one stone by additionally creating platoons for soldiers at risk for PTSD or who are suffering from it, as I believe that a replication of full out platoon life as a stateside enterprise may be a good therapy for soldiers suffering from PTSD. Whether this additional suggestion is of use or no, the situation of the treatment of veterans fully calls, I believe, for nothing less than the actual deployment of troops. Such an action would be unprecedented, an act of real and necessary initiative. It would bespeak a sober reckoning with the facts as well as a competent and bold action of real humanity.

The monster of this bureaucratic lethargy, backlogue, ancient procedure and strange complacency must be met with resolute and real deployment, however expensive. If it is not allowed by statute, then I challenge you to put it as a referendum of some kind to congress and to the American people. 

Deploy the United States Military stateside in the Veterans Administration system to expedite the horrendous backlogue of cases. Stop the quiet, atrocious and even deadly incompetence and lack of resources that have besmirched the United States in her treatment of her military heroes. ",2013-03-19T22:49:34+00:00
Progressive,post,Two-state solution,5dmigb,Panprometheus,A Declaration of Emergency and Appropriate Measures,"Back when obama was running and then won, I had this startlingly absurd twilight zone sensation, of wanting so much on the one hand to support him, but knowing that he simply wasn't going to pull off a revolution.

His rhetoric and ideas were advanced certainly, but couched in the end in populist and leftist ideology. His desire to bridge the gap and be the middle and work things out was honorable- but all the right would do is walk all over him and abuse him for it. His ideas were advanced, but certainly not solutions to the issues. I knew it was going to go bad, and never pan out.

So i tried. REALLY HARD. To get some kind of social movement going to inform obama and the dems. To bring science back into the mix, and come up with sane and lucid science solutions to the problems, instead of what actually happened.

What actually happened is that obama with all the best intentions set up a cabinet based on being nice to the political hacks of the world. Not a cabinet with any actual scientists in it. Not that he should be singled out for doing what the bushes did in spades before him, but the effect was predictable and played through his presidency. Time and time again the half solutions and half answers and half sense of an administration running in scientific ignorance made a good pass at a better possible world but failed truly to lock it in for being out of touch with reality. Informed by political hacks and lobbyists, but not actual informed science, the president put forth things like ""obamacare"". Truly a living testament to the middle path of a great and magnificent compromiser, ultimately written by the republicans and the insurance companies and then pinned to obamas back. 

Many of the new deals were better, but many of them worse. The boon of mandatory insurance for instance made a nice windfall for insurance companies. Over all obama care is working, its better than what existed before it, but what should we have fought for and won for all that trouble? Something half shady which is bound to be replaced and repealed? 

He could of and should have done better, and it could have and should have been written by game theorists and medical professionals, not insurance agencies.

It could have been even single payer. OR at least something without 20 fatal flaws in it halfway to single payer.

This is the pattern. Obama gets his information from who? Lobbyists. Not scientists.

And so the outcome is that he doesn't make a big enough dent in the lives of ordinary people for them to notice. They are objectively better off because of him, but the proles can't see cause and effect, or how obama saved them from 90 percent of the pain that bush would have otherwise caused them.

Well, here we are. Back then I predicted this. I told everyone that if obama didn't pull it together a whole lot better than he was that he would end tragically giving the game back to the republicans, and then they'd lite civilization on fire. And you all booed me and hissed me and shushed me and snitted at me and the general public would have none of that. I worked thousands of hours to provide the solutions the obama admin needed to do better. And nobody cared, and nobody listened; And now here we are. Right where i feared and predicted we would end.

So now we face those consequences, but oddly the real game is the same. Not the game of the body politic. Not the game of partisan bickering. Not the game of the hegelian dialectic. But the game of revolution. 

Revolution (in any sane civil sense of the word) Comes at the end of a change of social modality and social reality, in which we finally do learn to collaborate, finally do learn to seek knowledge and scientific truth together, and finally do learn to operate as open source think tanks- working on and solving together the high order problems of the world.

And THAT PROCESS, not two political parties and a hegelian dialectic is what democracy actually is. The positions and ideas of candidates? Why should anyone care? Thats not democracy, its an electoral ideological imperialism, in which your candidate makes up their minds what to do about the problems of the world, and everyone else can just F off or Sign on. Thats not democracy.

Democracy would be we the people working on the problems, one issue and one problem at a time, and public servants dedicating themselves to move that public agenda- not their own.

There is still time to save our nation from the fire and doom and gloom, but only realistically if we have that revolution. The only chance we have now for holding civilization together realistically is to take back the power from government and guide and control our public servants as a wakened and lucid democracy.

to this end we should be immediately creating a new platform together. We should be walking through the issues and asking ourselves what SCIENCE has to say about them. This is key. Because what we are used to is what IDEOLOGY has to say about the problem. Right ideology, left ideology, dem ideology, republican ideology... ETC. And that is bad for us, because ideology is detached from cause and effect, its detached from actual science understanding, its detached from reality.

So its time for the revolution to start. the revolution consists to start of 101 threads on the 101 issues, and the creation of an initial political platform of a progressive political party. This progressive party should be grounded in science and logic and it should operate via some facsimile of genuine democracy- open source, direct democracy- on the internet. Working on and solving civilizations problems . For real, instead of faking it.

That kind of process can be viral, and it can in the end win over dem voters and republican voters who will see the stark difference between mere ideological non solutions, and serious science centered lucid rational problem solving process.

The work involved is steep, but not for a large number of people. A real revolution is by definition composed of that work, because a fake revolution by definition doesn't do the work and like gravity , society falls back to the energy state its going to rest on top of.

All these failed social movements and revolutions immediately fail to grasp that the currency of a valid revolution is the solutions it has to 1001 high order problems. Not its complaints about other political or social agencies or institutions.

We have to swim to a lucid and science centered understanding of reality and solve our problems with science instead of ideology. If we do that, it can go viral, and it can overpower the other course of history we are otherwise on.

If we fail to do that, gollum just won the election, and this is going to go very badly from here on out.

Every single one of his policy proposals is in cause and effect terms realistically a credible existentialist threat to our country. That wall for instance? a trillion dollar expense which could easily bankrupt the country, and which by definition has NO VALUE at all in keeping people out. Theres a stone age invention we call LADDERS. (shhhh, don't tell the mexicans.) And etc, over, under, around, on boats... The illegals will find a way in. The  wall won't slow them down any longer than 15 or 20 minutes.

So its useless, it spends huge money, and it more importantly steals vast economic resources including labor pools out to nowhere in the middle of the dessert somewhere.

Whats the real cause and effect of all that? A mere escalation of the border problem, trillions of dollars wasted, vast resources esp human resources camped out at the border... 

What does that do to us economically? What does it do to our internal relationship with illegal aliens, who are making it here anyhow? With mexicans and latinos generally speaking? 

Obviously thats a pretty bad scene when you stop and think about it, and the consequences of it. And thats just one proposal. Walk through any one of dons proposals and you realize they are all of them civilization nuking non solutions to the problems. 

That is where we are. If we fail to act, we can expect civilization to burn. If we act smartly, this can finally be the fire under the arse of the general population to have the revolution we have otherwise stalled out on for 50 years.

Well, long bit, I will leave it there and hope for people to get involved and ask questions.

Thanks in advance for joining the revolution!

This is my response to his agenda-driven ""questionnaire"".","I urge my fellow Redditors (particularly my fellow progressives!) to act when they are outraged at politics.  Contact your elected officials if they offend you with their actions, votes, ignorance, or blindness to real issues.  My voice alone may not make a difference with these well-lobbied party ""yes men"", but if enough of us speak out, it can make a difference.  Look at what has happened with SOPA/PIPA lately.

My representative in Congress sent me short questionnaire, which was clearly targeted to his strong right wing base here.  Frankly I don't know much why he bothered, other than it let's him honestly say, ""*What I'm hearing from the people is...*""

When you get something like this from an elected official, give them your opinion, but if you find offense give them a piece of your mind too.

Here's [a link to his leading and agenda-driven ""questionnaire""](https://iqs3.solutions.lmit.com/iqextranet/EsurveyForm.aspx?__cid=FL04AC&__sid=100005&__crop=14155.3808720.2496168.7114332)  

Here's my reply:

════════════════════════════════════════════════

Dear Rep. Crenshaw:

I just completed your ""Fourth Congressional District e-Questionnaire"" and wanted to address it further.  This is likely going to end up in a virtual trashcan full of e-mails labeled something like, ""dissatisfied constituents that pose no threat, or who aren't high paying lobbyists"".  But I'll still exercise my right as your boss, to tell you what I think of your questionnaire.

You ostensibly seek the input of your constituents, yet your questionnaire is blatantly agenda driven without regard to discovering what your constituents' opinions really are.  I say this because your questions are clearly phrased to elicit a response supportive of your right wing perspective.  

For example, rather than simply asking if your constituents would support a reduction in military spending, you ""lead the witness"" by first mentioning our brave service members fighting the ""War on Terror... 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week...""  This serves no other purpose than to inject emotion into the question, and to position the issue so that anyone who supports cutting military spending seems to be opposed to our women and men in uniform.

You also phrase your questions regarding Social Security as if it is a program in danger of insolvency.  I'm not entirely sure but it also seems to me as if you're trying to frame Social Security as some sort of out of control federal spending program adding to our debt.  It is not.  Social Security hasn't added a penny to our debt!  It could easily be funded for many many years beyond 2037 by simply lifting the ridiculous Social Security ""Tax Cap"", which shifts an unfair burden of the expense onto the shoulders of the middle class and away from your rich friends.  Rather than this simple solution, instead you propose raising the eligibility age.  You're wealthy - you will never rely on Social Security to feed you, but others are not as well off and depend on it.  Yet you'd rather make it harder to collect than simply make the Social Security tax apply fairly.

Lastly, Mr. Crenshaw, your ""fair tax"" gem, is simply yet another way the 1% in Washington would rather shift the tax burden onto the bottom portion of the 99%.  If you truly believe a consumption tax is fair to everyone, you need take two seconds to do an internet search to find out why it is EXTREMELY unfair to the working class.  But you don't care.  I'm sorry but you and I both know that's the case.  As an elected official there's no way you could exist in such a bubble as to think that a national sales tax is a ""fair"" income tax alternative.  You know why it's unfair to the poor and middle class but there's no way you'll ever admit it.

I answered your questionnaire and, as I said above, I expect my response (and this e-mail) to be lumped in with the few others like it.  As Republican you are fortunate to be representing a very right wing district in a moderately right wing state.  Despite your near invisibility in representing the fourth district (missed votes, etc.), the average Republican here in Jacksonville will gladly and blindly support you based simply on the ""R"" next to your name and the leading agenda driven questions you ask in your questionnaire.  

My opinion won't count with you and this e-mail serves no purpose beyond a cathartic rant for me, but know this:  I WILL be voting against you and I WILL do all I can to educate my fellow citizens in the Fourth District about you.

Progressive,post,Two-state solution,ipy5f,jewbles,response to mom's forwarded email,"She sent me [one](http://snopes.com/politics/soapbox/proportions.asp) that's been around since 2009 and asked me what I think about it.  She's not a Beck fan but I think her sister is so she knows the name.  My response:

The best summary I can think of is a quote from Abraham Lincoln: “Don't believe everything you read on the Internet.”  This is probably doubly true for emails including ""Fwd"" in the subject line.
 
David Kaiser is a real and well-regarded historian but he only wrote the first two sentences of what is attributed to him here.  He has definitively stated that the text of the email is, in many ways, the opposite of his views.
 
And mine as well.  I’m proud to call myself a liberal even though it’s so often flung around as an insult.  I’d be surprised if I’m not the most liberal member of our extended family or [my wife's].  In fact, I’m everything that people like Glen Beck hate.
 
It may or may not surprise you that I’m a proud and vehement supporter of gay rights, including marriage and parenting.  Discrimination and the denial of equality are among the vilest and most saddening wrongs that my generation will eventually set right.  We’ll do it because 40 years ago some extremely brave individuals stood up and said, “This is who we are.”  They made it easier for other to do the same, to be “out” and not hide in fear and shame of what their heart tells them to do.  Because of these brave people, my generation has known gay people.  We’ve befriended them and had long conversations where they honestly answer our stupid questions like, “When did you know you’re gay?” with the equally stupid (yet profound) “When did you know you’re straight?”  It’s not something I know, it’s who I am.  And they are who they are.  I also find it laughable that “family values” politicians can, with a straight face, deny a loving couple the opportunity to adopt a child.  Every reputable study I’ve heard of has found that children of same-sex parents are no better or worse from those of opposite-sex parents.  (More on “experts” later.)
 
I think the Federal Reserve is far from perfect, but it is also far from having “little or no real oversight by anyone.”  Its members are appointed by the president, subject to approval by the Senate and can be impeached.  Even with the several economics courses I have had, I have trouble wrapping my head around the whole thing.  (If you want more information, This American Life has done several excellent programs on the subject, I'll find the links.)  I often hear those like Ron Paul saying we should return to a “gold standard” because it has a known value and is “real money.”  My response is that the economic system that has developed in the world is absurdly complex.  I understand that Ron Paul is a fine obstetrician and I’ve agreed with him on a few political topics, but I prefer to trust someone with a PhD in economics and a Nobel Prize in economics with our economy.
 
This brings me to the next part, the paragraph on education.  Why are we surprised that our nation is foundering in education when we treat “experts” with such derision.  The PhD/Nobel laureate example above is Peter Diamond.  President Obama nominated him to the Federal Reserve board because he is an expert on unemployment and job-creation.  Diamond recently withdrew his nomination because one senator from Alabama feels that he lacks experience.  The senator’s own pre-political experience that allows him to sit in judgment of Diamond?  City prosecutor of Tuscaloosa for eight years.  Federal magistrate for four.  Assistant state attorney general for two.
 
I hear Michelle Bachmann (whose presidential prospects truly and whole-heartedly frighten me) say that we should teach Biblical creation alongside Darwinian evolution because there is a controversy about which is right and she doesn’t “believe” in evolution which, after all, is only a theory.  There is no controversy among the scientific community.  It does not matter what she believes.  It is a scientific theory which is supported by mountains of evidence.  Her disregard for those who have dedicated their lives to the study of science and become “experts” is echoed throughout the conservative community and media.  If we’re unwilling to respect the end result of years and decades and centuries of education, how can we expect our children to respect the education itself?  (The same argument can be made for climate change science and other topics.)
 
I would rather vote for an intellectual person with no personal skills than a charming and folksy candidate.  I don’t care if the person running the country is an egghead whom 87% of Americans wouldn’t like to share a beer with.  I want someone that has more than a cursory knowledge of economics and Constitutional law.  I want someone who doesn’t force their beliefs down the throats of people who are getting along perfectly well.  I want someone who is willing to admit that they don’t know everything, weigh the evidence and opinions of experts, and make a rational with no mention of feelings or faith.
 
ACORN was in no way a Marxist institution.  They simply tried to register people to vote and help impoverished citizens lift themselves up and create better lives for their children.  How much more American can you get?  Like many organizations, they had some troubles, but the most publicized one was entirely manufactured.  The video of an ACORN representative offering business advice to a pimp (undercover activist James O’Keefe) and suggesting ways to commit tax fraud was the equivalent of a photoshopped picture.  Admittedly, it was “experts” who say the video is a fraud.  ;O)
 
As for ACORN’s “voter fraud,” this is a blatant misrepresentation of facts intended to turn public support against the organization.  The truth is that one way ACORN helped the impoverished was to offer them jobs.  ACORN would pay minimum wage for a person to collect voter registrations.  Instead of actually working, a handful of people would submit fake registrations.  Though disturbing, there was never really a chance of these fake voters casting ballots in an election.
 
Sarah Palin comes next in the email.  I won’t even discuss the clown after the “death panels” crap she inflicted on this nation.
 
As for Obama’s change, there hasn’t really been any.  He staffed the White House with former lobbyists, has not closed the prison camp at Guantanamo (the most anti-American institution ever created in the name of patriotism), and continued the warrantless wiretap program in clear and blatant violation of the Fourth Amendment.  He doesn’t even support gay marriage.
 
I’m so disgusted by Nazi comparisons (from both sides) that I might be sick.  I despise most of George W. Bush’s policies and administration.  He is unintelligent, anti-intellectual, and surrounded himself with advisors who failed to challenge his view of the world.  He may be a war criminal, but I’ve also been told that all war is a crime.  What he and Barack Obama are not is anything close to Hitler. 
 
Hitler came to power under what can only be described as horrific times.  Germany after World War I was an economic wasteland.  The governments of France, Britain, etc. imposed reparations on Germany, basically making the losers pay the victors for the bullets, bombs, and poison gas used.  To do so, German simply printed a whole lot of money and said, “Here you go!”  The result was hyper-inflation.  Imagine waking up and milk costing $4 a gallon.  By lunch time it’s $50 and then $100 that night.  Everyone would be looking for a solution.  It’s no coincident that the planned extermination of Jews, blacks, homosexuals, gypsies, and communists was referred to as “the final solution” by the German high command.
 
Hitler blamed those listed above as secretly conspiring to keep Germany from rising to its rightful place as the dominant nation of the world.  First he rounded them up into ghettoes.  His troops went around and gathered up people considered “different” and hauled them off to separate, walled-off sections of the nation.  If, in the process, they happened to kill a few…who would care?  You know the rest, the concentration camps and all.
 
The key thing to take away is that Hitler targeted minorities, those “different” from their neighbors.  He told the majority that the minority was responsible and a scapegoat was born.
 
When I listen to the rhetoric of our current political environment, it’s certainly not Obama saying, “Look at those atheists / gays / blacks / Mexicans / other minority.  They’re different from us and they’re ruining our nation.”  It’s Glen Beck, Bill O’Reilly, and Pat Robertson.  It’s Rick Santorum, Sarah Palin, and Michele Bachmann.  I am not saying they are comparable to Hitler or that there aren't similar idiots on the left.  I'm saying there’s a lot more hate in their speech than in Obama’s and their voices are much louder.
 
The other bit about Hitler which no president has ever been able to match is that he threw away his country’s constitution and set himself up to rule for life.  If Obama or any other president tries to hang around after the constitutionally limited ten years, you can rest assured that my voice will be among the loudest protesting.

Hope that helps.  Feel free to share this with anyone else who got the original email.  I'm proud of my views on the topics and always happy to correct misinformation.  And here's a [puppy](http://i.imgur.com/ImGWv.jpg).  :OD

Republican,post,Israel,nefeq1,RedBaronsBrother,Here's the excuse the Palestinians used to attack Israel,"Here's the timeline: 

1. 1875: **Jews buy Sheikh Jarrah from Arabs**. Ownership of it changes a couple of times till present days, but always between Jews. Jews live in Sheikh Jarrah from 1875 to 1948.

2. 1948: Jordan, through war, conquers Sheikh Jarrah. Forcefully evicts all Jews. Palestinians move in in property that doesn't belong to them.

3. 1967: Israel, through war, conquers back Sheikh Jarrah. Israel does NOT chase out all Palestinians who are squatting in Jewish-owned land. 

4. 1982: after a legal battle, an Israeli court decides that if Palestinians want to live in Sheikh Jarrah, they have to pay rent to the rightful owners. The Palestinians living in Sheikh Jarrah agree to this. 

2021: in nearly 40 years, the Palestinians have paid NOTHING to what they agreed with the sentence of 1982. Not only that, but they also illegally built properties in Sheikh Jarrah that they then rented out to other Palestinians (!!!). 

So what did the owners do? Move to have them evicted, because 73 years of mooching (= since Palestinians were made to move in, courtesy of the Jordanians) is way more than enough. 

That in return caused riots with Molotov cocktails and stones thrown against Police and Army. The rioters then took refuge in Al-Aqsa mosque (where they had stockpiled the stones and Molotovs) and Israeli forces went to get them in there, because you just can't try to stone and/or burn alive people and then take refuge in a mosque and say you can't touch me in here. 

Now the Israeli forces entering in Al-Aqsa gave Hamas the excuse to shoot thousands of rockets indiscriminately into Israel. They don't care if they hit civilians: their objective is the destruction of Israel and all its citizens. 

Lastly, the Israeli ANSWERED the rocket barrage with air strikes. They also give 1-hour warnings before they attack, but it is better for Hamas to have civilians die, so that uneducated, superficial people like you can go around in the internet virtue-signaling with their manufactured outrage.

People are morons.  Practically the same hard right Republicans:

* Supported the Iraq war, which cost the US $3 T, 15,000 Americans dying, and billions of pain and suffering in medical costs, PTSD.  None of the money and costs were recouped.
* Want to defund / cancel support for Ukraine, which will cost \~$120 B and the money can be recouped from frozen Russian assets and there is minimal loss of any American life.  The financial and human cost is practically nothing compared to almost any other conflict the US has been involved in during the last 100 years.  The Ukranians are doing all the human sacrificing.

And in the Ukraine situation, they are totally depleting Russia's military capability and devastating a major geopolitical foe.  The war is devastating to Russia both to its military and financially.

They take advantage of Americans' inability to reason, think for themselves, and independently conduct in-depth research. Go forth and break the conditioning with truth","Blm is a Marxist organization whose primary purpose is not to help black lives, but to bring about a communism society in America. One of the cofounders said that she and another cofounder were “trained Marxists.” https://imgur.com/gallery/0vQNK0K Demonstrating just how far left they are, another cofounder wrote an article on a Venezuelan news website in which she called out Bernie Sanders for calling Hugo Chavez a dictator. https://imgur.com/gallery/vK367Kv Even worse, Susan Rosenburg sits on the Board of Directors of blm. Susan has taken part in communist organizations in America and was arrested in 1984 and sentenced to 58 years in prison on weapons and explosives charges. She was also sought as an accomplice to a couple of bombings. She is free now because her sentence was commuted by Bill clinton. http://archive.is/0F5T0 The Black Lives Matter website itself says that one of its goals is to disrupt the nuclear family, one of the stated goals found within the Communist Manifesto. https://imgur.com/gallery/h2pW1J9 This alone shows just how little the group cares for black lives. One of the most devastating things to have hit black America in the latter half of the 20th century has been the destruction of the nuclear family.

Single motherhood makes children much more likely to live in poverty and commit crimes. Not attacking single mothers, but the trend is real. Over 70% of African-Americans are born to single mothers. This is the major problem facing the community. Black fathers have to begin caring for the women they impregnate and the children they bear, who once abandoned by their fathers, are forced into a life of poverty. A nuclear family with a father in the home makes a boatload of difference. Prior to the mid-1960s, nearly all children were born to married couples, including black children. This phenomenon was reversed once the progressive War on Poverty began. The welfare state incentivized single motherhood as it provided mothers with welfare benefits if there was no man in the house. https://www.heritage.org/welfare/report/how-welfare-undermines-marriage-and-what-do-about-it Additionally, the vast majority of African-Americans that are murdered in America are killed by other blacks. This is not to say that we should ignore police brutality, as that should be addressed as well. Police who commit murder against unarmed civilians should be punished and police reform should be enacted. However, the group is spreading the false narrative that police and racism are the most dangerous things facing black America. This is false. As mentioned previously, the vast majority of African-Americans who are killed are killed by other blacks, not whites. We have seen this trend worsen with blm’s calls to defund the police. Democrat-run cities that have surrendered to these proposals have seen skyrocketing crime rates, including black-on-black crime. https://imgur.com/gallery/nrpWWAu https://imgur.com/gallery/r7Wioos There was an 8-year old girl in Atlanta who was shot by an armed blm protestor. https://imgur.com/gallery/8hJhwJV . This is but one of many instances of the black-on-black violence that has plagued America. Despite this, blm has not changed its stance on policing. Thus, Davis Dorn, an African-American who was protecting his friend’s pawn shop, was killed by looters. Patrick Underwood, a black police officer, was killed in Oakland. https://archive.vn/pxWsz http://archive.is/hXiqZ https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-3.xls https://archive.vn/UnQcr https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6.xls https://archive.vn/LFW18 Compare that to the number of unarmed blacks killed by cops. Most blacks that are killed by the police are actually armed. https://imgur.com/gallery/gdN68hk http://archive.vn/JDNxE#selection-2511.0-2528.0 https://imgur.com/gallery/wAZyQrF More evidence that blm’s main goal is not helping blacks, but overthrowing the US for a communist society is the fact that they have continuously defaced statues important to American history. They have even defaced statues of abolitionists and Union soldiers. One of the main goals found in the Communist Manifesto is the destruction of the nuclear family, religion, and national identity in order to make way for a communist society. This seems to be what blm is attempting. Why else would they deface the statue of anti-slavery poet Greenleef Whittier? https://imgur.com/gallery/LHUpOLa They also toppled the statue of a Norwegian immigrant and abolitionist who served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. http://archive.is/ELeRu. They defaced a statue of Abraham Lincoln in London https://imgur.com/gallery/irSbE8j and The Colorado State Capitol Khachkar memorial to the Armenian Genocide http://archive.is/h5yOz. As we see, they are deliberately trying to destroy the memory of Western Civilization, just as the Communist Manifesto calls for. These aren’t isolated events. Rioters in Philly deface a statue of Matthias Baldwin, an early abolitionist who fought against slavery. https://imgur.com/gallery/dqq0zod. They vandalized the Memorial to the Victims of Communism in DC https://imgur.com/gallery/R5JQ8JL as well as the DC statue of Tadeusz Kościuszko, who fought for the rights of minorities. In his will, he donated a portion of his estate to free slaves belonging to Thomas Jefferson. He also bequeathed sums for the education of freed slaves. https://imgur.com/gallery/ynAeuXY . They also defaced the Memorial to Vietnam Veterans, many of whom were African-Americans. A statue defaced with the acronym “BLM” along with the communist hammer and sickle symbol. https://imgur.com/a/h8eeCtd

Furthermore, the majority of interracial crimes in America are not committed by whites, but by blacks. The groups is spreading the narrative the African-Americans are overly policed. However, black men, who make up around 6.5% of the population, commit over 50% of the violent crimes. I recommend you watch videos by Thomas Sowell, Larry Elder, and Brandon Tatum. I also recommend you search up Terry Crews’ videos and tweets. They are all African-Americans who give an alternative perspective to that given by blm activists. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFqVNPwsLNo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhy-NvXt0-U https://imgur.com/gallery/eXK6KeG https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv5-mc4U_Zw&t=2s https://imgur.com/a/ABrYTuR https://news.0censor.com/b-l-m-leader-warns-whites/ https://twitter.com/AlwaysActions/status/1269476349384818703 https://imgur.com/a/VUOr4Ea http://archive.vn/LFW18 https://news.yahoo.com/poll-most-black-americans-want-170411177.html https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/empirical_analysis_tables_figures.pdf?mod=article_inline https://youtu.be/-2N2w4d0N0w https://archive.vn/wN3yM http://archive.is/59wbE https://youtu.be/XfsJxkobPXk

It’s ironic that BLM was founded by so-called anti-racist Marxists who perscribe to the gender philosophy. BLM activists continuously denounce the US for the flaws of its founding generation. Yet they themselves never seem to engage in the self-criticism that they want Americans to accept. Marx was a vehement racist and the gender ideology espoused by the BLM organization was created by pedophiles. https://archive.vn/iwwdB

A close look into the history of the Black Lives Matter organization shows that its founders have close ties to communism. Don’t just take it from conservative commentators. Listen to the words of co-founder Patrisse Cullors, who in an interview admitted that she and co-founder Alicia Garza were both “trained Marxists.”https://therealnews.com/pcullors0722blacklives In another interview with Teen Vogue, Cullors admitted to being mentored by Angela Davis. https://archive.is/QGJaA They team up every year to give public speeches. Who is Angela Davis? She is a political activist who ran twice as the Vice President of the Communist Party of America. https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/02/us/hall-at-74-still-seeks-presidency.html

In 1979, Davis went on a trip to the USSR where she was given the Lenin Peace Prize. She expressed her gratitude for the prize “bearing the name of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin here on the very soil where he led the great October Revolution.” http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/45045389d6759defac6845a2f3bdfcea When his party failed to garner substantial traction in its first election, Lenin and his Bolsheviks disbanded the Russian legislature. Lenin then implemented a series of purges. Hundreds of thousands were killed through his Red Terror and dekulakization campaigns. The victims were targeted either because they were convicted of wrongthink or deemed privileged peasants (kulaks). This is the man that Cullor’s mentor praised.

Black Lives Matter’s association with communism does not end there. The US Social forum brands itself as an internationalist movement that seeks to transform America. In one of the group’s Detroit meetings, both Patrice Cullors and Eric Mann were chosen as panelists. http://web.archive.org/web/20120211205206/https:/thestrategycenter.org/transformative-organizing In 1969, Eric Mann became involved with the Weather Underground group, a domestic terrorist group whose goal was “world communism.” https://vault.fbi.gov/Weather%20Underground%20%28Weathermen%29/Weather%20Underground%20%28Weathermen%29%20Part%201%20of%206/view They wanted to create “two, three, many Vietnams” through which the U.S. would be “defeated and destroyed in the process.”

While America fought communism abroad, they sought to destabilize the U.S. from within. The way they would achieve this goal was to create chaos and instability at home. This is what led to Eric Mann’s imprisonment in 1969. He and his fellow Weather Underground comrades rioted at Harvard where Mann was arrested for assault and destroying property. https://archive.vn/DU8je

Susan Rosenburg, a convicted terrorist, served as Vice Chair on the Board of Directors for Black Lives Matter’s fundraising organization, Thousand Currents. https://web.archive.org/web/20200616222408/https:/thousandcurrents.org/board-of-directors/ In the 1980s, Susan Rosenberg took part in the May 19th Communist Organization, whose goal was to “overthrow the U.S. government through armed struggle and use of violence.” https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/120257NCJRS.pdf Carrying out the organization’s stated goals, Susan Rosenberg was arrested in 1984 for “possession of a huge amount of explosives and numerous weapons.” She had already been on the run for a number of years for her role in previous robberies and murders. As serious as her crimes were, she was released after Bill Clinton commuted her sentence in 2001. This same group was responsible for bombings at multiple locations between 1983 and 1985, including military installations, the Capitol, and the New York Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/06/us/3-radicals-agree-to-plead-guilty-in-bombing-case.html

Demonstrating just how far left they are, Opal Tometi, co-founder of the Black Lives Matter Network, wrote an article on a Venezuelan news website in which she admonished Bernie Sanders for branding Hugo Chavez a dictator. https://archive.vn/hw84X She also took a picture of herself alongside Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro. For being an organization that claims to stand against police brutality, Opal had no qualms about embracing a dictator whose own police forces have murdered and tortured thousands of civilians. The year before the picture was taken, protestors were killed by the regime and the UN documented over 100 cases of torture in less than a year. Praise of communist dictators continues. In 2016, Black Lives Matter released a eulogy for Fidel Castro after his death. https://archive.is/UdW9C Castro’s regime had previously engaged in extrajudicial killings and torture. He also persecuted Christianity, which most African-Americans adhere to. Communists and socialists escape all criticism, no matter how egregious their crimes or how similar those crimes are to the perceived injustices they claim to fight against in the U.S. An organization that embraces Marxism and violent criminal regimes is not a group that America should embrace.

Clues regarding the extent to which BLM supports Marxism are abound. Their own website references the word “comrade” multiple times and the raised fist that they have adopted onto their flag was first used by the Communist Party of Germany. It has been a popular symbol amongst communists ever since. The Black Lives Matter website itself states that one of its goals is to disrupt the nuclear family, one of the objectives found within the Communist Manifesto.

BLM is Marxist not only in theory, but in practice as well. The Communist Manifesto calls for the destruction of religion and national identity in order to make way for a communist society. Trained Marxists around the world have sought to make good on this by destroying all evidence of the past, especially statues and religious icons. They have done so in Mao’s Cultural Revolution as well as in Cambodia under Pol Pot. In this regard, Black Lives Matter is no different. https://imgur.com/gallery/HsrEC1u https://imgur.com/gallery/sZkCkdP https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNTd0dydfE4

Some supporters claim that BLM has only destroyed Confederate statues. This is untrue as they have continuously defaced statues depicting abolitionist figures in American history. They defaced the statue of anti-slavery poet Greenleef Whittier. They toppled the Wisconsin statue of a Norwegian immigrant and abolitionist who served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. They defaced The Colorado State Capitol Khachkar memorial to the Armenian Genocide. Rioters in Philly defaced a statue of Matthias Baldwin, an early abolitionist who fought against slavery. BLM vandalized the Memorial to the Victims of Communism in DC and took pictures of themselves flipping off the statue. They are deliberately trying to destroy the memory of Western Civilization, just as the Communist Manifesto calls for.

Republican,post,Two-state solution,18ewfch,Head_Estate_3944,Arizona 's Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs demands $512 millions reimbursement from Biden in scathing letter accusing him of failure to secure southern border,"Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, has accused President Joe Biden of failing to secure the southern border, and is seeking half a billion dollars in federal reimbursement for the state's spending on the crisis.

In a letter on Friday, which Hobbs released publicly, the governor requested more than $512 million in federal funds to reimburse state spending on illegal alien transport, drug interdiction, and law enforcement 'due to the federal government's failure to secure our border.'

It comes after Customs and Border Protection encounters with illegal aliens at the southern border reportedly hit a one-day high of 12,000 on Tuesday, including more than 10,200 who were detained illegally entering the US from Mexico between ports of entry.

On Monday, CBP closed the Lukeville border crossing in Arizona indefinitely, in order to surge agents from the crossing to help arrest and process a flood of illegal aliens walking across the border to claim asylum.

The desolate area around the remote crossing has become a global illegal migration route in recent months, with smugglers dropping off illegal foreigners from countries as far flung as Senegal, India and China. 

Most of them are walking into the US west of Lukeville through gaps in the wall, then turn east toward the official border crossing to surrender to the first agents they see to claim asylum, according to the AP.

Hobbs in her letter slammed the closing of the Lukeville crossing, saying it 'has led to an unmitigated humanitarian crisis in the area and has put Arizona's safety and commerce at risk.'

'Our ports of entry are essential to our state and our country's economy, and it is vial that they be properly staffed and resourced to continue to fuel economic growth in the state,' she added.

Hobbs called for National Guard members who are currently on active federal duty be mobilized to assist CBP in manning the Lukeville crossing, so it can be reopened.

The White House and CBP did not immediately respond to requests for comment from DailyMail.com on Saturday morning.

In a statement last week, CBP said it was 'surging all available resources to expeditiously and safely process illegal aliens' and will 'continue to prioritize our border security mission as necessary in response to this evolving situation.' 

The agency blamed the hundreds of people arriving daily around Lukeville on 'smugglers peddling disinformation to prey on vulnerable foreign individuals.' 

Alongside Governor Hobbs, Arizona Senators Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema have slammed the Lukeville closure and demanded better solutions from Biden's administration.

'This is an an unacceptable outcome that further destabilizes our border, risks the safety of our communities, and damages our economy by disrupting trade and tourism,' they said in a joint statement. 

Illegal foreign nationals  line up at a remote U.S. Border Patrol processing center after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday in Lukeville, Arizona.

'The Federal Government must act swiftly to maintain port of entry operations, get the border under control, keep Arizona communities safe, and ensure the humane treatment of illegal foreign nationals.'

Kelly and Hobbs, both Democrats, and Sinema, an independent who was elected as a Democrat, also criticized 'partisan politicians who parrot talking points while watching the border further deteriorate.'

They said those politicians should instead 'reject the echo chamber and work with us to get something done and keep our communities safe.'

An average of 3,140 people in vehicles and 184 pedestrians entered the U.S. daily in Lukeville during October, according to the U.S. Transportation Department´s latest figures.

Travelers will still be able to cross into or out of the United States through Nogales, Arizona, a three-hour drive to the east, or San Luis, Arizona, a two-hour drive to the west.

Despite violent crime across the country becoming the new normal and at an all time high – directly as a result of Biden’s and the dems’ policies - BIDEN AND THE DEMS HAVE EMERGED AS THE PARTY OF CRIMINALS AND LAWLESSNESS AS THEY SUPPORT BLATANT VIOLENCE AND THE DESTRUCTION OF LIVES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY AND A COMPLETE DEFUNDING AND DISMANTLING OF THE POLICE.

REMINDER: This is what Biden and the dems condone, support, want and stand for, as they are all supportive of defunding and completely dismantling and disbanding the police, despite riots, “occupied zones” and violent crimes, shootings and murders surging in each of their respective jurisdictions. Proof that the dem party has become the party of criminals and lawlessness and that they really don't care about ANY Americans (which includes people of all races, colors, religions, genders, classes, sexual orientations and heritages–including LEGAL immigrants), even their own constituents. In states and cities in which police were already defunded or even reduced, violent crimes and murders have increased significantly – and in a very short time immediately after the defunding. Every drop of blood spilt is on their hands. Proof once again that the dems do not care about anyone – even their own constituents – as they are willing to put us all in grave danger – or worse – just to forward their warped agenda. 

The dems are literally threatening and supporting the removal of our very security by completely defunding and dismantling the police across the country (while they have bolstered their own personal security at the taxpayers’ expense). 

GUN CONTROL DOES NOT WORK. The majority of guns used by criminals are bought on the black market - criminals do not obey laws. The last several terror attacks in Europe & the UK involved someone driving a van or another vehicle into a crowd, killing many people. The point is evil will find a way and if someone wants to kill someone they will find a way. Guns are illegal in France and yet 150 people died in a terrorist shooting in Paris. Chicago has the strongest gun control laws in the land and yet they have the highest number of shootings - over 5,000 last year alone (BTW WHERE IS THE LIBERAL AND MEDIA FAUX OUTRAGE THERE?? - and no the guns didn't come from out of state or another city, as the surrounding cities and states don't have nearly the same level of shootings as Chicago, in fact they have almost none), with NYC having the second highest number of shootings and NY has gun control laws almost as stringent as Chicago; California has more shootings than any state, and their laws are just as stringent as those of Chicago as well. Similarly, London, in which guns have been banned, just exceeded NYC's murder rate as they have seen an escalation of killings - SINCE THE BANNING OF GUNS, largely by knives. Australia – in which guns are illegal - recently had a school shooting in which 10 people were killed, 4 of which were children. In Japan – in which ALL GUNS ARE ILLEGAL – the Prime Minister was recently shot to death in broad daylight in public! Conversely, Switzerland has an incredibly high rate of gun ownership and practically zero mass shootings. The trans Nashville shooter purposely targetd a “gun-free zone”! Gun control doesn't work.

The solution is to INCREASE POLICE – not defund them - and allow them to do their job, while also putting bail back in place. It is no coincidence that the cities with the worst crime rates are all democrat run, have defunded and reduced the police, and removed bail, such that the few times the police are actually able to do their job the few criminals they actually capture are allowed back on the street the same day. In NYC, 85% of the crimes committed are by those who were arrested in the previous two weeks, but were let back on the street as a result of the fact that there is no bail. And btw, all these massive increases in crime occurred while each of these cities with the highest crime rates implemented the most stringent gun control laws in the country – in fact over the past few years (prior the point that crime has increased so precipitously), these cities’ respective gun laws have actually become more stringent. Proof once again, that gun control does not work.

Republican,post,Two-state solution,fs54c4,veryoutlive,thoughts about how media portrays republicans,"i am a firm believer that main stream media is bias, and i think that supporters on both the left and right can attest to that. i wanted to share some of my thoughts about how i feel the media portrays on what i feel are two of the most important republican ideals and see if other people agree, or if they feel targeted differently from other or the same subjects. i think the most obvious one i can point out is immigration. i think most republicans agree that hard working contributing immigrants are more than welcome in our country if they entire through the system legally. morally, i would be okay putting my tax dollars towards immigrants who are working their way to having their family pay into the tax system. on the flip side i don’t see it fit to have immigrants and sometimes law breaking immigrants enter the country illegally, living off the government dime and committing crime. i feel that not only is it legally and morally wrong, but it sets immigrants coming from asia and europe at a disadvantage from those coming from central america and mexico because of their easy access to our border. is the wall the best response to combat immigration, im not entirely sure, but it is better than having no solution and endless debates over right and wrong. other than immigration, i think the media portrays second amendment protecting republicans as evil and ok with the deaths of thousands of people in mass shootings. as i republican i would like to come out and say that i condemn these acts of hates and violence. i wouldn’t wish these acts upon my worst enemy nor should they ever take place again, but taking guns out of our hands is not the answer. the most common argument a liberal can give against guns is, “who needs an AR-15” when in reality they don’t live the same life as someone with an AR-15. this type of argument is similar to saying, well motorcycles aren’t really necessary so we are going to ban them, or cell phones are really distracting and taking many lives via distracted driving and suicide, so we are going to ban them. just because you don’t like something does not mean you can take it away from everything else. the freedoms we enjoy, living completely separate lives, affects the way we think and make decisions. as it pertains to guns, taking away the guns won’t fix anything, but rather increase gun violence, or knife violence as it has in london. we know from data that gun free spaces do not work. i feel like middle ground on a hot topic like this is working on loopholes within the gun buying system. since blue states are more strict than the red when it comes to buying firearms, a good compromise could make it where firearm laws and sales are the same across the nation. a gun you could buy in montana should be for sale in california. 

i’d love to hear everyone else’s opinions on some of the points i brought up, topics like this, and such others and i bring this forward with the upmost respect.",2020-03-31T02:59:31+00:00
Republican,comment,Two-state solution,flzpw91,Ricketier,,"I think generally people mostly want the same things on both sides. They want fairness and freedoms. Extremists on both sides are frequently pointed out and portrayed on TV, so that it's all people ever see when they look across the aisle.

Fundamentally most Democrats I know are Democrats because they believe corporate industries need checks, and that without them, they will marginalize the working man. I believe this is true. Many Republicans I know believe nobody should have a free handout, at least not permanent (obvious exceptions.)

So who doesnt agree with these fundamental things? But the parties both want power, so they drum up the other side as extreme. The media feeds and reports off this. And that's why things get devisive. Unfortunately, I believe trump has worsened the situation politically by basically drawing a line in the sand with his rhetoric.

Republican,post,Two-state solution,ns40f0,Any-Condition2313,Everything wrong with the Democrats since Obama,"Let's start.

**Global warming**

Quite... obvious.

Obama's promoting a buttload of solar panels...

And solar panels, contrany to popular belief, actually *contribute to global pollution.*

 

#### 1. Cost

[**The** **initial cost** **of purchasing a solar system**](https://www.greenmatch.co.uk/blog/2014/08/what-is-the-installation-cost-for-solar-panels) is fairly high. This includes paying for solar panels, inverter, batteries, wiring, and the installation. Nevertheless, solar technologies are **constantly developing**, so it is safe to assume that prices will go down in the future.

#### 2. Weather-Dependent

Although solar energy can still be collected during cloudy and rainy days, the efficiency of the solar system drops. Solar panels are **insanely dependent on sunlight** to effectively gather solar energy (they are literally **sun** energy collectors). Therefore, a few cloudy, rainy days can have a noticeable effect on the energy system. You should also take into account that solar energy cannot be collected during the night.

 

#### 3. Solar Energy Storage Is Expensive

Solar energy has to be **used right away**, or it can be **stored in large batteries**. These batteries, used in off-the-grid solar systems, can be charged during the day so that the energy is used at night. This is a good solution for using solar energy all day long but it is also quite expensive.

In most cases, it is smarter to just **use solar energy during the day** and take energy from the grid during the night (you can only do this if your system is connected to the grid). Luckily your energy demand is usually higher during the day so you can meet most of it with solar energy.

I should also mention that batteries are made of acid (poisonous) plastic (again poisonous) and graphite/metal (needs mining).

 

#### 4. Uses a Lot of Space

The more electricity you want to produce, the more solar panels you will need, as you want to collect as much sunlight as possible. [**Solar PV panels**](https://www.greenmatch.co.uk/solar-energy/solar-pv) require a lot of space and **some roofs are not big enough** to fit the number of solar panels that you would like to have. It does not matter if you have enough panels to

5. Where do you get the buttload of stuff to make them?

There are some **toxic materials and hazardous products** used during the manufacturing process of solar [**photovoltaic systems**](https://www.greenmatch.co.uk/solar-energy/photovoltaics/photovoltaic-system), which can indirectly affect the environment. The batteries needed to stow solar energy also creates acid, plastic, and metal. And where does plastic come from? O.I.L.

**Das taxes**

Obama's tax code make for an avreage of 40%. Yes. Let me get you a basic perspective here. If your income is the speed of light, Obama's tax code takes from you the velocity of a MAC round (cited in Halo Encyclopedia page 251). Yes, that's 40% lightspeed. Yes, Obama's tax code takes from you 40%. To get you a basic idea, for every ten hours you work, he takes 4. Biden has recently bumped up the tax from Trump's 1-5-10-15 to  37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes greater than $518,400 ($622,050 for married couples filing jointly). The other rates are: 35%, for incomes over $207,350 ($414,700 for married couples filing jointly) 

To use our WWII alglorithim, that is the caliber of the secondary gun on an M3 Lee (37mm)

That is crazy. [Put simply, having higher tax rates actually gives back far less tax income than lowering it to Trump's logical 1-5-10-15.](https://kluwerlawonline.com/journalarticle/Intertax/38.3/TAXI2010018)

 

**Foregin policy**

Let's say, Condi Rice comes to North Korea, which to be honest, has a [ridiculously](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/gQGIWk0PfHbuH6qKD1NOMSSpCmWi3PUtyScXWWugLLCmgrdui6ngcIY9glpDKDfx69f8Y1kqVwZ30pHC-7fBTV_uVqa4OeM1v5P9V510gQXglyHM7Um_9BEeH7UWmCpCrV6qfcXMV8bXSDo39CkU3iTE7BGnFQgYokM) [idiotic](https://i.imgflip.com/1xoilh.jpg) [army.](https://pics.me.me/north-korean-army-going-to-war-expectations-reality-north-korea-49045016.png) (1 word=1 pic)

And so what does she do? Yes, take a pic with the dictator, plop in her chair, and go home. And NUTHIN' happens.

I think you already understand by now.

 In Syria, he set a red-line warning against use of chemical weapons, watched the regime of Bashar Assad ignore it, then seemed to deliberate out loud through a kaleidoscope of options, from a military strike on his own authority, to a military strike with congressional assent, to diplomacy in league with a foreign leader, Vladimir Putin, who had spent the summer humiliating him in the Edward Snowden case. There is a coherent argument for military intervention. And there is another one for saying that that Assad’s atrocities are tragic but a problem for others to solve. But the president’s effort to argue both things came off as incoherent. Yes. He did NUTHIN'.

 

In Europe and the Middle East, Obama believed he was [**opening space for local leadership that failed to materialize**](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/). Elites in traditional allied nations, from Poland and Germany to Jordan and Saudi Arabia, saw the same choices as reflecting an Administration insufficiently engaged. When Obama’s first gambits failed, they said, as in Egypt or Syria or Russia, he lacked a backup plan. In Africa, Obama’s tenure was marked by much good will if few tangible accomplishments: little-remarked successes at halting mass atrocities in Kenya and Côte d’Ivoire, balanced by utter despair as government rivalries have spiraled back toward mass violence in South Sudan, a country his advisers had been essential in midwifing.

Looking back now, eight years of a new approach was hardly enough to undo 60 years of expectations of how the United States would behave, not to mention 60 years of politics and planning in other societies that depended on Washington behaving as it always had. Obama and his strongest supporters will say that they weren’t so naïve. Obama has [**pointed out to** ***Atlantic*** **writer Jeffrey Goldberg**](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/) that he fully expects to be alive in 25 years when longer-range judgments can be made—and that he anticipates they will be favorable.

This assumes, however, that the President’s successors would continue his approach. This same assumption seems to have informed decisions to make key policies by executive action rather than to invest the political capital needed to put them into laws and treaties—from [**the rules governing targeted killing**](https://www.justsecurity.org/36013/trump-unravel-obamas-rules-war/#more-36013) to the Paris Climate Accords to the slowness in dismantling the Bush-era system of registering visitors to the United States by religion.

And this assumption rested on another one: that Obama, such a talented communicator, could sell his approach to both American and global publics. However, here too, results were mixed. Pew Global Research [**found**](http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/1/survey/all/) that global publics did generally feel more positive toward the United States in 2016 than they had at the nadir of the Iraq War, but [**less positive**](http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/06/29/as-obama-years-draw-to-close-president-and-u-s-seen-favorably-in-europe-and-asia/) than in the first years of Obama’s presidency. At home, public skepticism toward military intervention stayed more closely in line with Obama’s views than those of more interventionist elites and, while U.S. society is divided sharply along partisan lines, [**majorities continued to see**](https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/publication/america-age-uncertainty?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ccs-report) globalization as positive, alliances as important, and trade as a net plus.

Yet Obama had difficulty hanging onto those majorities who, in theory, should have been supportive of his policies—much less in support of his party on national security and foreign affairs. The American people’s views of Obama’s foreign policy trended down during his first term, and up again slowly in the past year. But, on the aggregate, they’ve been more negative than positive since mid-2013, according to trend lines developed by [**HuffPost Pollster.**](https://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/obama-job-approval-foreign-policy) (By comparison, Obama’s polling trend lines have been net negative on health care since 2009, while positive on the economy since mid-2016, and net positive on overall job performance.)

Importantly, the Democratic Party and its elected officials in Congress never capitalized on early enthusiasm for Obama’s international record, never got much rhetorical cover from Obama on foreign policy, and drifted back down to a significant disadvantage against the GOP in public perceptions of security policy. The White House’s choice to limit the rhetoric it expended in support of international goals had multiple consequences: It made legislators less willing to go along with the White House, and it made every vote more politically costly. This pattern was set early when a plan to move some Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. evaporated when national security staff asked political staff for more public support, and were [**told**](https://books.google.com/books?id=qXAQt7YvmtkC&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=%22trying+to+bring+in+two+747s%22&source=bl&ots=m4uKZ_Leeh&sig=dSxziorwiX-Xys5DFeYiuamcxVw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjcn5r-p9TKAhVMXh4KHasKCLEQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22trying%20to%20bring%20in%20two%20747s%22&f=false) by then-chief of staff Rahm Emanuel:

>We are trying to bring in two 747s \[the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq\] at the same we are trying to reform our national health care system, and right in the middle you want to send up a flock of Canadian geese, which is Guantánamo, which could take down one of our 747s.

But perhaps most of all it deprived Obama of surrogates, at home and overseas, who could have made his case on international policy, and could still be making it now.

This mixed record suggests two main conclusions. First, that Obama well understood the mood of the American people. But, second, that he and his team did not come prepared to put in the capital and buy the political space to change 60 years of global diplomatic habit. His emphasis on negotiation and targeted force over large-scale occupation and old habits of alliance now appear a precursor to our new Dealmaker-in-Chief. Continuing to run many programs through the Defense Department rather than move them back to civilian agencies, and limiting the transparency and oversight accorded to many security initiatives, seemed efficient and effective, but may haunt the nation for decades ahead.

In a nutshell, what he did was to alienate Israel (our most important ally in the Middle East), embolden China, and cared nothing about Iran, who is pointing a nuke at our shores - and laughing at us.

**Second Ammendment.**

1, It is traditional and popular 

Gun ownership is a traditional part of American culture. A Gallup poll showed that in 2015, 41% of Americans owned a gun in their home. An October 2015 poll showed that 72% of Americans oppose laws to ban handguns (except by police officers or other authorised people). The same pollsters showed that 58% of Americans are ‘mostly favourable’ or ‘very favourable’ to American’s leading progun pressure group, the National Rifle Association (NRA). 

2, It protects citizens from tyranny 

The USA is traditionally suspicious of ‘government’ (not just ‘the Government’). This often takes the form of a deep suspicion of the federal government. The country was formed in the 1780s as a result of a revolution that freed the 13 colonies from what they saw as the tyrannical, oppressive government of the British. The logical extension of this argument is first, the government does not have the right to deny people the right to a gun, and second, an armed citizenry is essential to preventing democracy becoming tyranny in the future. 

3,It is a right guaranteed by the Constitution

 The US Constitution, in the Second Amendment, protects the right to gun ownership as it states that ‘the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed’. It is worth noting that many of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution are negative rights. Rather than being positive statements of the rights Americans possess, they are expressed in terms of what the federal government is not  allowed to ‘infringe’ or ‘abridge’. Thus, the right to own a gun is a right the federal government cannot restrict. 

4, It makes society safer 

Polls show that in October 2014, 63% of Americans thought having a gun in the house made it safer. Only 30% thought it made it more dangerous. This is because guns provide a means of self-defence. As Wayne LaPierre, the leader of the NRA, stated after the Newtown massacre: ‘The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun’. In other words, armed security guards in schools would make schools safer. Polls show that 56% of Americans believe the USA would be safer if more Americans carried concealed weapons. Many Americans believe gun control laws will not prevent mass shootings – 31% of Americans say it will ‘make no difference’ and 22% only ‘a little’. Only 19% think it will affect mass shootings ‘a great deal’. Many Americans argue mass shootings are a product of mental illness, drugs, extremist views online or violence in films, computer games and music. Consequently, gun control laws are not likely to prevent mass shootings. 

**TF is the ACA???**

 

**1. Health insurance is more expensive than ever.**

Remember the promise that the average family would save $2,500 a year on health insurance? Forget about it.

In May 2017 the Department of Health and Human Services reported that average health insurance premiums doubled since 2013. How many families’ incomes doubled over that same period?

In 2018 costs have risen by another 19 percent for high-cost plans and 32 percent for the cheapest plans, according to a study by the Urban Institute. Overall inflation for all other goods and services are running at 2 percent.

**2. Entitlement spending has exploded.**

Obamacare has driven entitlement spending up much faster than expected. The projected budgetary cost of Obamacare subsidies and Medicaid expansions from 2018 to 2027 now totals $4.8 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that Obamacare and its Medicaid expansion are responsible for 44 percent of the projected future increases in entitlement spending.

**3. Obamacare has not stopped the stampede of rising health care costs.**

Instead of “bending the cost curve down,” national expenditures on health care continue to rise.

The year before Obamacare was fully implemented, health care amounted to 17.2 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. Last year that tab grew to 18.3 percent—an increase of almost $200 billion in health spending. The latest forecast for 2025 is that medical expenses will reach almost 20 percent of GDP.

**4. Americans are paying more money for less health coverage.**

According to Kaiser, the average deductible for people with employer-provided health coverage last year was $1,221 compared to $303 in 2006. Usually, you pay higher deductibles for lower premiums. Under Obamacare, you pay more when you get your hospital bill.

**5. Fewer insurance choices.**

According to federal and state data of insurer exchange options per county, more than 50 percent of our nation’s counties have only one insurer in 2018. Over 30 percent of counties are limited to two insurers. This means roughly 4 of 5 counties will have either just one or two Obamacare exchange insurers to choose from.

**6. Medicaid enrollment is exploding.**

The vast majority of Americans who have received insurance under the Obamacare law have enrolled in Medicaid. Medicaid enrollment has soared from 55 million to 74 million since 2013. Yet many physicians, health clinics, and hospitals don’t accept Medicaid. This means tens of millions of Americans often can’t choose the doctor, hospital, or treatment of their choice.

Medicaid users in major cities experience an average denial rate of 47 percent. Mid-sized city Medicaid users have an average denial rate of 40 percent.

**7. Nearly 30 million Americans still uninsured.**

On April 1, 2014, standing in the Rose Garden at the White House, President Barack Obama claimed that the Affordable Care Act meant “everybody” would have health insurance. Today, some 30 million Americans remain uninsured to this day.

Why? Families can’t afford the insurance.

In 2012, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that Obamacare exchange enrollment would increase by 9 million by 2016. Instead, an underwhelming 400,000 increase occurred, which is a staggering 96 percent reduction in the anticipated growth of net-ACA exchange enrollment.

**8. Obamacare continues to ignore obvious cost-saving alternatives.**

Obamacare does not allow patients to buy insurance across state lines, which would dramatically increase competition and lower costs. It does not allow small business-associated health plans. It limits low-cost health savings accounts options. It has no provisions for capping medical malpractice costs—because Democrats were bought off by the trial lawyers.

Let’s summarize what we have gotten for our money under Obamacare. We have spent hundreds of billions of dollars already; we have massively increased the size of the federal budget; we have subsidized insurance plans to get Americans to sign up for Obamacare; we have penalized people if they don’t buy Obamacare (until that law was repealed); but we still have almost 1 in 11 Americans without insurance.

Throw Obamacare into the trash bin, ASAP.

**Infrastructure**

They say that a picture is worth a thousand words.

I think he’s got a good point though I think that it remains to be seen.

He said we shouldn't get involved in foreign countries, even Israel.

He said that the job of the US president is to care about the US's interests, and that includes being drawn into endless wars.

He said that such an endless war would be the invasion of gaza as there is no clear end goal, you can't remove Hamas as they are not just in gaza but they are all over the arab world. 

He didn't have a recommendation but said ""If I were president, I would support with intelligence agencies and diplomatic shielding if Israel were to have defined end-goals such as eliminating the top 100 in hamas"" (paraphrased).

Conservative,comment,Gaza,k5tw5i8,Jar_Squatter,,"I want to see Israel annihilate Hamas and demand a peace accord from any Gaza Palestinians that are left.  But his idea of what may happen is plausible. 

“Ramaswamy continued by stating his theory that, by invading Gaza, Israel would be crossing a “red line” of Hezbollah’s, another militant group stationed north of Israel, in Lebanon, which would trigger a “perfectly appropriate” two-front war, and leave Israel “mired in a ground conflict,” which, he claimed, the U.S. would inevitably end up fighting.”

Remember, this whole thing was set up by Iran as a way to derail normalization of relations between the Saudis and Israel.  This would provide long term stability to the area and create an exit ramp for the US in the Middle East.  So an invasion, although totally justified, plays right into the Iranian’s hands.  Maybe there is an alternate route of surgical strikes, special operations, and diplomacy with anyone in the area that wants peace.  We may beyond this point now though.",2023-10-21T13:41:52+00:00

There’s a pretty large difference between trying to root out a terrorist organization right outside your border in a plot of land not much larger than the size of Delaware vs. our situation with the Taliban. 

His primary concern seems to be U.S. involvement however in order to prevent further escalation from Hezbollah and the like you have to show the capability and willingness *to* get involved if the need arises. Hezbollah knows that if we intervene they will cease to exist anymore. Straight up.

Vivek goes on to say that IF Israel had an objective in the invasion to, say,  decapitate Hamas, he would be all for it.  Without addressing how that doesn't lead to the same consequences he was worried about before.

In summary - it makes no sense.  Israel is intent on destroying Hamas.  THAT is the objective for invading Gaza.  It's in the best interest of Israel AND the Palestinian people in the long run for that to happen.  Hamas in no way gives a crap about Palestine or the ordinary citizens of Gaza - they are religious zealots and wish to establish and rule an Islamic state (and eliminate everyone else).   If a broader regional war is going to break out, for Israel,  it's better for it to happen before Iran has nukes.

His point isn't very intelligent. ""The US might get dragged into it"". What do you think Iran's primary objective is? Once you understand the primary players and what they are trying to achieve, his ""ideas"" quickly look childish.

The accords with Saudi Arabia are already finished. Israel isn't a monolithic dictatorship, they have complicated political factions. Many of which were not keen on the agreement being made with Saudi Arabia. Which was going to include a well defined region of the West Bank that is carved out into Palestine.

With the attack made by Iran/Hamas it ensured the political factions became more aggressive and the Israel population at large is out for blood. If you remember the aftermath of 9/11 you will know what this is like.

And that is just one side of it. The very successful nature of the attack and corresponding hospital propaganda as stirred all the Muslim nations in the area. So Saudi Arabia which was negotiating on their behalf have a revolt. As some have seen Israel bleed, which means blood is in the water. 

As well as rage over Hamas killing of their own people with the rocket misfire into the hospital parking lot. Most people in the Middle East still believe Israel did it. There are countless people in the US who are denying the dead babies and think Israel blew up the hospital. If you don't believe me go on X for a few hours. It's all over it.

\-George Bush, October 7th, 2001.

Do these remarks on our engagement in Afghanistan sound familiar? How did that turn out?

This war is likely going to go exactly the same way as our war in Afghanistan, and I think that's what is informing Vivek's opinions on this matter. After all, he says that Israel's aims are unclear. Sure, they have explicit goals, remove Hamas, but how is that any different than our aims going into Afghanistan? Whats going to happen when they acheive their short-term objectives? Have it turn into an endless occupation and money drain for the next 20 years?

Conservative,post,IDF (Israel Defense Forces),17gpi5x,ultimis,The Case Against Trump being the GOP Nominee,"Essay I found that covers a whole host of issues with Trump from those who are backing DeSantis. I know most people aren't going to want to read this. But it gives the complete break down of problems with a Trump candidate and just Trump in general. And before you go ""TDS, derp a derp"". I voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. Nostalgia and martyrdom shouldn't be clouding your judgment. If anything bullet number 2 should make you question your support given what will happen. Yes, I also believe the the prosecutions are politically motivated. That will not change the outcome of what we all know is going to happen.

Anyways, hopefully people take the time to digest this. Though most likely it will be buried into oblivion never to be seen by the average subreddit user while I will get ""TDS"" spammed in the response. This is about the good of our country, which Democrats are determined to bring to ruin.

----

Here are the Top 25 reasons (version 3.1) most DeSantis supporters are done with Trump, even though nearly all of us voted for him twice:

1 - **He didn't deliver on his frequent campaign refrains**: ""drain the swamp"" or ""build the wall and make Mexico pay for it"" or ""lock her up."" 

The swamp got worse during his Presidency because he added to it. He made no effort to ""drain"" any of it. 
Remnants of the wall lay rusting along the border or have been sold off. Recently, Trump confessed there was no actual mechanism to get Mexico to pay for the wall. 
He let Hillary off the hook two weeks after taking office, saying the idea of it sold well before the election. As if that broken promise wasn't enough, a few weeks later, Trump invited the Clintons to his inaugural luncheon, pointed to them, thanked them for coming, said he was honored they attended, led a standing ovation for them, and then proclaimed, ""I have a lot of respect for those two people.""

Other Promises unkept: Trump DID NOT—Repeal the alternative minimum tax, Cut the number of tax brackets, End birthright citizenship, Enact 5-year ban on White House and congressional officials from lobbying, Impose death penalty for cop killers, Reverse China's entry into the World Trade Organization, Impose a hiring freeze on federal employees, Eliminate wasteful spending in every department, Place lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying for foreign government, Bring back manufacturing, Grow the economy by 4 percent a year, Add additional federal investment of $20 billion toward School Choice, Adopt the penny plan, Cancel all funding of sanctuary cities, Dramatically scale back the U.S. Education Department, Expand national right to carry to all 50 states (in fact, Trump went after the 2nd Amendment), Remove all undocumented immigrants, Eliminate gun-free zones at schools and military bases, Eliminate Common Core, Triple ICE enforcement, Get Congress to allow health insurance across state lines, Renegotiate the Iran deal, or Repeal and replace Obamacare, AND many other promises.

2 - **He will be embroiled in legal troubles throughout the general campaign**, will likely lose independents and the election, and I shudder to think what that does down ballot. He WILL be convicted in one or more of these cases. Getting a fair trial in a DC court if you are a republican or conservative is a unicorn. Trump is facing 4 criminal cases with 3 leftist jury pools in NY, DC, and Fulton County, GA. The idea he won’t be convicted is unbelievably naïve. Federal indictments have a 91+% success rate and Trump is facing two federal cases with multiple indictments. The first case in GA is a RICO prosecution that three of Trump's lawyers have already plead guilty to lesser charges and will be testifying. It is conceivable that Trump is convicted in GA by JAN/FEB 2024, perhaps before the Iowa Caucuses.
MAGA says they are all bogus and he will win on appeal. Again, this is incredibly naïve. The appeals process can take years and Trump would have to thread the needle on ALL of them to avoid prison time or house arrest.
But what does even one conviction mean to the GOP’s chances of winning the election? MAGA believes in “polls” now, so let’s go there. **A Reuters poll in August suggests that Trump could lose up to 50% or more of Republican voters if Trump is convicted**. That’s right, Republican voters. Even if this poll is half accurate, Trump's lose would be the largest landslide in history. This idea that everyone outside of MAGA (other Republicans, Moderates, Independents) would interpret a conviction like MAGA does, as ""political persecution,"" and vote Trump into office so that he could pardon himself, is ludicrous.

MAGA points to the current polls showing him in a virtual tie or leading Biden. Sure. These “polls” are 13 months from a general election. That's before the incessant drum beat for a whole year during the general, when ad after ad and the media attack Trump over these court cases and everything else. 40+% of voters are indifferent, superficial, impressionable, or are currently not paying attention. Do you think it was an accident that the DC trial date is the day before Super Tuesday? These people know Trump’s empathy appeal spikes his polls and they’re counting on you to feel bad for him and make him the nominee. If a convicted Trump is our nominee, we lose everything. It's a trap. Don't fall for it.

3 - **Even if he miraculously wins, he loses**. He might pardon himself for the federal charges, but what about the state charges? How will that self-pardon play? “The first President to ever pardon himself.” Good luck in 2026 and 2028 with that narrative noose around our GOP necks. If Dems win the House, they will impeach him again for one or more of these convictions. And what if he is actually guilty for even one of these charges? I hope not, but what if he did even one of the things he’s indicted for? How does that sit with you? Either way, innocent or not, it won’t be resolved for years, and it won’t change the effect. Even if he’s cleared of all charges, he won't be able to govern because no agency will work with him knowing they can just wait him out. Congress won't either. Why would they work with a damaged President to fix anything? Good luck cleaning house when no one will work with you. Who is going to serve in a second Trump admin? His chief of staff was indicted in GA. What quality people are going to sign up to serve if Trump is going to engage in even one questionable act that may drag them down with him?  Are we winning one or both houses? Good luck passing legislation without both Houses. Ruling by Executive Orders like he did the first time will be a nice temporary relief, but you better stock up for the next Democrat in office. Trump will be a lame duck the moment he takes the oath.

4 - **He's almost 80, and he looks all of it and unwell**. He’s almost 80 and running for the most demanding job in the world. Don't complain about Biden's age and then elect Trump. Americans have been retired for nearly a decade at this point in their lives. Old people don’t decline at a steady rate. They decline rapidly. Instead of MAGA telling him, ""Thank you. Well done. You exposed them. We got this. Retire and help us win,"" they're trying to martyr him and blow up the GOP in the process. Well, that isn't very bright. Unless you want to form your own viable party or tolerate the alternative, a leftist hellscape that used to be America, blowing up the GOP is not an option. The GOP isn't perfect, but it isn't homogenous, and it never will be. You must tolerate mushy moderates because 50+% of the country are NEVER going to be MAGA purists. I don’t want another octogenarian as President. Reagan had Alzheimer’s during his second term, Biden is a walking corpse. Not doing that again.

5 – **Trump is not a good judge of character** and frequently lets foxes in the henhouse if they stroke his ego.

6 – A very large number of people who worked with him and for him are not supporting him in 2024. In fact, **40 out of 44 cabinet members he hired are not supporting his 2024 bid**. MAGA will say they are all losers or RINOs he exposed. To that, I say, it's unlikely that they are all bad people. But if they are, please see #5.

7 - **Trump wasn't prepared when he took office and left hundreds of Obama holdovers in power**. These same people undermined him and his administration. MAGA always points to the unprecedented level of attacks, internal “deep state” pushback, allegations, and unnamed sources within the government undermining him. They fail to realize, acknowledge, or accept that Trump allowed most of this to happen because he was incompetent and unprepared to handle the duties of President. If you leave leftists in power, they will torch you the first chance they get. He didn’t admit to these mistakes and change direction. Trump left leftists and swamp creatures in power even as they undermined him.

8 – No matter how he frames it and revises history, after Covid happened, **he did everything Fauci and company wanted and signed whatever legislation Nancy Pelosi put in front of him**, including the Cares Act, which turned out to be the biggest tool of the 2020 vote steal. Certainly, no one knew the severity of the virus or the science of Covid that early on, and he couldn’t have known how he was being lied to at the time, but he refused to remove Fauci from the task force, gave Fauci an award on the way out the door, and basically ceded the management of the country over to the medical swamp for most of the final year of his term. To this day, he refuses to acknowledge his mistakes, defends the vax, falsely claims his vax has saved 100 million lives, falsely claims he couldn’t have removed Fauci, and claims he did everything right.

9 – **Trump spent us into oblivion during his first term**. Sure, Covid happened, but he was running trillion dollar plus deficits every year before Covid. There wasn’t a single spending bill Trump didn’t sign. He ran up almost 8 trillion dollars of debt (62% of which came BEFORE Covid), and failed again to live up to his campaign and administration promises. You can't print/spend/borrow 7.8 trillion above incoming tax revenue and NOT also expect eventual inflation, higher interest rates, and a devalued dollar. Look at your gas prices and grocery bill. Obama, Biden, AND Trump DID THAT.

10 – **Trump had the WH, House, and Senate his first two years and squandered his Congressional majorities**. He failed to replace Obamacare. He failed to permanently secure the border, because Executive Orders don’t last and the wall, finished or not, clearly doesn’t work on its own. He failed to address term limits in Congress. He failed to drain the swamp even one millimeter, which is probably the biggest, most impactful failure of all. He ruled by Executive Orders his whole Presidency, which Biden trash canned his first day in office. The ONLY policies/deeds of significance that remain from Trump's Presidency are his court appointments that he picked from a list that was handed to him and unpaid for tax cuts that are about to expire.

11 - **His obsession with loyalty always seems to be a one-way street**, especially if it means that his money is involved (i.e., J6ers, Rudy G, K. Mac, those indicted with him, etc.). These people “bled” for him and he trashes them or refuses to help them. He could have helped pay for non-violent J6er’s defense, he could have at least visited them in prison, he could have used his contacts to possibly make a difference in their treatment, or perhaps he could have even showed some meaningful public support for them. He did NOTHING. To this day, he’s DONE NOTHING. What he DID DO on January 6th: Trump held the rally in DC. He worked up his supporters into a frenzy with the belief that their election had been stolen. He said J6ers should march to the capital. Then, he then went out the next day and publicly called them criminals. He ultimately raised 250 million off the “Stop the Steal” campaign after the election and spent ZERO dollars to help pay for the legal expenses J6ers faced.

12 - **His ""airing of grievances,"" court cases, and whole focus is on the past**. I'm not interested in the past. Was it stolen? Even if you discount the suitcases under benches and trucks rolling in at 3 AM, state secretaries changed the rules without their legislatures and the media/gov/social media suppressed the HB laptop story, so YES, it was stolen. But, Trump lost, even enabling the instruments of that loss (Cares Act), he didn't protect the elections, and whether it was stolen or not, crooked Joe Biden is in the WH. Trump was in charge and he let it happen.

13 - **Trump DOES NOT have the ability to engage in meaningful exchanges where he explains and sells his choices, policies, comments, and governing philosophy**. He doesn't fight the narratives festering around him. Calling it ""fake news,"" while true, is not an adequate defense to keep the proposed narrative from defining you. You must attack the narrative and the premises under it with logic, reason, and voracity. If you dismantle the narrative or the argument or the loaded reporter question, you stop the media and democrats from selling their crap to the public. Trump is either unwilling or incapable of doing this, and doing this is extremely integral to getting legislation passed and winning elections.

14 - **He regularly punches down at people and engages in petty battles that mean nothing**. The list of people and organizations Trump has needlessly attacked over some perceived slight or his ego, using the public platform of his Presidency and 2024 candidacy, is too long to catalogue here.

15 - **He doesn't deserve the nomination if he's unwilling to earn it**. He is not owed anything. There is no such thing as ""his turn."" This isn’t a monarchy. Candidates who throw their hat into the ring are NOT “disloyal.” Skipping debates because of 'polling numbers' is entitled and indicative of someone who is afraid to defend his record or defend his reasons for seeking a second term. He is not even campaigning more than a few times a month. He spends his days golfing and rage truthing and making dozens of ludicrous video mini-speeches, as if he’s still President.

16 - He's a clever politician, entertainer, marketer, and businessman, but **his positions and principles are often for sale if the deal is right**.

17 - **Trump is woefully arrogant, a malignant narcissist**, and makes every single thing about himself. He rarely says ""we,"" refers to himself constantly in the 3rd person, and that says a lot.

18 - Trump's campaign is tangentially about the future, but that's not the main thrust of it. **His campaign is mostly about revenge and his ego**, not the good of the country. If he was thinking solely about the country, he would drop out, handle his legal woes, and help us do what he was unable to do.

19 - **Ultra MAGA, his cult following, not the persuadable, is nothing more than an identity group engaging in identity politics**. They are an identity group, just like BLM, feminists, LGBTQ, etc. They held up Trump as their champion because they felt disenfranchised, marginalized, and oppressed, and Trump was the force they put forward to tear it all down. At first, like many identity groups, there was validity to many of their grievances. The working class had been forgotten, the system was and is not working on their behalf. But unlike most identity groups, they wanted the existing system to begin working for them. They wanted a course correction. However, like ALL identity groups, their impetus changed and devolved into something darker and delusional. Ultra MAGA wants to tear it all down. They want a system that is right in their own eyes. They want to abandon the rule of law and exact ""justice"" on their own terms. Where their interests and the Constitution align, they embrace it. Where it doesn't, they ignore it. Ultra MAGA embraces and employs the tactics of leftists now. They are now what these other identity groups always were, militant grievance hustlers who ignore truth and morality and reality to serve their own ends. Trump is their vehicle, their champion, because he is the embodiment of their moral evolution. He was in 2016 what they've become in 2023.
If this battle is not about realistic policy goals and re-constitutionalizing our government, and it's about name-calling, tearing down proven conservatives and good people, and constantly lobbing hate and false accusations, we deserve to lose. We are no better than the leftists who do it.

20 - While the ""listless vessel"" comment hurt Trump’s cult of personality voters, DeSantis wasn't wrong, and it needed to be said. This isn’t name calling. It’s just the objective truth. **Some of these Trump supporters act like he’s second only to Christ himself and no matter what he says or does, they defend it**. They “feel” Trump. Trump is their persecuted, post-modern Jesus, a relativistic elixir salesman promising miracles, so they’ll find any excuse to validate their support and vote for him, even if he’s not worthy of it. I’m not sure where this comes from. Perhaps these devotees relate to his defiant demeanor, his grievance politics, because they too feel like victims of this economy and society and life in general, and they live vicariously through his full-throated “screw you” to the world. But it’s a cloud, some fog they all live in. Trump is not coming on a white horse to vanquish all their real and perceived enemies. He’s not going to deal some great vengeance on the deep state or lock all these bad actors up, for all the reasons I have already mentioned. Re-capturing our freedoms and our country can't be about one man.

21 – **Where is Melania? Where is his wife?** Between the court cases and his family, Trump has more pressing matters to attend to. His ego needs to take a back seat and he needs to step down for the good of the country and himself.

22 - **Trump thinks evangelicals are idiots, chumps** who can be manipulated because we are, in his mind, hyper-emotional followers of some sky wizard he knows nothing about. It was his recent speech in DC that confirmed this.
First, he bumbled through the issue of abortion for 3-4 minutes, repeating himself and talking about ""making deals"" on the issue. He's not seriously pro-life. He is not principled on any issue. His principles are for sale if the deal is right. In the recent interview with Meet the Press, he talked in a way that suggests he wants to apply the Art of the Deal to the arbitration of human life, and it was SICK. Making a deal with Democrats on abortion means ""Trump will sell the Pro-Life Movement out."" He didn't even push back on the lies of the interviewer who falsely asserted over and over that ""no Democrat"" wants late term abortion access.
Second, Trump told the audience that Melania was watching from home and that she called him about the persecution he is going through, but he has yet to explain why she is never with him anymore. He wanted evangelicals, who he believes are ""suckers"" for the concept of healthy marriages, to believe there is nothing wrong in his marriage when it is clear there is something wrong.
Third, Trump's team badly timed some hollywood-esque dramatic background music at the end of his speech and he faked a tragic hero act to swoon us, because he thinks we're all stupid saps who cry at Lifetime and Hallmark movies. Except, the timing of the music was off because he goes off script so much that the content he read had zero emotional value. He wasn't at the big closing, so the music and persecuted Trump act came off as awkward and manipulative. So, tell me evangelicals, are you as stupid as Trump believes you are?

23 – **Trump is NOT the fantastic leader people make him out to be**. Outside of a combative demeanor, maybe some courage and a ham-fisted level of delegation, he's mostly a barking entertainer. To this day, he NEVER admits his failures, he belittles people for any perceived slight or valid criticism, he lies about what he has said and his record, he praises and relates to despicable people, and he completely lacks the following leadership qualities: Communication, Empathy, Humility, Integrity, Emotional Intelligence, Creativity, Accountability, Learning agility, Self-awareness, Active Listening, Empowerment, Positivity, Honesty, Focus, Strategy, and the Courage to do what is right despite the political consequences.

24 – **Trump has always been an unwise, gaffe-prone, ego-feeding, insult machine**, and though it can be entertaining when he angers all the right people, it can be deflating and even harmful when he makes everything about himself and criticizes the people who support him and the allies who America needs to support. Recent example - While it is true that Israel and Bibi failed to secure their borders and protect their citizens, Trump did NOT need to harp on this obvious failure 4 days after Israel’s 9/11 scale terrorist attack. He publicly criticized Bibi, the IDF Defense minister, and then showed respect to the enemy of Israel, Hezbollah, as “very smart.” The bodies of our 25 countrymen and 1400 allies were not even cold. American hostages remain un-rescued. Trump lacks wisdom. He lacks timing. He lacks leadership. Right after the slaughter of innocents, Trump chose to highlight his personal issues with Netanyahu, and that is disgusting.

25 - **Trump 2023 is NOT Trump 2016, and it isn't even close**. Some of it is clearly his age. Trump spends his days golfing, rage-truthing, and delivering Trump PSAs to his iPhone in front of his Mar-A-Lago fireplace. In many ways, Trump is like my rapidly aging Great Uncle, who slurs his words, can't hear very well, screams at the television, and tells stories about the ""good ole' days"" where he is always the central heroic figure. My Great Uncle is entertaining, but I'd be nuts to take a single thing he says as fact or take one piece of advice he gives outside of how to make his eggs for breakfast. This is Trump in front of waning crowds in 2023—a disillusioned and delusional entertainer who tells every story with himself at the center, who rails at unseen enemies, and who hasn't yet realized that his time to leave the stage has long since passed.

**Conclusion** – Trump’s failures as President, his challenges in getting elected and governing effectively, and his deep and pervasive personal flaws leads to ONLY ONE conclusion - **Trump is NOT qualified to be our choice for President in 2024**. Choosing a path for our country that includes Trump in any role of leadership will lead to the ruination of the GOP and to a trifecta of Democrat power and every leftist law imaginable.

The Only Choice — DeSantis has all the leadership traits in spades. He is a much, MUCH better option moving forward. He's not an entertainer. But he is an honest, competent, highly intelligent, effective, and principled leader. He can also serve 2 terms.
RD isn’t “bought” a “RINO” or a “globalist."" Those people who try to use “guilt by association” ignore Trump’s associations with these same people WHILE he was in office and afterward (Ryan, Rove, Bush, etc.). Trump endorsed and is endorsed by numerous ""RINOs.""

DeSantis, however, came from a middle-class family. He's a veteran, a founding member of the Freedom Caucus in Congress who sold all his stock to avoid even the hint of impropriety. He rejected his Congressional pension because he believes government should be about selfless-service. He left Congress after three terms because he believes in term limits. He then became the best governor Florida has ever seen, delivering on every single promise. DeSantis is a family man and a fighter against false narratives. He’s also a 5-time winner who has done ALL he said he would do. He’s a relentless, shrewd administrator and leader who gives us the best chance to win and make a significant dent in the government bureaucracy.

The Presidency should not be a sepulchre for the aging politicians, family dynasties, statesmen, or even heroes of our time. 
The Presidency should not house the idols of our sports teams, films, or TV programs. 
The Presidency should not raise any man to the office  who might be esteemed to be more than he is, just a man. 
The Presidency should be attained by a man who is willing to put country before self, who has the energy to work 80–90-hour weeks, who does what is objectively and morally right, no matter the cost. 
The Presidency should be given to a man who has proven his honesty, who has delivered on his promises, who has fought his enemies and won time and again, and who has led with competence, integrity, humility, empathy, and effectiveness through challenging times and crises. 
Ron DeSantis should be chosen as our next President. There has never been a clearer choice. It’s simply time to turn the page on Trump. We have a MUCH better option.",2023-10-26T05:42:41+00:00

Those claiming he should have ""campaigned better"" have zero explanations for what he could have done to overcome Martyrdom that Trump achieved with the political prosecutions. Some state he should have been attacking him more aggressively, but that would have resulted in backlash as it's not a good look to ""kick"" someone who is perceived to be ""down"". 

DeSantis and Vivek are America First candidates. Though Vivek has no record. DeSantis has a long record of achieving America First principles.

If you have watched any Trump surrogates they have spent the last 6 months spamming AI images of Trump. They do this because Trump is old and feeble and isn't making as many appearances. So their PR campaign uses AI images to try and make him seem impressive.

Conservative,post,PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization),3rtjer,JohnSemmens,"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: November 8, 2015 Edition","Hillary Boasts ""I Am Unstoppable""

In an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel's late night talk show, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton proclaimed her election next year as ""inevitable. Nominally, Bernie Sanders is still in the race, but since he virtually endorsed me at the debate I think he's seen the writing on the wall and will soon follow Webb and Chafee to the exit.""

She was even more dismissive of the Republican candidates calling them ""an assortment of nuts oblivious to what it takes to govern. If we are to believe the polls, GOP voters are rejecting the one candidate who has a successful record of governing the State of Florida. Even at that, none of them have had to make the hard choice to put people in harms' way for the good of the country. They are all neophytes with clean hands.""

So confident is the former Secretary of State that she averred that not even her husband could beat her in an election. ""He would run again if he could,"" Hillary said. ""But he wouldn't stand a chance in a race against me. He is a skirt-chaser in an era when the American voter is yearning for a skirt-wearer. I am that unstoppable skirt-wearer.""

Candidate Seeks to Regain Senate Seat with Promise of Higher Taxes

Convinced that Americans are grossly under taxed, former Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold is on a crusade to regain the seat he lost to current Republican Senator Ron Johnson in 2010.

""The evidence is overwhelming,"" Feingold asserted. ""Americans are suffering from a surfeit of income that they are squandering on purchases that are detrimental to their well-being. They are over-eating and over-drinking. They are living in single-family homes when they should be living in high-density apartments. They are driving cars when they should be riding public transit. The list of obnoxious and self-indulgent expenditures is lengthy and nauseating.""

Feingold touted his credentials as a tax-hiker during his 18-year tenure in the US Senate from 1993 to 2011 as proof he is the man to help Americans break their spending habits. ""In the years I represented Wisconsin in the Senate I voted for higher taxes on nearly 300 separate occasions,"" the ex-senator bragged. ""Since Johnson took over he has been largely an enabler of private selfishness—resisting numerous efforts by the President and the Democratic Party to relieve taxpayers from the temptations of excessive wealth.""

According to Feingold, the need to oust Johnson in 2016 is made more urgent by his support for a Constitutional amendment that would require a two-thirds majority before tax increases could be enacted. ""This is the exact opposite of what we should be doing,"" Feingold insisted. ""We need to get beyond the simplistic notion that the money a person earns is his to do with as he pleases. All income, all wealth ought to be the common property of all. Government, as the representative of all ought to control how money is spent. If I am elected this is what I'll strive to do.""

PLO Assails Cruz Hearing on Terrorism

The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) took issue with how Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) handled a hearing on Middle East terrorism. The hearing entitled, ""Justice Forsaken: How the Federal Government Fails the American Victims of Iranian and Palestinian Terrorism,"" featured witnesses describing attacks by Palestinian suicide bombers against innocent victims.

PLO spokesman Haikil Juze complained that ""these hearings are one-sided and biased. Contrary to the propaganda spouted by Cruz and his witnesses, Jews are not innocent. The Quran makes that clear. It is every Muslim's sacred duty to strike down these minions of Satan wherever, whenever, and however they can.""

Juze condemned ""Cruz's failure to mention the provocations committed by the Israelis. First of all, the mere presence of Jews in lands conquered for Allah more than a thousand years ago is an intolerable affront. Second, Jewish whores parade around the streets with their faces and limbs uncovered inducing irresistible lust among innocent Muslim men. Third, the Quran expressly prohibits non-Muslims from owning weapons. Yet, Jews walk the streets with firearms in their hands, over their shoulders, or on their hips. Rage and revenge is our only honorable option. Cruz's aim to deny us this option violates our religious freedom.""

Presidential Press Secretary Josh Earnest called Cruz's efforts ""unhelpful. The President, who is a great admirer of Lincoln, urged me to convey the message that if he could achieve peace in the region without harming any Jews he would do it, and if he could achieve peace by harming all the Jews he would do it; and if he could achieve peace by harming some and leaving others alone he would also do that.""

Congresswoman Urges Limits to Freedom of Speech

Incensed that Donald Trump might be permitted to host Saturday Night Live, Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif) says ""the government needs to step in and prohibit the kind of racist and anti-social remarks that Trump and his ilk are inflicting on this country.""

""Freedom of speech is not a privilege that we should allow people to abuse,"" Sanchez opined. ""Too many have died fighting for freedom of speech for us to sit by while those unworthy of the privilege pollute the airwaves with anti-government rhetoric. Disagreement that goes beyond acceptable bounds must be curtailed. Persons who cannot politely engage in convivial interactions should be restrained for the common good. It is long past time that the government establish and enforce guidelines for what is permissible and what is not.""

""The danger of unrestrained free speech was recently brought home by the savage beating of an Hispanic man in Boston by a white thug who admitted that Donald Trump said it was okay,"" Sanchez argued. ""How many more Hispanics, Blacks, and Muslims will have to suffer before we silence inciters like Trump?""

DOJ Abolishes Term: ""Juvenile Delinquent""

US Attorney General Loretta Lynch has decreed that the Department of Justice will no longer use the term ""juvenile delinquent"" to describe youthful lawbreakers. The new term to be used is ""justice involved youth.""

""Juvenile delinquent has too negative a connotation,"" Lynch said. ""Both words are demeaning. The word 'juvenile' is frequently used to convey an impression of immaturity. To call someone juvenile is, by itself, insulting. Similarly, the word 'delinquent' is judgmental. It communicates a message of wrongful behavior.""

""The new terminology is more positive sounding,"" she continued. ""A justice involved youth does not stigmatize an individual. It just says that a young person is linked in some way with the justice system just like judges and attorneys are linked to the justice system. The phrase itself could be taken to mean that the youth may be an intern or aide rather than a criminal.""

""Just because a young person may have broken some laws doesn't prove he is bad,"" Lynch contended. ""He could have good reasons for his behavior. Maybe he comes from a broken home. Maybe he is poor. Maybe his need for what he stole is greater than that of the person he stole from. Maybe being a member of a gang is normal in his neighborhood. Maybe killing members of rival gangs or witnesses is self-defense. Maybe we need to be more understanding and not as quick to condemn behavior we don't fully understand.""

Brown Defends Asking State Experts to Report on His Land

California Governor Jerry Brown insisted that ""there's nothing wrong with what I did."" What he did was ask employees of the California Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources—a state agency—to tell him whether there is oil on his private property.

""I didn't ask for any special treatment,"" Brown asserted. ""I did what any citizen of the state might have done.""

""Well, I suppose that any citizen could've asked for the same thing,"" an employee said in an ""off-the-record"" interview. ""But we wouldn't have prepared that citizen a 51 page report. When the Governor 'asks' you hop to if you want to keep your job.""

Brown contrasted ""the trifling amount of money involved"" with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's performance of favors for foreign governments that made donations to the Clinton Foundation. ""Bill and Hillary raked in tens of millions of dollars using the leverage she had as this county's head diplomat. At most, the report I got cost tens of thousands. I think those of us engaged in public service—presidents, secretaries, governors, senators, etc are entitled to a few perqs considering all the sacrifices we make for those we serve.""

Billionaire Says Socialism Needed to Stem Climate Disaster

Microsoft multi-billionaire Bill Gates averred that freedom and democracy will need to be sacrificed if we are to avert climate disaster. ""Left to their own devices, common people don't see the need for action to prevent global warming,"" Gates lamented. ""They are too prone to place having a job, food on the table, and a comfortable home ahead of working against global warming.""

Gates advised ""a top down imposition of socialism to overcome individual resistance to the measures deemed essential for taming runaway climate change. Only socialism can stifle prosperity sufficiently to achieve the reductions in human activities that contribute to warming. The elimination of conveniences like electricity, running water, and personal transportation for all but the world's most important persons is the price our species must be willing to pay to save the planet. History has shown that socialist regimes are the most effective at attaining the type of economy required to shrink the human footprint.""

In support of his argument, Gates pointed to socialist Venezuela as a preview of what is possible. ""It is in Venezuela that a pack of french fries at McDonald's now costs $130,"" Gates observed. ""This will dramatically cut back consumption. No free market capitalistic system could achieve as much in so short a period of time. It is only by bringing an end to widely available and inexpensive consumer goods and services that we can save the Earth. For this socialism is essential.""",2015-11-06T22:27:34+00:00

I am aware of two Republican anti-Semites, and one of those is a ""Republican"" who the party disavowed after he switched from being a Democrat and ran as a Republican.

The other one is Tom Emmer - who was recently in the running for House Speaker until that came out and Trump argued against him.  So far as I am aware, Emmer's anti-Semitism was limited to using an anti-Jewish trope in his campaign advertising.

conservatives,comment,Palestine,k6n62di,keypuncher,,"The universities are breeding grounds for anti-Semitism.  They were infiltrated by literal communists almost a century ago as part of the communist effort to subvert everything in the US.  That reads like a conspiracy theory, but did actually happen.  The House UnAmerican Activities Committee and Joe McCarthy in the US Senate made an effort to deal with it, but pivoted from Nazis to Communists too late, and the communists were too deeply entrenched in the entertainment industry and in the higher education system.

The media vilified McCarthy, but the Venona Intercepts and the opening of the USSR Archives after the fall of the Soviet Union proved he was correct.  Franklin Roosevelt's Presidential administration was penetrated by communists at the most senior levels, up to and including his closest advisor.

Ironically many of those communists were themselves Jews.

Jews rarely fare well in communist revolutions, once the revolution has succeeded.

Some of the top leaders in the Russian revolution were Jews... and that went about as well as it usually does.

In the US the revolution hasn't happened yet, so many Jews are still big fans of communism on the theory that surely it will be different this time.  The Marxists teaching in our universities, are busy teaching their students to hate Israel, Jews, Republicans, white people, men, and western civilization in general.

...and because public schoolteachers go through those universities, many are coming out as good little Marxists and are doing the same thing in the public schools.  The Democrats are all in favor of this.

In the recent changeover of the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Democrats were voting in lockstep for Hakeem Jeffries, who has a history of defending anti-Semitism and the anti-Semitic views of Louis Farrakhan.  All of the House Democrats, including the 24 Jews.

Of our 50 State governors, 26 are Republican - and the only one who has told state colleges to disband pro-terrorist student groups, and sent aid to Israel is one of those 26.",2023-10-27T05:03:10+00:00

The left claims that the Nazis and fascists were on the political right.  They were (and are) not.  The other significant anti-Semitic group identified with the right is the KKK - which was started by Democrats to prevent emancipated blacks from voting Republican.

The ""Republican"" I mentioned was David Duke - who was a Democrat for many years, and was disavowed by Republicans at the national level when he switched parties.

conservatives,post,Jerusalem,18825rk,Head_Estate_3944,"Fragile cease-fire between Israel and Hamas Palestinian terrorists threatened by Jerusalem bus stop attack which killed 3, injured 8 Israeli civilians.","The fragile cease-fire between Israel and Hamas Palestinian terrorists came close to being shattered after a pair of gunmen opened fire on a crowded bus stop in Jerusalem Thursday, killing three people and injuring at least eight.

The attackers, two Palestinian brothers aligned with Hamas causes, struck at 7:40 a.m. local time in the first attack on Israeli civilians since the Oct. 7 terror strike by Hamas Palestinian terrorists against Israel.

The assault came less than an hour after the truce between Israel had been set to expire at 7am.  However, it was extended by 24 hours just minutes before its expiration after agreements to exchange hostages and Hamas Palestinian prisoners were reached.

The bus stop bloodshed was caught on surveillance video, which showed a white sedan pulling up to a packed bus station at the entrance to the city.

The two Palestinian gunmen brandishing guns jumped out and charged at the Israeli crowd as people ran for their lives in terror.

“The Palestinian terrorists arrived at the scene by car in the morning, armed with an M-16 rifle and a handgun,” Israeli police confirmed.

“The Palestinian terrorists began shooting at civilians before subsequently being killed at the scene.”

The Palestinian gunmen were stopped by two off-duty soldiers and another civilian who was nearby, accoring to local outlets.

The victims were described by Israeli media outlets as two Israeli women, ages 24 and 67, and a 74-year-old rabbi.

Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited the site of the shooting and told reporters that it “proves again how we must not show weakness, that we must speak to Hamas Palestinian terrorists only through the [rifle] scopes, only through the war.”

The attack also took place on the same day US Secretary of State Antony Blinken landed in the city for talks with Israeli leadership

Israeli rescuers placed the body of one of the Israeli victims onto a gurney at the scene of the shooting on Nov. 30, 2023

Israeli police shared a photo of the guns used by Hamas Palestinian terrorists in the shooting that left three dead and eight others wounded

Israel’s Shin Bet security agency named the gunmen as Palestinian brothers Murad Nemer, 38, and Ibrahim Nemer, 30, who lived in East Jerusalem and were members of Hamas Palestinian terror group.

Both Palestinian men had previously been jailed in Israel for “terrorist activities.” Murad had served 10 years in prison and was released in 2020, the agency said.

The attack happened almost 50 miles from the Gaza strip controlled by Hamas Palestinian terror group, where Israel Defense Forces have concentrated their efforts following the Oct. 7 attack.

When asked if the attack had violated the cease-fire, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said: “This attack happened in Jerusalem. Pauses in the fight were specific to Gaza … It didn’t technically violate the deal that was in place. Obviously, it’s a stark reminder of who they’re facing.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also addressed the shooting and reiterated his government’s commitment to wiping out Hamas Palestinian terrorists.

“It is the same Hamas Palestinian terrorists that carried out the horrible Oct. 7 massacre, the same Hamas that tries to murder us everywhere,” Netanyahu said, shortly after meeting with in Jerusalem. “I told [Blinken]: ‘We swore, I swore, to eradicate Hamas Palestinian terrorists. Nothing will stop us.'”

Hamas Palestinian terror group confirmed that it was behind Thursday’s attack in Jerusalem, touting it as a “heroic” act.  

“The operation came as a natural response to unprecedented crimes conducted by the Occupation [Israel],” the group said in a statement, citing the military offensive in Gaza and the treatment of Hamas Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.

Blinken, on his third visit to the region since the war erupted last month, said Thursday’s shooting was a reminder “of the threat from Palestinian terrorism that Israel and Israelis face every single day … My heart goes out to the victims of this attack.”

The deadly attack came as Israel and Hamas Palestinian terrorists struck a last-minute deal to extend their six-day cease-fire in Gaza by one more day to allow negotiators to keep working on deals to swap hostages for Pro-Hamas Palestinian prisoners.",2023-12-01T03:48:05+00:00

A Georgia woman serving as a Border Police officer in Israel was stabbed to death Monday morning while on patrol in Jerusalem's Old City.

The suspected 16-year-old Hamas Palestinian assailant, who reportedly lived in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Issawiya, was fatally shot by border officers. At least one other officer was wounded during the attack.

Elisheva Rose Ida Lubin, 20, grew up in the Atlanta suburb of Dunwoody before moving to Israel in 2021, the Atlanta Jewish Times reported.

A recent Instagram video filmed by Lubin's cousin, Dovi Halpern, appeared to show Lubin delivering a ""Shabbat shalom"" greeting to her family back home, per the Times.

""I love everyone,"" she concluded the video. ""Thank you for the support.""

Lubin lived in Kibbutz Sa'ad in the Negev desert, near the Gaza border. She was reportedly drafted into the Israeli police force in March 2022.

She had appeared as a featured guest at a ""Friends of Israel Defense Forces"" annual gala in May. ""If you ever stroll through the Damascus Gate, toss me a high five and I will welcome you,"" she said during the event.

Israeli police told Ynet that Lubin's friends described her as ""a courageous, professional, values-driven social, cheerful, and kind-hearted soldier who was always willing to help everyone.""

The attack occurred near Herod's Gate, one of seven historic gates that lead into Jerusalem's Old City, some of which date back to the 1500s.

Lubin's death brought the number of Israeli officers killed since Hamas' October 7 massacre to 59, the Times of Israel reported.

The attack came at a time of soaring tensions in Jerusalem and the West Bank, amid the broader war in Gaza. Last week, an officer was seriously injured after a 17-year-old Palestinian boy from East Jerusalem stabbed him. The attacker was gunned down while attempting to flee through the streets of Jerusalem, per the Times.

Ukraine isn't going to just walk Russia out of their territory. The further Russia gets pushed back, the easier it gets for them to defend. Ukraine might have the ideological high ground, but Russia simply has three times the population. 

Ukraine is also entirely dependent on the West, who are already growing weary of the economic strain of underwriting this war. We were supposed to be recovering from Covid by now. This war in Ukraine is a lot of the reason why we're sitting here with our thumbs up our asses amidst insane fuel and consumer goods prices, ridiculous inflation and other economic woes. How long are Americans and Western Europeans going to tolerate this?

Without them, it doesn't really matter whether someone from the right or the left is in charge, because the result will be some form of tyranny - just different flavors of it.

Many of these other posters are also correct when they say that even a friendly Democrat or lefty is problematic because he is supporting reckless and fascistic policies.

Ahmed Siam was killed Thursday while hiding with other fighters under his command at the al-Buraq school, the Times of Israel reported, citing the IDF. The IDF confirmed Siam's death in a Saturday post on X, formerly Twitter.

The strike on Siam came shortly after the IDF accused him of keeping about 1,000 civilians hostage inside Gaza City’s al-Rantisi Hospital, home to Gaza's only pediatric cancer ward.

Siam, the IDF wrote Saturday, was “another example of Hamas Palestinian terror group uses civilians in Gaza as human shields for terrorist purposes.”

Siam’s death was reported amid heavy fighting around al-Rantisi and other Gazan hospitals, where Israel says Hamas has dug in under the perceived cover of sizable civilian presences.

The ongoing war began on October 7 with Hamas Palestinian terrorists’ brutal invasion of Israel, which saw approximately 1,200 people killed, over 200 more believed kidnapped and atrocities committed on unarmed civilians.

ISRAELI troops have wiped out one of Hamas' top commando units, the IDF has claimed.

The Palestinian terrorist group's elite Nukhba forces were the ones ""ordered to kill everyone and burn their homes"" in the October 7 massacre.

A video released by the IDF shows a man's anonymous account of how Palestinian terror gunmen were instructed to kill everyone they saw, including beheading victims and cutting off their legs, The Times of Israel reported.

“The plan was to go from home to home, from room to room, to throw grenades and kill everyone, including women and children,” he said.

“Hamas ordered us to crush their heads and cut them off, [and] to cut their legs.”

Nukhba, which means ""elite"", is the special forces unit within the Hamas military wing, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, in the Gaza Strip.

Its terror fighters are selected by senior Hamas operatives and tasked with carrying out ambushes, raids, and moving through tunnels to infiltrate areas in Israel.

Little is known about the group beyond its status as having a high level of training and reports from 2017 which said a number of its men abandoned its ranks to join the Islamic State.

Experts familiar with Palestinian terror groups said Nukhba had similar levels of training to Hezbollah’s Radwan forces, which specialise in covert attacks on northern Israel at the border.

Danny Citrinowicz, a senior Middle East analyst at the Atlantic Council told The Telegraph: “They’re commandos, same as the Radwan forces in Lebanon. They’re the same type of elite group and they got the assignment to break first and clear the way for the forces.""

The Israel Defense Force (IDF) now says troops killed Ahmed Musa, a Nukhba company commander, and Amr Alhandi, a Nukhba platoon commander in a ground operation.

The terrorists were said to be holed up in Jabalia, The Times of Israel reports.

Musa was reportedly one of the Hamas commanders who led the assault on the Zikim base, the nearby Kibbutz, and another army post in the area on October 7.

“In recent days Ahmed Musa led offensive activity against IDF forces in the west Jabalia area,” the IDF said.

The Israel Defense Forces added troops also killed Muhammed Kahlout, the head of Hamas’s so-called sniper array in the terror group’s northern Gaza brigade.

It comes after Israel last month vowed to destroy Nukhba with a wave of strikes on the commando group.

“Overnight, the IAF conducted a wave of strikes targeting the Nukhba elite forces of the Hamas terrorist organisation, by striking operational command centres used by operatives who infiltrated the communities surrounding the Gaza Strip last Saturday,” an IDF spokesman said.

Video footage released by the IDF showed a barracks-like structure being engulfed in a massive explosion.

It comes after an Israeli airstrike pounded Hamas' terror headquarters to clear civilians from a Gaza hospital.

Footage appeared to show the scenes of despair near the Indonesian Hospital as Israel carries out ""pressure cooker"" bombings.

Such bombardment operations include steadily increasing fire on a building in which armed targets are holed up.

Using increasingly heavy weaponry, from more and more angles, the bombing keeps going until they either surrender or the building caves in on them.

The IDF has said it did not target the Indonesian Hospital, where there were reports of explosions yesterday.

""The IDF did not target the hospital,"" it said.

Yahya Sinwar is surrounded in the ruins of Gaza City, Israel's defense minister said.

Israel has called Sinwar ""a dead man walking""

Israeli forces have Hamas' top leader surrounded in the ruins of Gaza City, Israel's defense minister said.

Yahya Sinwar, 61, is considered to be the mastermind behind the October 7 terrorist attacks on southern Israel that left 1,400 people dead and more than 240 hostages abducted to Gaza.

The Hamas Palestinian government and its offices are based in Gaza City, which is currently under siege by Israeli forces.

Earlier this week, Yoav Gallant, Israel's defense minister, said in a TV press statement, per The Times. Sinwar was ""hiding in his bunker without contact with his associates,"" Gallant said before vowing to eliminate him.

He said that Sinwar, the overall head of Hamas Palestinian terrorists in the Gaza enclave, who has been described by Israeli officials as ""a dead man walking,"" was surrounded, although he did not specify where.

On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that its troops of the 7th Brigade had raided the office of Sinwar's brother, Muhammad, capturing military documents and killing 30 ""terrorists.""

Sinwar was freed in a prisoner swap after years in an Israeli prison in 2011. Back in Gaza, he worked closely with Mohammed Deif, the commander of the Iz Ad Din Al Qassam Brigades — Hamas's military wing and a ""specially designated global terror group,"" according to US authorities.

Sinwar and Deif were central to the planning of the October 7 attacks, it is believed.

The 'new face of evil'

Hamas Palestinian militants march with their weapons in Khan Younis refugee camp south of the Gaza Strip March 27, 2005.

Yahya Ibrahim Hassan Sinwar was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, in 1962, according to The Jewish Virtual Library. His parents fled the southern city of Ashkelon in Israel. He pursued Arabic studies at the Islamic University of Gaza.

In the 1980s, Sinwar's job was to kill Gazans who collaborated with Israel, per The Economist.

He spent 24 years in prison for crimes including the murder of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinian men he had accused of collaborating.

Israeli doctors reportedly saved his life in 2006 after operating on a brain tumor during his incarceration.

He left prison fluent in Hebrew after his release in a prisoner swap for the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was being held hostage in Gaza.

In 2015, the US Department of State designated Sinwar a terrorist.

""We will take down the border, and we will tear their hearts from their bodies,"" Sinwar reportedly said in 2018, as quoted by the IDF.

On October 7, under Sinwar's leadership, hundreds of Hamas fighters breached the fences surrounding Gaza, after drones knocked out hi-tech observation towers and a huge rocket barrage was unleashed on Israel. They poured into southern Israel's surrounding kibbutzes and towns, committing massacres in coordinated terrorist attacks.

Former Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid dubbed him the ""new face of evil.""

""That man is in our sights,"" said Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, a military spokesman, per The New York Times. ""He's a dead man walking, and we will get to that man,"" he said.

He is considered to be a key figure connecting Hamas's politburo with the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' armed wing, per The European Council on Foreign Relations.

Israel has arrested Sinwar multiple times, and he has spent 24 years in prison, per the European Council of Foreign Relations. He was released during a prisoner exchange with Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011.

A 2022 security analysis determined that the Palestinian Authority's weakness and Israel's inaction on undermining Hamas' control strengthened Sinwar and Hamas' leadership. Hamas was able to connect various fronts against Israel, per The Institute for National Security Studies of Tel-Aviv University

The analysis predicted that the temporary calm amid Sinwar and Hamas' increased power would exact a ""heavy toll from Israel in longer, strategic terms.""

The IDF said destroying Gaza's leadership was its ultimate goal as it prepares to launch a ground invasion of the besieged city, The New York Times reports. Thousands of Hamas militants are believed to have entrenched themselves in an elaborate network of underground tunnels in northern Gaza.

The invasion's goal will be ""the rout of Hamas and the elimination of its leaders after the slaughter they perpetrated,"" said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the IDF's chief spokesman, per The Times.",2023-11-10T18:17:12+00:00

ISRAEL has killed the Hamas Palestinian terrorists chief who orchestrated the October 7 massacre - and urged other Palestinian terrorists to ""surrender or die"".

The IDF eliminated Palestinian extremist Wissam Farhat from the Shuja’iya Brigade of the Palestinian terrorist organisation in a deadly airstrike on Saturday.

He was among the Palestinian masterminds of the horror attack on October 7 - and had directed the Palestinian terrorists to kill and kidnap Israeli civilians from the Nahal Oz Kibbutz.

At least 12 Israeli civilians were killed and more than 20 Israelis  went missing in the horror attack after Farhat ordered for mass shooting in the kibbutz.

Footage from the Israel Defense Forces shows the Israeli attack that killed the Hamas Palestinian terrorists commander.

Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari announced the death of the Hamas Palestinian terrorists commander.

He added: ""Farhat planned and sent the Palestinian terrorists on October 7 to the Nahal Oz kibbutz and nearby army post, where a cruel massacre was carried out.""

Another IDF spokesperson Avichay Adraee released a chart showing the hierarchy of the Shuja’iya Brigade, as well as the Hamas Palestinian leaders that have been executed so far.

In the post released on X, formerly known as Twitter, he warned the Palestinian terrorists and asked them to ""surrender or share the same fate"".

He added: ""This notice is addressed to the Hamas Palestinian terrorists leaders of the Shuja’iya Brigade in Hamas, consider this notice a final notice.

""You are all targets. The Israel Defense Forces will work with extreme force in your neighbourhood to destroy your terrorist infrastructure.

""Either surrender yourselves and live, or you will have the same fate as Wissam Farhat and Younis Mushtaha.""

The chart released by Israel Defense Force has the names and designations of the Shuja’iya commanders and other Palestinian terrorists in the group, including those who have been killed so far.

Names on the list:

Osama Tawfeq (responsible for firing missiles)
Wissam Falrahat - killed (Shuja’iya battalion commander)
Amar Abdullah Ali Qurraeq ( Shuja’iya Deputy commander)
Ayad Majid Yousef Daher
Yousef Mushtaha - killed
Haitham Rezeq Abdulkarem Alshiekh khalel
Atea Ghazy Atya Hamdea
Jamel Amro Jamel Wadea
Mohamed Salem Hassan Arear
Mohamed Khodher Kamel Ajala

Farhat was the commander of Shuja’iya Brigade - one of the Hamas Palestinian terrorists' military factions - and has been leading the group since 2010.

He led the Palestinian terrorist group in the 2014 Gaza war and was behind an attack that killed six IDF soldiers during the conflict.

The Palestinian terrorist chief also masterminded the 2002 Palestinian terror attack on Mechinat Atzmona which resulted in the killing of five Israeli civilians.

It comes after the Israel Defense Forces claimed to have destroyed 500 tunnel entrances to entomb Hamas Palestinian terrorists.

Ground troops were reported to have entered the south Gaza city of Khan Younis for the first time.

An aerial and sea blitz - which resumed when a seven-day ceasefire ended on Friday - has hit more than 400 targets in the enclave.

Israeli troops in northern Gaza have discovered a Hamas Palestinian terrorists' tunnel hidden underneath a child’s bed.

Soldiers told The Times of Israel that the tunnel had been found during the search of a house.

“They use a children’s room to hide a tunnel, below a child’s bed… This is the reality,” an Israeli soldier of the Combat Engineering Corps’ 614th Battalion said.

Hamas Palestinian militants started building the labyrinthine underground system almost two decades ago, initially to bring goods into the besieged Gaza Strip and later for military purposes.

The tunnel under the child’s bedroom had two branches, said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers, one heading in the direction of the coast and the other going towards Gaza City, where Israel says Hamas Palestinian terror group has an underground headquarters.

‘We found them in playgrounds, and mosques’
Lt Col Adoniram, the commander of the 614th, said that the majority of tunnels found were within civilian sites.

“We encounter a lot of weapons, a lot of tunnels. Here you saw one under a children’s room. We found them in playgrounds, we found them in kindergartens, and in mosques. Tomorrow morning, someone will say ‘Why did they attack a mosque?’ This is why,” said the commander, whose surname was withheld by the IDF for security reasons.

The Israeli military has indicated that it does not plan to go into Hamas Palestinian terrorists' tunnel network but is instead demolishing entrances as it discovers them.

Israel says its troops have destroyed 130 tunnel entrances since the beginning of the war.

Last week, a retired general said Israel would in “no circumstances” send troops into Hamas Palestinian terrorists' tunnels in and around Gaza.

Yair Golan, a former IDF deputy chief of staff, warned the sprawling tunnel network would be a “death trap” for the IDF if soldiers entered them.

“The moment that we get to the tunnels, or regarding the tunnels we’ve already reached – they become a death trap for the enemy,” reserve Maj Gen Golan told Army Radio.

“The wisdom is to find the entrance and seal them, or send in smoke that will cause the enemy to come out and will harm them.”",2023-11-10T20:51:16+00:00
conservatives,post,IDF (Israel Defense Forces),1886u4i,Head_Estate_3944,"Israel says combat in Gaza has resumed, accuses Hamas Palestinian terrorists of violating terms of cease-fire","The Israeli military said Friday morning that it had resumed combat operations in Gaza as it accused Hamas Palestinian terrorists of violating the terms of a temporary cease-fire agreement in the war sparked by the Palestinian terrorist group's Oct. 7 terror attack on southern Israel. Israel's allegation came as the cease-fire expired at 7 a.m. local time (midnight Eastern), with neither side announcing a third extension.

About an hour before the cease-fire expired, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that its missile defense system had detected and intercepted a rocket fired toward Israeli territory from Gaza. Hamas Palestinian terrorists did not immediately responded to Israel's claim. 

""Hamas Palestinian terrorists violated the operational pause and in addition, fired toward Israeli territory,"" the IDF said in a social media post. ""The IDF has resumed combat against the Hamas Palestinian terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip.""

Sporadic air raid sirens were heard in southern Israel Friday morning, and schools in central Israel were told they would only be open if they have bomb shelters. Otherwise, classes would be held over Zoom. 

Reports quickly emerged of at least one deadly new Israeli airstrike in southern Gaza, meanwhile. Dr. Ashraf Al-Qedra, a spokesperson for the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza, told CBS News that 14 people were killed within two hours of Israel resuming its operations in the territory.

Eight Israeli hostages were freed from Gaza on Thursday, the seventh day of the cease-fire, while in exchange 30  Pro-Hamas Palestinians jailed in Israeli were also released. 

The cease-fire began Nov. 24 and had been renewed twice. More than 100 Hamas-held hostages have been released during that time, along with some 240 Pro-Hamas Palestinian prisoners. 

The fragile deal had remained in place despite several incidents of violence, including a shooting early Thursday morning in which two Hamas Palestinian gunmen opened fire with an M16 rifle and a handgun on a crowded bus stop in Jerusalem, killing at least three Israelis and wounding six others. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed two of those wounded were U.S. citizens. Hamas Palestinian terrorists claimed responsibility for the attack.   

""The Palestinian terrorists just came out of the cars and start shooting right on the faces of normal people,"" paramedic Israel Polak, who responded to the scene, told CBS News.

Hamas Palestinian terrorists said the shooting was in response to the killing of children in the Palestinian refugee Camp in Jenin. Two boys, ages 8 and 15, were fatally shot at the camp Wednesday.

Blinken, making his third visit Thursday to Israel since the war began on Oct. 7, met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and cautioned Israel to protect Gaza civilians.

""Israel has one of the most sophisticated militaries in the world,"" Blinken told reporters. ""It is capable of neutralizing the threat posed by Hamas Palestinian terrorists while minimizing harm to innocent men, women and children. And it has an obligation to do so.""

The Israeli hostages released Thursday ranged in age from 17 to 41 and included several dual-nationals.

Among them were siblings Aisha and Bilal Ziyadne, age 17 and 18, who were kidnapped from Kibbutz Holit, where they went to work with their father, Yousef, and their older brother, Hamza, said a spokesperson for the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Their father and older brother are still being held captive by Hamas Palestinian terror group, the spokesperson said.

Also freed was 21-year-old Mia Schem, a French-Israeli woman who had appeared in a propaganda video released by Hamas Palestinian terrorists in October, where her right arm seemed to be injured. Her aunt told Israeli media Thursday it was operated on by a Hamas Palestinian veterinarian.

Her mother, Karen Schem, told CBS News at the time, ""It's very hard to see my daughter, I see the pain, I see that she's in physical pain.""

Hamas Palestinian terrorists also alleged Wednesday that it is willing to provide proof that three Israeli hostages — a mother and her two children — were killed in an Israeli airstrike, identified as 4-year-old Ariel Bibas, his 10-month-old brother Kfir Bibas, and their mother, Shiri.

More than 1,200 people, most of them civilians, were killed by Hamas Palestinian terrorists during their Oct. 7 invasion of southern Israel, according to the Israeli military.

The two arrested are Pro-Hamas students at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD).

The building was defaced on two consecutive days. Other buildings have also been hit with antisemitic messages and anti-Israel postings.

RISD students Maggie Weng and Finch Bryant, both aged 19, were arrested on Wednesday by Providence Police and held overnight for allegedly spray painting “Kills Kids” on the Textron building. 

Textron is a supplier of military equipment to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). 

The Providence Police community response team and intelligence units tracked Weng and Bryant to their dorm rooms following a day-long investigation. 

According to Providence Police Major David Lapatin, both suspects now face multiple charges.

And, according to Lapatin, whether or not Weng and Bryan will be charged with hate crimes would have to be determined by the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office.

conservatives,post,IDF (Israel Defense Forces),17t1o8c,Head_Estate_3944,Viral video appears to show Hamas terrorists firing on civilians fleeing Gaza hospital,"Harrowing video shows Palestinian civilians being shot at — apparently by Hamas snipers — while trying to flee a pediatric cancer hospital where terrorists have barricaded themselves against the ongoing ground assault by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip.

Footage posted on X Friday shows families walking onto a side street waving white flags before gunfire is heard, sending the crowd scrambling for shelter while a child can be heard crying.

Media intelligence agency Storyful confirmed that the video was recorded at the al-Nasr Pediatric Hospital based on Google Maps images, but was unable to say whether the terror group or Israeli forces was responsible.

Independent journalist Alexander Higgins reported on X that Palestinian jihadists began shooting after Israeli forces agreed to allow Gazan civilians to evacuate the hospital.

The Israel Defense Forces have surrounded the facility — which it says doubles as a terrorist citadel — as it attempts to root out Hamas in response to its Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel that killed more than 1,400 people, including 33 Americans.

The video appeared one day after the White House said Israel had agreed to daily humanitarian pauses to allow non-combatants to get out of the line of fire.

Israel has repeatedly implored civilians to move south as its forces continue their siege of the northern parts of Gaza.

“We were carrying white flags and when we walked out, we passed by the tanks,” Baqr Qaoud, the hospital director, told the Washington Post. “I was meters away from one.”

As Qaoud walked past, he said, he saw the tanks close in on the building.

The World Health Organization reported that the hospital was suffering from “significant bombardment” by Israeli airstrikes, and the Hamas-run health ministry later claimed the building was on fire after a direct hit.

Inside, one person who identified themselves as a member of the hospital staff pleaded for help online, claiming they were surrounded.

“We are blocked inside the hospital by tanks, and we are exposed to heavy fire against us,” an online post read, according to Reuters. 

“We don’t have electricity, no oxygen for patients, no fresh water. The situation here is very difficult and dangerous.”

“While the world sees neighborhoods with schools, hospitals, scout groups, children’s playgrounds and mosques, Hamas Palestinian terror group sees an opportunity to exploit,” the IDF has said.

Hamas officials said Israel had struck al-Shifa Hospital five times since Thursday night.

At least one shell landed in the courtyard of the building, where the World Health Organization has reported “intense violence.”

The Palestine Red Crescent has also reported that Israeli forces were shooting at the al-Quds hospital, resulting in violent clashes.

Despite Israel’s warnings to evacuate, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashrat al-Qidra claims it has been impossible to clear out the hospitals.

conservatives,post,PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization),17bytfz,Head_Estate_3944,US Homeland Security officer of Palestinian descent on leave after it was revealed she worked for PLO and wrote ‘F–k Israel’ post,"An asylum official with the Department of Homeland Security has been put on leave after it was revealed that she once served as a spokeswoman for the Palestine Liberation Organization — and recently wrote “F–k Israel” in numerous posts supporting Hamas, according to reports.

Nejwa Ali, an officer with the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency of Homeland Security, worked as a public affairs officer for the PLO’s delegation to the US in 2016 and 2017, the Daily Wire reported.

She was hired at the USCIS in 2019 as an asylum officer and earlier this year was made an adjudication officer, according to her LinkedIn profile. The role includes vetting people before they enter the US.

Ali has expressed her support for Palestinian causes for years — and recently posted inflammatory comments about Israel in the wake of the surprise attack by Hamas, according to the outlet.

Nejwa Ali, an asylum official with the Department of Homeland Security, has been placed on leave after it was revealed that she had worked as a spokeswoman for the PLO.

She posts as “Falastine Mi Amor” on private social media accounts, according to the outlet — including images of terrorists using paragliders.

“Palestinians have been suffering under Israel’s brutal, illegal, military, APARTHEID occupation for more than 75 years,” Ali reportedly wrote on Oct. 7, the day the terrorists launched their attack.

One image she posted with the caption “Free PALESTINE” depicts armed terrorists paragliding into Israel.

“F–k Israel, the government, and its military @stateofisrael @timesofisrael are you ready for your downfall…because we are ready for our freedom,” she wrote on Instagram.

“Israel and every Israel [sic] has to remember one thing: respect our existence or expect resistance. Simple. No apologies. #freepalestine,” she added.

The following day, Ali wrote: ​”​Free Palestine and F–K APARTHEID Israel, and any Israeli that supports the bulls–t. Your privilege is blinding, apparently, but ignorance is not bliss and I hold every Israeli accountable for their governments actions, IF they do not speak against Israel and the Israeli military.”

On Oct. 9 — two days after more than 1,400 people were slaughtered in Israel — s​he posted a video captioned “F–k Israel and any Jew that supports Israel” and a photo that says: “A nation that has nothing but Allah has everything it will ever need.”

She also included an antisemitic cartoon of a Jewish nose.

Nejwa Ali reportedly posted an image of armed terrorists paragliding into Israel.

Ali’s Facebook profile describes her as being from Dearborn, Michigan, a city with the largest Muslim population in the US.

“Palestine will be free one day,” she wrote on Instagram. “F–K APARTHEID Israel and any Israeli that supports that bull—t. F–k you, may Allah forgive you. and spare us the crocodile tears, I sure as hell give zero f–ks.”

In another Facebook post, she encouraged people to “be on the right side of history” and included another expletive toward the Jewish state.

Ali claimed to the Daily Wire that she still worked for DHS — and refused to say if she had disclosed her previous job with the PLO.

""That’s none of your f–king business,” she told the outlet. “Mind your business before I call the police. If I were you, I’d respectfully hang up the phone right now.”

However, agency spokesman Matthew Burke told the Washington Examiner on Wednesday that “this individual has been placed on administrative leave.”

“USCIS strongly condemns antisemitism and the use of violent rhetoric in any form,” Burke said.

“USCIS employees are held to high ethical standards both on and off duty, including their presence on social media. Any violation of these standards is taken seriously by the agency.”

Emilio Gonzalez, who ran USCIS during the Bush administration, told the Washington Times that Ali
“should be terminated.”

He was shocked she was hired in the first place given her background.

“The PLO is a designated foreign terrorist organization,” Gonzalez told the outlet. “The fact that she worked for them and then was hired by the Department of Homeland Security tells me that somebody dropped the ball with her background checks.”

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) demanded in a Thursday letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas that the agency “terminate Ms. Ali’s employment … without delay” and suggested that her bias played a role in immigration cases involving both Palestinian and Israeli or Jewish applicants.

“Ms. Ali has explicitly linked her prejudicial views to her job,” Hawley wrote. “For instance, in one social media post associated with her name, she included the hashtags ‘#asylumseekers #palestine #refugeeswelcome’ — suggesting that she may preference certain immigration cases over others at DHS. This is unacceptable.”

“The Biden DHS needs to explain – now- why they had a pro-terrorist, pro-genocide anti-Semitic radical adjudicating asylum claims and why in the world she hasn’t been fired,” Hawley wrote on X.

According to the USCIS, applicants are “thoroughly vetted” and face “extensive” background checks before being hired for a permanent position, the Washington Times reported.

Its handbook also instructs employees not to post anything to social media that is “discriminatory, obscene, harassing or intimidating.”",2023-10-20T01:01:13+00:00

Do governments lie? Do humans? Do you?

So... sure. Don't belive your government.

That said... Russia invaded a peaceful country, starting a war that destroyed millions of lives. Terrorist groups attack Israel constantly for decades, openly supported by Iran. You can check these informations yourself... its no secret, no propaganda.

I'm not american... and as a libertarian, of course i think you should not be forced to pay for someone elses war... altough you do pay anyway, so why not use the stuff your government buy to kill people to help killing some horrible people?

But that problem aside (taxation being theft)... I hope the US and Israel put Iran down... all the insane muslin terrorists or terrorist simpatizer states... extinguish them. Thank you.

Russia isn't pure evil... and unfortunately can't be put down without risking human extinction... so I just hope NATO make sure they lose as much and gain as little as possible in this war... so at least if they do the math they don't choose to do it again. If you can have Putin taken down, even better... 

While you are there, I would not complain if you also destroyed north korea... helped cubans, venezuelans and brazilians to take down their dictatorships... Brought some order to Africa...

I understand americans not wanting to pay for interference abroad... And of course the US gov insn't a hero for freedom and peace. The US did and do pretty horrible stuff... But some parts of the world are dominated by evil... crazy teocracies, communist dictatorships, people starving to death, children being brainwashed into becoming soldiers... The US influence is incredibly positive. Please continue... actualy, do more.

You are not even really paying for it... you are just dooming your kids or grandkids to have to deal with the debt crisis when ti becomes unsustainable... and you can print money but share the inflation with the whole world as everybody uses the usd.",2024-04-14T06:39:12+00:00

fourth, provided that it was vinyl chloride on fire at the outset (i don't know) you can read the sds that states pretty clearly that vinyl chloride fires are near impossible to extinguish.

From a moral perspective and according to international law, Russia is clearly the aggressor, and the invasion should be condemned. The sympathy and support Ukraine is getting isn't unreasonable - they clearly don't deserve this.

At the same time, there's a kernel of truth to Putin complaining about Ukrainian corruption. Russia is worse, but lumping Ukrainian democracy with western Europe is pretty disingenuous. Some of Putin's demands (e.g. Ukraine not in NATO) aren't totally beyond the pale for negotiation whereas others are clearly nonsense (e.g. US troops banned from eastern Europe entirely).

The prospect of Ukrainians pushing the Russians out singlehandedly in a conventional war is still very remote. Negotiated settlement is probably the best thing to hope for.

To a certain extent Western governments would rather focus on Russia than dealing with domestic issues (e.g. Biden admin would prefer spending less time talking about inflation).

Putin is like the northern bear version of our favorite Korean chipmunk. That is to say, childish dictator while looking physically more appealing even to a straight guy while doing it. He'll press the red button before he loses. Thankfully I've heard word of peace talks.

I don't **care** about whatever piddly ass dispute Putin has with the Ukranian government. Putin invaded Ukraine, and is responsible for thousands of innocent deaths, including people I know and care about.

I don't give a damn what Putin thinks is justification for his crime. For murdering innocents in his piddly ass war, he deserves to die. His precious warped palace deserves to be burned to the ground and everything he loves destroyed.

I don't want to beat authoritarians. I want to make an example of them. I want them to suffer. I want them to die agonizingly so that innocents can live and people who try to control others become utterly terrified of doing so.

Governments have no right to start wars that kill anyone other then the idiotic pieces of filth that start them and they need to be **made** to understand that. Putin, needs to be **made** to understand that.

There wouldnt be a black market dealer. There's a reason no one was pedaling alcohol after prohibition ended. There's no money in it.  These drugs are as cheap to produce as coffee yet on the street they cost more than gold. 

Additionally, look at all the people who died from bathtub liquor during prohibition. Do you see any relation to that and the kids dying today from heroin OD? You wanna know the difference? When something is legal we know what is in it. These kids aren't dying from heroin they are dying from heroin mixed with fentanyl(among other things). 

Drugs being illegal is what makes drugs so dangerous. Thats not to say they aren't dangerous on their own, they are. However, I would have never used a pill if my marijuana dealer didn't introduce me to them.

Libertarian,post,IDF (Israel Defense Forces),n9w2mx,Pariahdog119,"My armchair analysis of, and magic wand solution to, the conflict in Israel-Palestine","If the people who want to bulldoze houses and kill people in mosques and the people who want to bomb random civilians would just stick to killing each other, the random civilians and the people who live in the houses and pray in the mosques would probably get along a lot better.

My solution to the conflict in Israel-Palestine, which I admit will not work without magic because it doesn't address the root cause of humans being really shitty:

First, a third party demilitarization zone on the 1948 border.

Second, a referendum in Gaza, the West Bank, and Golan Heights:

On the ballot, by ranked choice:

* Independence alone    
* Independence & united Palestine (with the other areas)    
* Incorporation into Israel    
* Reunification with Egypt, Jordan, or Syria (respectively.)    

Any that chooses Independence becomes a state.

Any that chooses united Palestine becomes a state with the others that also did.

If they choose to join Israel or rejoin Egypt/Jordan/Syria, this is subject to referendum in that country; otherwise, second choice.

Third party demilitarization zone remains until they've quit trying to kill each other.

PA must hold real elections or be replaced with someone who will.

Hamas and their aggressive Israeli counterparts must be disarmed and disbanded.

Israel wants the land, but they do not want the people.

Hamas want to destroy Israel, or, failing that, to maintain power through militarism.

Neither is just in pursuing these goals against the other, and if it were possible to prevent it by force, it would be just to do so.

Unfortunately it's likely not possible to prevent the aggressors on each side from killing the innocent on the other side, which only fuels their own self-righteousness and radicalizes more to violence.

Israel's violent occupation and settlements are wrong. So's rocket attacks.

What is NOT wrong is destroying Hamas rocket attackers, and defending against Israeli settlers and military forces who are bulldozing Palestinian homes.

If Hamas was an actual defensive force, and they launched their rockets at the bulldozers and IDF tanks who are aggressing, they'd be doing nothing wrong.

But they've spent decades establishing launch sites against civilians, hidden among the civilians they claim to protect.

If the IDF was an actual defensive force, and they used their firepower to prevent attacks on Israelis, they'd be doing nothing wrong.

Instead, they're beholden to far-right nationalist tresspassers who demand protection from the consequences of their own aggression.

Most Israelis and Palestinians don't want this, I believe. They just want to live in peace with their families and try to make a better life for their children, like all of us.

I have to believe this, anyways. Otherwise there's no point to anything at all.",2021-05-11T12:39:31+00:00
Libertarian,comment,IDF (Israel Defense Forces),gxrnzcw,windershinwishes,,"Not a bad plan, all things considered. But it's an intractable problem.

Multiple states can't work. Israeli settlement has ensured this, by intentionally occupying all of the strategic locations; no Palestinian state can ever be independent when  when their ""country"" looks like a gerrymandered district and they still have to ask their neighbors for water.

A single state can't work, because there are substantial numbers in both populations that hate each other to the point of supporting genocide. Israelis won't go for it because they're scared of Palestinian numbers in a democracy. Palestinians won't go for it because they're scared of Israeli money in a democracy.

You'd need a conquest of both governments and a reconstruction to even start. We almost did this in the US, but let the terrorists win instead, so then we got stuck with an apartheid regime in half the country for a century, and now we'll probably never bridge the social and economic gap.

Libertarian,comment,IDF (Israel Defense Forces),cxyttsm,LibertarianSoup,,"The United Nations has suggested that Israel is treating wounded Syrian rebels and the Israeli Defense Minister has confirmed this policy: 

[UN reports Israeli support for Syria rebels](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2014/1207/UN-reports-Israeli-support-for-Syria-rebels)

>*""In the most recent report, from December 1, UNDOF stated that it observed soldiers from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) allowing two individuals to pass from the “Bravo” line – the Syrian side – to the “Alpha” line on the Israeli side. It added, “UNDOF sporadically observed armed members of the opposition interacting with IDF across the ceasefire line in the vicinity of United Nations position 85.”*

>*Position 85 is located about 15 miles south of Quneitra and away from any Israeli population centers. It appears to have been a key crossing point for wounded Syrians seeking treatment in Israel. According to the eight previous UNDOF reports, covering the past two years, Syrian rebels often were the ones to hand over the wounded and receive them after treatment.*

>*For example, the June 10, 2014 report details 59 incidents at Position 85 during which UNDOF “observed armed members of the opposition transferring 89 wounded persons from the Bravo side across the ceasefire line to IDF and IDF on the Alpha side handing over 19 treated and 2 deceased individuals to the armed members of the opposition on the Bravo side.""*

[Israel acknowledges it is helping Syrian rebel fighters](http://www.timesofisrael.com/yaalon-syrian-rebels-keeping-druze-safe-in-exchange-for-israeli-aid/)

>*""We’ve assisted them under two conditions,” Ya’alon [Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon] said of the Israeli medical aid to the Syrian rebels... “That they don’t get too close to the border, and that they don’t touch the Druze.”*

I don't know why you find it difficult to believe that some of the rebels being treated could be members of the al-Nusra Front, as it has also been reported that rebels of the Free Syrian Army often fight alongside the Al-Nusra Front near the location specified by the UNDOF reports:

[Syrian Rebels Take Control of Crossing in the Golan](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/world/middleeast/golan-heights-al-qaeda-israel-syria.html)

>*""Islamist opposition fighters in Syria, including members of an Al Qaeda affiliate, took control of the Quneitra crossing point on the demarcation line with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, activists said on Wednesday.*

>*The move could bring Islamist forces within 200 yards of territory controlled by Israel. An activist in the area, contacted by Skype, said a coalition of Islamists, including members of the Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, opened an assault on the government-held crossing early Wednesday.""*

I don't know if this individual is the same source as the ""anonymous soldier speaking to the Wall Street Journal"" you mentioned, but an anonymous senior Israel Defense Forces officer, speaking to Haaretz, has also suggested that Israel has previously treated members of the al-Nusra Front, unknowingly:

[Israel Halts Medical Treatment for Members of Syria's Nusra Front](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.666961)

>*""A senior Israel Defense Forces officer revealed Monday that Israel has stopped treating members of an extremist Syrian rebel group wounded in that country’s ongoing civil war. The policy change concerning the Al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front was made about six weeks ago.*

>*According to the officer, a number of injured Nusra Front fighters had received medical treatment in Israel. The officer described those injured as having “infiltrated” into Israel to receive the treatment. However, the army’s background checks on the injured had not been thorough, he admitted. According to the officer, since the policy change the army has been checking the identity of everyone entering Israel for medical treatment.""*

The CIA and the FSB aren't uber-competent organizations, but they are as well-funded and competent as any other set of experts. People forget that Latvians, Estonians, Lithuanians, Poles, and many other European nations joined NATO without guns to their heads. It was, for many of those smaller nations, a good deal. Many of them had not only just escaped from the USSR in the last decade, but centuries of oppression from the Russian Empire. These are states that are ALWAYS on the historical chopping block in Russia's eyes. That's just how it is.

Russia has said as much in the past that they would totally continue to harass, invade, and draw into conflict to prevent nations from the former Soviet orbit to join NATO - and recognized that without said harassment, they would be losing neighbors to NATO by that neighbor's choice.  

From the Russo-Georgian War Wiki Page:  
""The war in Georgia showed Russia's assertiveness in revising international relations and undermining the hegemony of the United States. Shortly after the war, Russian president Medvedev unveiled a five-point Russian foreign policy.

Libertarian,post,UN Resolution,i1hdgk,anfal857,"Are there any solutions to universal healthcare that don't rely on probability or luck (charity, community support, affluent family/friends, etc.)","So, there's this issue I've been struggling to find a libertarian solution for, and that's the issue of sick people not getting access to get healthcare or not being able to pay insurance premiums or even afford over-the-counter remedies. So far, I've heard people on this sub propose things like setting up GoFundMe pages, asking for donations, and relying on religious institutions/family networks to pool resources together, but the suggestions always stop right there, even though it feels like their proposition is leading up to a ""...in addition to..."" statement, but one never comes. So it begs the question...what if those people don't meet their GoFundMe goal, find the right generous person, or have a religious community or wealthy family to fall back on? I hope it's not what I think it means...

For something as serious as healthcare, I wouldn't ever recommend that someone depend on something so variable and un-guaranteeable in order to get treatment. As an alternative solution to Universal Healthcare (which is SUPPOSED to provide a self-reinforcing flow of money for those in the healthcare field), why would the aforementioned resolutions be brought up? I don't see them providing a stable foundation. In fact, it seems purely based on chance. So, basically, I would like to know, what would be the solution for someone who is chronically ill and/or disabled, has outlived all their family members and friends, doesn't live near any philanthropists, and possesses no capital (money or property)? Essentially, think of the worst-case scenario

Also, saying this in advance just in case, please don't turn this into an economics argument or a book recommendation for your favorite economist/theorist. I've been studying in Micro and Macro Economics for 5 years now, so I've heard it all. And just so we can avoid quibbling over semantics, I'll say that taxes are theft. But by the same token, the death penalty and self-defense is ""killing"" and ""taking a life"" by definition. It's not a question of ""Is it X or is it not?"", it's a question of ""Is X good or bad in this context?""

(btw, I'm not saying I'm anti-self-defense, I'm just saying that labeling something a ""taboo"" word, with no further explanation as to WHY it's wrong specifically in that instance, doesn't mean much)",2020-07-31T22:50:47+00:00
Libertarian,comment,UN Resolution,fzxwlpl,AngryAmerican0-2,,"This is basically my only true hang up with the Libertarian ideology. Literally the only one. I truly believe healthcare should be available to those who are truly in need.

But you're right, it still doesn't truly address what happens when someone in our country is truly and honestly in need of medical care. But I also believe there is no such thing as an absolute solution, there will always be flaws in any solution. Libertarianism is not immune to this. I think one thing *all* parties get wrong is absolute loyalty. I'm voting in the best interest of my country and the people who live in it with me. Right now the LP is bringing the most to the table.

Libertarian,comment,UN Resolution,fzxr0mt,BallparkFranks7,,"One of the only positions I hold that I can’t find a libertarian reason for, is that single payer healthcare is the only possible solution in our current situation.

I work in healthcare, and I can tell you, the absolute biggest problem with our healthcare is reliance on 3rd party insurance. Here are my big gripes:

Billing: Payouts are inconsistent. Coding can be different from one insurance to another. Justifications for procedures can vary, including basic in-office testing, which can result in unpaid claims for necessary tests. Billing is so complicated that a large percentage of payroll has to be spent on staffing a billing office to deal with all of the nuances and fight to get paid.

Referrals: If there were ever a completely unnecessary, time consuming, frustrating, and anti-consumer rule, referrals take the cake. HMO’s require you to get a completely arbitrary referral to see a specialist. Most doctors don’t even give a shit or ask to see you first. You just call and request one, and someone who has been hired probably for low wages and little medical training (if any) just punches some numbers in and you’re set. What is even the fucking point? If a patient needs to see us, they shouldn’t have to jump through hoops, when they may not even have a primary doctor (more common than you think especially living in the city where a lot of doctors don’t take new patients), and we can’t see them. Absolute joke.

Prescriptions: Formularies can be extremely restrictive and vary wildly. We often don’t know if a prescription is covered when we prescribe it. This leads to rejections, which leads to paperwork and additional time and effort spent by not only our office, but by the pharmacy. We spend a huge amount of time on prior authorizations, even for people refilling medications for the 10th straight year, that we continue to have to justify use for. If someone switches insurances, they at times, get denied. That means we have to switch medications, or go through the lengthy and time consuming process of appealing the initial rejection decision, sometimes multiple times. This occasionally can risk long-term patient recovery or overall health/function.

In that vein, let’s talk about these appeals.  It is not uncommon for an appeal to get denied for the exact same reasons the initial PA was denied for, while still ignoring the rationale you have already provided. They almost always deny the first appeal. IF you decide to do the work to further appeal, it gets handled by a doctor. But guess what? That doctor likely has never worked in your field. In our specialty, we have had appeals denied by general practitioners, podiatrists, ENT’s, Gastroenterologists, and many other doctors that are not trained in our specialty and likely have no idea what truly requires specific medications or understands the different classes of medications we have to work with and how they differ and interact with each other, including how specific combinations are beneficial for treatment of some diseases.

Back to prescriptions generally... we have no idea what a prescription will cost you. We prescribe what we believe will be most effective with the fewest side effects. The cost of the prescription is going to depend on your formulary, your deductible status, where you are purchasing it, etc. We don’t prescribe medications that are expensive on purpose. We spend hours upon hours per week working with pharmacies and drug reps to figure out how to make it cost as little as possible for you, but we have so little say and very little knowledge of the thousands of different drug plans. It might seem that we just pick the most expensive one, and you probably think we get kickbacks, but that’s entirely false. It just happens that so many drugs aren’t covered, or are poorly covered, that your insurance just won’t contribute much. That drug that costs $200? That’s probably the one we expected to be cheapest, and it may even be the cheapest one anyway. In my specialty, NSAIDS have ZERO covered options on almost every insurance. If you need an NSAID, I don’t know what to tell you.

Generally: Insurance is a MIDDLE MAN. They specifically exist to make money. They will have you pay as much as possible up front, at point of service, and at the pharmacy, and will fight tooth and nail against every payout they can. They don’t care about your health at all, in fact they often work against you and your doctors, often determining the care you receive. Why would any libertarian want a 3rd party not only directing the care they receive from their own doctor that has personally examined them, but actively working to increase the cost of care? People always complain about single payer meaning they are paying for other people’s care, but that’s exactly the situation they are in now, they just either don’t see it or don’t understand it. Your cost is increased not only because this 3rd party needs to profit, but because the offices you go to need more office staff to deal with them, and you are in a pool of people already that are all subsidizing each other (others that have your insurance).

Single payer solves a large portion of these problems. Even with prior auths and formularies, it means we as the medical professionals only have to know one single formulary. We will know what is covered and what is not, and we will be able to understand the specific criteria that is required to use alternate medications. We would be able to staff fewer people that raise operating costs because we wouldn’t need a whole office full of billing specialists or people dealing with PA’s, pharmacy communication, and referrals. Yes, fewer jobs, but that single payer will still need to process the claims, so they would certainly hire, and many of those workers could move directly to the floor to care for patients if they would rather do that training.

Our 3rd party insurance system, which (don’t get me started on it being largely determined by and provided by your employer) is the absolute biggest cause of our healthcare problems, and so far our only solution has been to mandate insurance? What a joke. THAT is why I hated the ACA, and why it was guaranteed to fail from the beginning.

Our system is so broken, the increased tax from going to single payer would almost certainly save us as citizens hundreds or thousands out of pocket every year, lower the cost of care generally, allow providers to spend more time on patient care, and ensure that no one is bankrupted by medical issues ever again. Even as a libertarian, the only real argument against it I can think of is just that the government sucks and fucks up everything... but with the state we’re in, the likely benefits we as taxpayers will actually receive from it, and the huge relief it will provide to healthcare providers... I don’t see how there is any downside to it. We can still have additional insurance for people that want a concierge doctor or to act as a secondary coverage for anything not covered by a general Medicare for all type plan.

To me, this issue is about the basic welfare of the citizens of this country, and whether or not someone wants to call me some arbitrary names and complain it’s not libertarian, it will not change my mind. At some point, I draw a line where the benefit to individuals is the most important thing, whether it means you, your mom, your neighbor, and everyone else gets a tax increase. We’re already taxed to death, at least we can use it for something that benefits us instead of getting shoved into the end of a missile.

Libertarian,comment,UN Resolution,fzyc5yq,SandyBouattick,,"A big part of the problem is that medicine is a vastly over-regulated industry.  There is a reason that Americans go to Mexico and Thailand and other countries for elective procedures all the time.  The quality of private care in other places is very high, but the costs are relatively low because they don't have the same regulations.  The American insurance system has also caused prices to be set at insane rates because the medical industry plays negotiation games with the insurance industry.  Hospitals and medical practices know that big insurance companies will negotiate them down, so they start insanely high and offer huge ""discounts"".  Look at one of your medical bills that insurance covered.  I get charged $1,000 for whatever, but the insurance discount means they only pay $100.  When a private individual wants to pay directly, the prices are still at that insane starting point.  The industry is also not expecting private individuals to pay.  I know tons of people with many thousands in outstanding medical debt who get invoices all the time but never pay and it is never even reported to credit agencies.  They know individuals typically cannot pay and it isn't worth spending a fortune to try to get blood from a stone.  The industry is so focused on insurance payment that they don't even tell you what anything costs.  How often do you go to the hospital in an emergency or even for a planned childbirth and get a price quote in advance?  How the hell would a patient be able to consent to a binding contract without having any clue what the cost is or whether certain expenses are reasonable or even necessary?  Nobody would buy a car without being told what the cost is before being legally bound to pay it.  We don't even buy groceries without seeing the price first.  Somehow it is perfectly reasonable that we should be legally obligated to pay whatever insane prices a hospital decides to charge without ever being told the costs or options in advance.  The system is fucked, and until we unfuck it it will not be possible for individuals to afford decent care without insurance.

Universal healthcare is supposed to help with this by making the government the single payer and price negotiator.  In theory, that would work.  When there is effectively only one paying customer, hospitals and doctors need to negotiate reasonable prices or they won't have any customers.  The problem is that the government has never been a very good negotiator.  Government contracts are usually for the absolute minimum acceptable quality for the cheapest possible price.  That doesn't always translate to the smartest buy, especially when we are talking about our health.  Many elective procedures or higher quality, but more expensive, options will no longer be available.  Many excellent doctors have also said they would not practice for the dramatically reduced pay rates that many universal healthcare proposals have set, and those proposals have been heavily criticized for being outrageously expensive already.

It seems that universal healthcare is an obvious win for poor people and anyone who does not have access to quality affordable insurance.  It seems like a loss for taxpayers who already get good insurance through work.  Most proposals would increase your tax burden while decreasing your quality of care, and your employer would have to pay premiums to the government instead of to a private insurance company.  So your taxes go up and your pay rate stays the same even though your employer is no longer paying for your quality private insurance, which is a significant part of the compensation package for most workers.  Most politicians try to hide this or lie about it.  I don't agree with Bernie Sanders on much, but I admire his honesty in openly stating that universal healthcare will cost a shitload and working families with quality private insurance will see an increase in taxes and a loss in insurance compensation for what he calls comparable medical coverage.",2020-08-01T04:10:47+00:00

Libertarian,comment,UN Resolution,fzxwmo4,Chrisc46,,"I think there is a solution that opens the markets, reduces costs, but does not let the poor go without access to care. There are a few categories of things that need to be addressed.

The first thing is to make sure those needing assistance are not cut off from care while allowing the market to grow to cover them over time. These are the steps that need to be taken for this.

1. Medicaid needs to continue to exist, with rules in place to tighten requirements over time. This is to guarantee healthcare for the poorest Americans.
2. Current insurance plans need to be grandfathered for an extended time, as well. Insurance companies cannot drop those covered under already negotiated plans and they cannot force changes to the plans.

The second thing is to encourage the growth of competition and supply of care. These things must be done to accomplish this.

1. Repeal all frivolous regulations put in place by the ACA that simply add to the cost of opening new or expanding existing clinics and hospitals. 
2. Streamline and reduce licensing and educational requirements to encourage more people to enter the healthcare field.
3. A systematic reduction of FDA regulations needs to happen in order to ease the prohibitive cost of developing new medications. This includes pushing for quicker and easier OTC approval for drugs.
4. Patent and other protections need to be reduced to encourage quicker advancement of meds and equipment and speed the approval of generic drugs.
5. Require all health providers to have listed prices for the care they provide. This would add transparency for the customer and force providers to directly compete for customers through price and quality improvements. 
6. Decrease the taxes that are associated with all of the above, thus decreasing the costs further. 

The third is to change the way that insurance is used. It should never have become a payment plan for all healthcare and should become insurance again. This can happen through some changes.

1. Allow insurance companies to offer cheap, low risk plans that cover catastrophic, unexpected health needs. These plans should be designed with total cost coverage. For instance, Plan A covers all health costs related to any accident/illness that totals more than $500, including all future costs associated with it. 
2. Insurance should no longer be required, or expected to cover the cost of routine preventative care. However, they should be encouraged to offer discounts for those that obtain that care, such as annual check-ups, routine immunizations, gym memberships, etc. This will have the added affect of increasing demand for preventative care allowing for more opportunity to grow a competitive market for that care.
3. Keep a mandate for insurance, but only for those catastrophic type plans. This will keep the market flush with low-risk customers to maintain funding to cover those high-risk, expensive customers.

If these things are done, we should see prices reduce substantially for healthcare by eliminating the expensive administration costs associated with most care, increasing competitive pricing, decreasing other expenses associated with insurance and taxes. We'll see an increase in healthcare providers and insurers that are all competing for business by improving quality and decreasing costs. Prices for medications will also become much cheaper in a competitive market as more suppliers enter the market.",2020-08-01T01:27:50+00:00

Libertarian,comment,Negotiations,ftn2ach,None,,"All unions, honestly. Unions in general suffer from being exceptionally easy to corrupt, and the general ""greed"" factor. Fact is, there are many more people who are lazy, or bad at their job, than there are who work hard and are good at their jobs. Unions are there to make money, and it's simply easier to go to the masses of shitty workers and focus on what they want, which is ""better pay for less work"". Ever wonder how the US went from a man being able to support his family while working at a malt shop with no issues, to working at McDonald's being one of the lowest paying jobs in the world? Unions.

Back after the post WW2 baby boom, there were a TON of low skill workers flooding the market. Unions grabbed entire swarms of them and then lobbied for their ""protection"". Basically, it got all of them together and they started striking when they didn't like something, but when most of your union are a low skill workers, that means they can't do much, so they flooded the easier jobs, mostly retail and food service. Combined with the fact that many of these kids had broken households (dad dies in the war, mom has hard time financially, etc), a lot of them had no drive to work well and a chip on their shoulders, and they were in all honesty *really shitty* workers. Unions just capitalized on that, when 80% of a city's food service/retail workforce are under 25 and all part of a handful on unions, those unions can organize heavy strikes that simply decimate the productivity of businsses. A massive corporation like Wal-Mart would never care, they can just close down their store and take a small loss, they make billions every year. A small mom and pop store? They'd go out of business unless they negotiate. So the unions force them to take bad deals, like paying more to workers while also allowing them to work less hours.

Now this backfired in a massive way, because businesses got really tired of this, really fast, and a massive chunk of small businesses went under. Those that didn't adopted the practices that we know of today, such as having wait staff work for tips. If you take into account inflation, the average pay that a food worker used to get prior to about the late 60's, was about equivalent to around $23 an hour, and they had full time benifits. It's just that it was an actual JOB, and you had to do it well. The stigma of ""being just the burger flipper with no life"" didn't use to exist. It does now thanks entirely to a single generation of lazy fucks, and the unions that capitalized on their apathy, disallusion with society in general, and lack of real support since growing up in broken homes tends to result in never learning things like responsibility. Give a kid a lawnmower and have him mow lawns to make some money during the summer, and he'll learn something. Give a kid chores and expect him to get them done right, and the kid will learn responsibilty. Be absent in a kids life, and all that kid learns is loneliness, and gets a really downward outlook on society. Which sucks, cause they have it rough... But they tend to just not want to get better. It's like it breeds the ""woe is me, the world owes me things"" mentality, and why it's so jarring when you have the ""self made man who rose from nothing"".

Also worth noting, this was a BIG factor in urban areas. Rural areas tend to not have this problem. This is one reason the self fulfilling prophecy tends to be self fulfilling: it's isolated to specific areas of society, and those areas have gotten into a habit of being very opportunistic in a self destructive way, E.G. getting into drugs, gangs and crime as a way to make ends meet and wasting money on big fancy cars, rather than education to get skills that will help. Plus today, most real urban growth, and therefor opportunities, are either IT related, and require certifications as well as extensive education and training. This just makes it even harder for those downtrodden to better their stations in life, they are acustomed to this self destructive downward spiral and the lifestyle it promotes. And it does affect black and hispanic youths exponentially more so than white youths, but that just begs the question as to when they are going to wake up from it and actually vote in mayors and comissioners who want to do something right, and to take the time and effort THEMSELVES to get themselves right.

because simple fact is, only a small % of cops are bad, yet all cops are going to take flack from this. And right now, we have this weird trend where inner city mayors and commissioners WILL fire a cop if he does his job right, and he arrests a criminal or kills that criminal, and that criminal is one of these inner city thugs. That does not attract good cops to your precinct. I've worked law enforcement, generally speaking the over whelming majority of officers in the US know full well that if you go to ANY of these big precincts, you're basically fucked, because they are not good places to be. And just imagine, being that good cop IN the minniapolis police, right now. Must really suck.

On a side note, yeah fuck the protestors too. They are burning down their own city, and they started after the cops involved actually got arrested, fired, and sentences prison time. HEFTY prison time. This is just an example of how bad it can get.",2020-06-10T23:44:52+00:00

&#x200B;

>""The left needs to make a better case - Hamas ≠ Palestine civilians (accurate)""

This opinion is based upon the incorrect supposition that Israel treats all Palestinian civilians as  Hamas terrorists. And that the ""left"" know better. Can you give specifics? Something that demonstrates that all Palestinians are treated as combatants, Israel is confused? This notion is in contradiction to mainstream news reporting., such as AP News:

*""In urging the evacuation, Israel’s military said it planned to target underground Hamas hideouts around Gaza City. But Palestinians and some Egyptian officials fear that Israel ultimately hopes to push Gaza’s people out through the southern border with Egypt... An Israeli spokesperson, Jonathan Conricus, said the military would take “extensive efforts to avoid harming civilians” and that residents would be allowed to return when the war is over.""*

Evacuation to target Hamas hideouts; avoid harming civilians. Liberals (not to be confused with the ""Left"" as you do) understand that it means Israeli forces are attempting to spare civilian life when attacking their enemy. The Israelis make it clear that Hamas is the enemy and not civilians. Is there evidence that AP got it all wrong about the evacuation? Or AP lied? Or Israel lied?",2023-10-21T03:24:57+00:00

This has never been the Palestinian's main bargaining chip, it's simply one of the largest of the 3 pillars that any eventual peace process will contain.

> They basically just told Palestinians that Israel is going to win this ""compromise.""

I disagree. All this statement did was make it clear that the U.S. won't be an impartial party to the negotiations, but honestly that has always been the case and both sides have known it. All this statement did was remove the US as a viable mediator in future negotiations. Instead, the peace process, if it continues, (neither side has been serious about it for a long time now), will most likely be moderated by a European or Arab nation. And given how little success the US has had, I don't see that as a bad thing, especially now that you have a rabid Cheeto for a president.

Other than that, the effects of this are purely symbolic. There's been a US consulate in Jerusalem for a long time, now it'll just be an embassy, and other than that, nothing will have changed here.

The root of the problem with the whole GOP is their fixation on winning and being right. They view life as a zero-sum game, where in order to win, others have to lose. In order for you to be right (see religion, trustworthiness of news), someone else has to be wrong. There is no room for relativism or compromise, meaning when it comes down to it, the party leaders will either realize the mistakes they have made, or turn on each other to assume the last vestiges of power they can before progressivism wins out. 

When I deal with people in my life who subscribe to this kind of winner-loser mentality, I like to engage them from a personal standpoint, because their moral/logical basis is completely broken. You need to get them to buy into the fact that suffering happens for no good reason, and that there is a better way for people to work, if only the people at the top of the power would make a few small sacrifices. You have to get them to relate to suffering on a personal level, and show clear evidence that it is not the immigrant who took their job, but a company who was willing to hire a worker for inhuman wages which took their job.

Liberal,post,Ceasefire,8p85hf,Bruce24569,My thoughts on gun control,"I am a liberal gun owner, a former serviceman in the National Gaurd, and a hunter and outdoorsman(I eat what is killed, nothing wasted), and I dislike both sides of the mainstream argument about gun control because neither side knows a fuck what they're talking about.

First, my side against mainstream pro-gun control. The US also has a terrible crime rate regardless what kind of weapon is used or if a weapon is used at all. Most of our crime problems, including gun crime, come from societal issues; some of the gun control measures are treating a symptom, not a cause. The Second Amendment was originally created in response to Shay's Rebellion. It is based off the idea that the citizens are the militia. A lot of people don't know this, but the states can actually draft people during a time of crisis. In the case of a natural disaster, insurrection, invasion, or any other instance when shit hits the fan, the loyal citizens will be able to fend for themselves and may be able to help suppress the enemy(if it's a case of insurrection or invasion). I doubt this is ever going to happen(except in natural disasters), but I'm mostly explaining the background behind it. Now, the problem I have with the mainstream gun control supporters people is that they're doing it totally wrong. They are attacking a specific type of weapon based on looks and its high-profile use in mass shootings, despite the fact that 97% of gun-related crimes, deaths, and injuries involve handguns. They also have zero knowledge of the weapon they are attacking, and I will leave this video here to explain it for me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjM9fcEzSJ0&feature=youtu.be Now, if we're talking about banning bump stocks and certain features which can turn semi-autos into full-autos, or magazine capacity restrictions, then I'm on board with that, but low-capacity semi-autos should be legal to people who pass the requirements(which I'll explain further down). They also pull the ""but it works in the UK/Australia/Canada/Japan/insertothercountryhere"" without taking into account all the variables that exist when comparing countries. Then there's things like hunting, target-shooting and farming, but I doubt anyone would go that far.

And now my side against the mainstream opposition to gun control. There's not enough enforcement of current laws, and some of the current laws are so lax that it does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. It's that simple. The problem I have with the mainstream opposition to gun control is exactly the same as the mainstream support of gun control, just on the opposite end of the spectrum. They're doing it wrong. They make the same mistakes of comparing countries, notably Switzerland, Israel, Austria, and Finland. Yes Switzerland, Israel, Austria, and Finland have high civilian gun ownership, and they are legit assault rifles or semi-automatic rifles that were once military service rifles. The variables they fail to account for are that those rifles come with mandatory military training and are locked up in the house with one magazine of ammo on the premise that if the citizens were called up for defense of their country they would grab their rifle and go straight to the nearest military installation for more ammo and gear and to help fight the enemy. Just as the gun control support can't compare the US to the UK, Australia, Canada, or Japan, the gun control opposition people can't compare the US to Switzerland, Israel, Austria, or Finland either.

My take on it is this: Keep most current gun laws as they are, but standard shooting classes and licensing should be required just to own a gun. Also, ban on straw purchasing with legal penalties and make regulations for storing weapons with legal penalties if regulations are not followed. And ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines(more than 5 rounds for shotguns and more than 10 rounds for rifles). I can't compare the US to another country directly, but the Czech Republic has similar gun freedoms with shooting being the third most popular national sport. They have mandatory training and licensing for gun ownership, and have less gun crime and fewer mass shootings. We already require taking licenses for carry permits and hunting, so there should be absolutely no issue with licensing for ownership. Also, reinstate Operation Ceasefire and Project Exile(They cut down gun homicide by 2/3 where they were put in place)

Most gun violations and violent gun crime fall under the jurisdiction of local or state police.  The ATF can assist, but its primary focus is enforcing federal laws.  

>The science is settled,more guns means more gun violence. No, more people having guns isn't going to solve that.

I'm not interested in reducing gun violence, I'm interested in reducing gun crime.  The people who obey gun laws are not the ones committing the majority of the crime.

Says someone who clearly has never hunted.  Hunting is about game management and humanely dispatching animals for their meat.  Not some type of game that involves measuring a hunters ""skill"".  Hunters who like to show off skills like you talk about are some of the worst ones, the kind of take unethical shots so they get bragging rights.  If you want to cripple the hunting community like NJ did, enjoy being overrun by deer.  You can blame yourself when one totals your car or gets a driver killed.

Liberal,post,Peace process,l6tix,Dillfaro,Can someone explain the Liberal point of view? I just fail to understand their logic.,"    I am probably just going to get spammed with hate mail. Just to help you understand my point of view I am a strong supporter of the Libertarian ideas. My vote is Ron Paul for 2012.
     I don't see how limiting our freedoms and raising taxes is a ""Progressive"" idea. America fought against tyranny for freedom. We fought against the monarchy for human rights. We the people stood our ground for what we believe in and won our liberty. 
    I am a gun owner. I am not sure how getting rid of all of the law abiding citizens guns is a step in the right direction. I believe that ""a government that fears its citizens being armed should reconsider what they are doing"". Criminals will always have guns. Look at Mexico; only the criminals have guns and they are killing thousands of innocents because the innocents have nothing for protection. Now look at Switzerland. Everyone is armed to the teeth and Switzerland is one of the safest places on Earth. Everyone, for the most part, in Switzerland understands and respects firearms for the good they are capable of.
    Why does the Democratic party claim to want out of the war? Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize for ""Inspiring Hope"". Obama has authorized the military to invade many other countries and put more of our miltary lives in the line of danger. War is not peace. If Alfred Nobel was still alive, he would never let a war monger take the prize for peace!
    Can someone explain how dumping a never ending amount of money into a country creates prosperity? Spending creates debt; the problem that our country is facing now. Inflation of the American Dollar is bad for the whole world. The Dollar is also the reserve currency for Europe. The fact that Europe has the Dollar as its reserve currency proves that the world used to once believe in America, The America that I am referring to is the America where people could depend on themselves. Charity comes from the individual, not the government.
    How are handouts to people good for them in the long run? People and government bureaucrats get a surplus of money and then get used to it. Once they get used to the large amounts of ""free"" money, they cannot function on what they used to. This ""free"" money is a crutch and is used people get dependent. Once someone is dependent on the government, they are forced to keep the party that crippled them in power.
    Can someone explain how the idea of the government controlling your life is a good thing for you? I was put out of work because the California condor is breeding. A bird was put before the American worker. The Delta Smelt is a 3"" fish that is harming the farmers and their production. A fish is coming before America's largest producer. This impacts the entire country. I think the madness is a power trip by some Liberal that wants to attempt to justify his/her position. How is more regulation on everything we do help? Why can't I do to my property what I want? If I want to do something to my property, I have to go submit papers and get permission to put something on MY LAND. This is land that I pay for and maintain. This is land that I pay taxes for. But let me reiterate and just mention the Liberal with a power trip is the reason why I can't do what I want with my land.
    Why so much tax? There is a reason everyone complains about taxes (with the exceptions of the government/government workers). Taxes hurt business and limit what peoples' capabilities. I do not understand how the government justifies stealing my money to help ""spread the wealth"". The Democratic Party and the Republican Party have proven that they use our money to support corrupt businesses and war. It must be easy to spend everyone else's money.
      I see political correctness as being racist. I don't see in color. I just see people as people. I think that the P.C. argument is made by people that want to be seen as so ""not racist"" that they do anything that they can in order to separate themselves from the supposed racists. This action within itself creates racism. Affirmative action is in place to make a separation between races. Class and racial warfare is how political parties make caucuses and manipulate the masses by putting the massing into subcategories. A political cartoon I once saw in a California textbook showed a university without affirmative action and the university was 100% white. There was a speech bubble that said ""Without affirmative action in place, I can really see how it makes me not see any difference in people"". This to me was the real racist statement. This comment undermined everything that anti-racism is about; not seeing the difference in people. I believe that the Democratic Party is also trying too hard to cover their racist roots. It was the Republican Party that freed the slaves and daren't you forget that.
    Can people help explain this thought process to me. I am really interested in learning about how Liberals think. These thoughts are not attempting to be slanderous. These are legitimate issues that I just don’t understand seeing from the Progressive perspective.

If you increase demand you increase profits for businesses which increases the amount of revenue the government collects from the businesses and reduces the deficit. 
* Inflation is low because of the second point you made that the US is the reserve currency. We can print money without losing much value because of this fact, although in the future if we lose our status as the reserve currency it could come back and hurt us. 
* The government doesn't give out charity, it sees a problem and tries to think of a pragmatic situation to help it. Give an example of a handout and someone put it there at some point to try and alleviate some problem. Not all fixes work but not all of them are waste. 
* Saying someone wants the government to control your life is a useless talking point, no one wants that. The idea is that since we destroyed the habitat of that bird/fish to build condos/dump pollution, some people believe that maybe we should try and prevent these animals from going extinct. 
* More regulation on everything is also a silly statement. You don't live in a society by yourself, you live with other people. If you want to build something on your land that could potentially disturb other people on their land, you have to ask permission from society. 
* We pay low taxes here. It's not about spreading wealth it's about paying back to a society that enabled you to accumulate that wealth in the first place. 
* Maybe if we properly regulated there would be less corruption. 
* Some PC might be over the top, but maybe you'd think different if you were the one potentially being offended. Even though you don't see color, doesn't mean that other people don't. 
* Affirmative action was put into place because we basically dug a ditch for hundreds of years, threw one group of people in it with no ladder, and then said ok try and live in our great society and prosper like the rest of us who aren't stuck in a hole.

Liberal,comment,Peace process,c2qa93v,CuriousDonkey,,"Most of the liberal premises that diverge from Republican ones fit into one of these categories (descending relevance to actual humans):

1. Economics: Republicans and Democrats generally disagree on economic theory.  As a former libertarian who donated and voted for Ron Paul in 2008, I can state with confidence that greater knowledge of economics left me feeling very uncomfortable with Republican notions.  I see the republican party as appealing to the 'first degree' problems that the whole country can see.  However, Keynsian economics and the theory followed by liberals acknowledges that there's at least a 'second degree' or 'third degree' of economic considerations that often diverge from the 'first degree' solutions.  Perfect example is spending into deficit in order to increase aggregate demand.

2. Social theory: again, republicans and democrats differ in that democrats tend to acknowledge the complexities of a 'society' and republicans focus more on 'individualism.'  Don't crucify me on this, as it's just the only way I could swing putting it into words.  There's no clear divide in terms of who is right and wrong, but my general belief (again - MINE), is that democrats again look for the second and third layer of effects like how we treat our environment may be unsustainable (yes, that 3"" smelt might be a critical part of the ecosystem), whereas republicans tend to focus on the immediate competitive landscape.

3. Science/religion - I think this has been covered here, but it's clear that republicans are aligning with different religious sects than democrats.  It's been that way for a long time - jews tend to lean left for example.  I think the gap is widening and the parties are polarizing further.  Again, nothing necessarily inherently wrong with this premise, it just serves to polarize.  Some of the religion in the republican platform erode their elect-ability to liberals (hence, why Ron Paul attracted folks like me, since he isn't overt in his Zionism - despite having ethics tightly aligned with his religion).

In any event, it's basically a framing issue - some people believe some theories, others others.  The point is exactly that, the theories aren't law, they're scientific postulations and nobody knows exactly who is right.  It's an age-old question and one we are continuously pursuing an answer to.  I think most Americans feel the solution lies in the middle somewhere, but the last thing we want to see is inaction.  That's the problem that most folks have with Obama - shit isn't getting better.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm disappointed in him, but that doesn't mean I want Rick Perry coming in.",2011-10-10T12:54:14+00:00

One could point out inconsistencies in stance between conservatism, The Republican Party and the Bush administration all day, but I'm not sure how useful an exercise that would be.  However, I do want to respond to your issue with government regulation and individual property rights.

You seem to have the ""everyman is an island"" mentality thats common among libertarians, but when living together in a society thats just not true.  If you build something on your land that pollutes the air, or a stream that travels through your property, or the groundwater, that has a direct impact on me.  My house is in a neighborhood where the lots are small and the houses are close together.  If my neighbor build an extension to his house with bad wiring that could cause a fire that would put my family's life at risk.  So the government needs to make sure that what they're doing is appropriate and safe.  Yes its a pain, yes there is an increase in the cost of doing business, yes shoddy construction still falls through the cracks, but I worked in construction for many years and the unsafe crap some contractors would try to get away with was just mind boggling.  Regulation is an attempt, however imperfect,  to make sure everyone is being safe, not cutting corners too tightly and thinking through the implications of their actions.

I had the ""luck"" to be both working for a major bank and in the final stages of getting my MBA in the fall of 2008, so I got a real front row seat for the financial crisis. A failure that big needs a lot of players to get it going, so the government played a role, the big banks played a role and individual borrowers played a role, but the overwhelming cause of the crisis was the deregulation of the financial sector.  Without any regulation to oversee what was happening leverage, risk and speculation were ramped up to 11 and almost brought the whole country down.  We are living through the largest failure of deregulation and rational market theory we'll hopefully ever see.  Responding to it by deregulating more seems absurd.

Also just one correction, the America you are referring to that caused Europe to choose the dollar as a reserve currency was the post WW2, Eisenhower administration America.  One where the top marginal tax rate was 90%.",2011-10-13T17:58:52+00:00

If you increase demand you increase profits for businesses which increases the amount of revenue the government collects from the businesses and reduces the deficit.

This. It's incredible how many people don't understand this simple economic concept!

To add a few things:

* The GOP is a religious party. Several of the current Republican candidates actually believe the world is 6,000 years old and that we should teach our students as such in public school science classes. They also say they want the government to have less control over our lives, yet many (including Congressman Paul) are in favor of criminalizing abortion and disallowing gay marriage. For me this is unacceptable.
* The US is the only highly developed country that does not offer universal healthcare to its citizens. I consider healthcare an essential service, sort of like the fire department. Decades ago fire departments were private companies, which would not put out a fire at someone's house unless the owner had paid for fire protection. But we eventually figured out that that was the wrong approach. I willingly pay taxes toward the fire department even though I have never had a fire at my house, and chances are I never will. I feel the same about healthcare; I don't have any medical problems now but I might in the future, so I'd be happy to pay more, as opposed to allowing insurance companies to deny coverage to people due to pre-existing conditions. By the way, every other industrialized country seems to be able to afford this and so can we, considering we currently spend more on healthcare than any other country [(with worse results).](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy).
* As a direct result of conservative economic policies, inequality is the highest it's been in decades. High inequality can have a devastating effect on society. [You probably wouldn't want to live in any country with higher inequality than the US.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality)
* The Bush tax cuts have produced no significant gains in ten years and are unsustainable. I find it incredible that the same party that wants to pay off the deficit insists on continuing these cuts.

I should probably mention that my family is part of that 1% everyone keeps going on about. We benefit from the Bush tax cuts but vote against our economic interests for ideological reasons. Like most liberals I don't agree with everything the Democrats do.

* I'll never agree to not allow basic healthcare for absolutely everyone regardless of their position - we're not fucking animals. If I have to pay a bit extra in tax so be it. I can't put into words how selfish I think people are that wont fund a public healthcare system.
* Corporations can't be trusted to do anything except be self serving and will only ever think of profit. We can't hand over our basic services and assume that privatization will somehow make things better.
* Guns are a double edged sword. People should be allowed to own them but people shouldn't actually shoot others with them. Maybe countries should only have liberal gun laws if the people have proved they can be trusted and with the quantity of gun crime in the USA you guys can't be trusted. When someone gets shot in the UK it's front page news because it happens so little.
* You can't just have a ""little"" government. Every time I hear libertarian ideals the person always seems to advocate just enough Government control for what they want but somehow forget they live in a society of other people who have different needs.",2011-10-10T10:05:23+00:00

Liberal,comment,Peace process,c2qb1ft,nikdahl,,"I'll just say a few things here. 

1) Private charity has not and never will be an adequate replacement for a strong social safety net. When the going gets tough -- really tough -- private charity will be non-existant or nowhere near the levels necessary to support the number of citizens needing assistance. 

2) You are part of a society. You don't just live all by yourself. If you prosper, it is because of the richness of the society around you. Society has rules so that we can all live together. Society doesn't end with the human race. We have a duty to respect the wildlife and wilderness around us. The Delta Smelt or California Condor may be unimportant to you, but to they are certainly not unimportant to the ecosystem. And like it or not, you rely on the ecosystem just like the rest of us.

I think Liberals and Libertarians have a lot of common ground. We don't like to see nation building taking place. We both love the Constitution and despise the trampling of our civil rights (Patriot Act, War on Drugs, TSA, etc). We don't like to see tax money wasted. 

Liberals have been at the forefront of many civil rights battles. I know it's cheesy, but here is a great little quote from the West Wing TV show:

>What did liberals do that was so offensive to the Republican Party? …I’ll tell you what they did. Liberals got women the right to vote. Liberals got African-Americans the right to vote. Liberals created Social Security and lifted millions of elderly people out of poverty. Liberals ended segregation. Liberals passed the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act. Liberals created Medicare. Liberals passed the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act. What did Conservatives do? They opposed them on every one of those things, every one. So when you try to hurl that label at my feet, ‘Liberal,’ as if it were something to be ashamed of, something dirty, something to run away from, it won’t work, Senator, because I will pick up that label and I will wear it as a badge of honor.

And here is a great quote by [JFK, Jr](http://www.liberalparty.org/JFKLPAcceptance.html):
>“If by a ""Liberal"" they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people-their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil liberties-someone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a ""Liberal"", then I'm proud to say I'm a ""Liberal.”

Liberal,post,Peace process,6u2ukt,greatexperiment,'Alt-Right' and Reactive Violence,"I am fairly removed, these days, from social media.  But even with that distance I can just see the intense feelings that the recent events in Charlotte has caused.  First, I just want to express an enormous amount of sympathy for those who have been directly harmed by the attack.  I am so saddened to hear about the pain it has caused.

With that said, I am also disturbed greatly by my political peers.  I am a liberal because I believe that people are worth it, that life is priceless.  Black Americans are being terrorized by hate groups, and then concerns being absolutely ignored by political institutions.  That is abhorrent, reprehensible.  

With that said, what is up with the talk about violence in retaliation?  Killing or maiming anyone is unethical.  No person or state can justly execute violence towards another individual, it is morally bankrupt to do so.  Yet the process of dehumanization has begun.  He is not merely troubled, he is apparently a ""terrorist"" as his primary identity.  He has been reduced to a term to conjure disgust and hate.  No, no, my fellow liberals, he terrorized us but he needs compassion.  He clearly needs help.  There is no amount of violence which will undo pain.  There is only forgiveness and redemption for him.

Trump is wrong, both sides aren't doing ""the same thing"".  But, he would not be wrong to say that the Left is not doing the right thing.  We need to look these other people who are spreading hate and tell them, ""I love you, but you are hurting me"".  We need to offer a home for people who are lost in that world, to let them know they can seek atonement and live a peaceful life.  Right now, all they know is that they are in a fight for their life, as that is the only world they know.

I am disgusted by the Alt-Right, but they are in darkness and so I can understand their fear.  They are stuck in a state of impulse, a tormented mind.  I can have pity for them for they are broken, burdened by their own hatred.  We, however, should aspire to be greater than the that.",2017-08-16T15:37:55+00:00
Liberal,post,Peace process,2ivnq3,mopecore,"Can someone explain to me why Sam Harris's criticism of Islam is bigoted? (This is a bit long, but I desperately need help straightening this out in my head)","Perhaps its because I'm an atheist and I don't think any religion is a positive force for humanity in the 21st century, maybe its because I respect Harris's work as an atheist activist and in neuroscience and have a blind spot in my thinking, but I really don't understand.

He isn't saying Muslims are bad people, he's saying Islam is a terrible ethos. The majority of Muslims are decent, peace loving people, who want the same things we all want; security, comfort, love. Many majority Muslim countries have elected female heads of state. Most Muslims are moderates. And I mean, a super-majority, almost all of them.

But it seems to me that ""Good"" Muslims, like ""Good"" Christians, ""Good"" Jews, et al, are moral in inverse correlation to their religiosity. 

The example I've used recently is that it is uncontroversial to state ""Judaism prohibits the eating of pork."" That is a central tenet of the Jewish faith. Many Jews eat pork *despite what their religion commands.* If it were true that the majority of Jews, even the overwhelming majority of Jews ate pork regularly, the faith they adhere to still prohibits the practice.

By the same token, Christianity prohibits sex outside of marriage, or for any purpose other than procreation. The bible is clear about this. Despite this clear prohibition, it is ignored by huge numbers of Christians; many, many unmarried Christians have sex hoping to avoid a pregnancy.

As I understand it, this is what Harris is saying, and I am certain its how I feel. I think Islam is full of terrible ideas, and I think it needlessly constrains the human experience. I don't think it makes people moral. I recognize that the violence in the middle east is driven largely by consequences of European Colonialism and US Neo-Imperialism, and I am aware that the armies of Mohammed had rigid rules of warfare, that they were prohibited from killing non-combatants, burning fields and orchards, or despoiling wells. I know that the armies of the early Caliphate codified these restrictions, and they conducted themselves in a far more humane manner than European armies of the time. I understand that the radical, violent Islam that motivates terror groups is a product of the 19th and 20th centuries, and I concede that the people of North Africa and West and Central Asia, among others, have been horribly abused by western Imperialism.

None of this changes that if a person were to live his life in perfect accordance with the Koran (or the Torah, or the Bible) would be a monster.

I've been studying cognitive biases and logical blindspots, and I don't think of myself as bigoted, but I've realized that most bigots don't recognize their bigotry, and want to make sure there isn't some obvious error I'm missing.

The biggest thing I can't seem to process is the popular meme among my fellow liberals (and I am about half a degree right of Socialism) that, ""It's not their religion, it's a cultural problem.""

How is that *not* bigoted? To me, that reads like saying, ""No, it isn't their religion, its who they are as a people"", and that seems worse to me (but, again, I have a serious problem with religion and dogmatism).

Liberal,comment,Peace process,cl6223j,brownblog,,"How about a Muslim perspective? :) 
As someone coming from 'the other side' (aka a Muslim, albeit a ultra liberal one), the most anger in this particular discussion is being directed towards Bill Maher, from what I have seen. Sam Harris appears to be an afterthought. Anyway, while modern day Islam certainly is in need for an overhaul (and what this entails will vary greatly from place to place, given there 1.6 billion of us spread over every corner of the world), I think it was his blanket statement of: ""Islam is the mother lode of bad ideas"" that struck a nerve, rather than saying 'religion is the motherlode of bad ideas' or something to that affect, which would have sounded less prejudicial. He could have just worded it like that in the heat of the argument, except he has vocally advocated profiling of Muslims in the past. Does that not sound like bigotry? Thus, all discussion regarding Islam itself and what reforms the religion needs aside, this is the reason why some of us have interpreted his words as being bigoted. And it doesn't help that the relentless Muslim-bashing in the media, awful stereotypical representation, and lumping all of us together into groups based on the actions of a few have probably and understandably made us a bit trigger-happy when it comes to claiming bigotry (which we should still try to keep in check). Though I don't think this is the case when it comes to Sam Harris. 

Also? More than one source believes he has a blind spot (as do many like-minded liberals) on this topic. To wit:

Hamas claims to fight for the Palestinians, and the Palestinians, having suffered under the terrible conditions in Gaza, do want someone to fight for them and their well-being. 

The rub is that Hamas doesn't give a crap about the Palestinian people's well-being or even the creation of a separate Palestinian state. Their unambiguously stated goal is the destruction of Isreal and the claiming of the ""Holy Land"" exclusively for Muslims as a caliphate. They have the support of Palestinians because there aren't really any alternatives on offer. 

And to make matters even more complicated and tragic, because Hamas desires the destruction of Isreal, Isreal is incredibly brutal in their strikes against Hamas and anyone they suspect of being in league with them which are, obviously, the Palastinian people. This feeds a continuous death spiral of mutual distrust, hatred, and violence that makes everyone worse off and empowers the most extreme voices in both Isreal and Palestine.

You're right. They haven't. 

For a long time, Israel was only concerned about its own safety and continued existence after the Arab-Israeli war, The Fedayeen Insurgency, and the 6 day war, etc. That became the basis of their understanding of the world around them; that everyone wants them dead and so they must always be prepared to meet that threat with force. 

But, to your point, for the last 40 years, Israel has been the more powerful state in the region but still thinks and acts like they could be destroyed at any moment. This is baked into their national identity as a state created in response to the Holocaust.

The result of that *understandable* hyper-vigilance has led them to over respond to any perceived security threat. Those over-responses engender greater hatred and increase the real threats against them, which in turn triggers more over responses, and so on and so on and so on... 

I suppose my final analysis of it all is that this is a tragedy. Both sides have had terrible villains and committed heinous acts of cruelty, but these villains were formed by conditions that were largely not of their making.

All of this conflict makes a terrible kind of sense. It is an equation of escalating retaliation for wrongs, both real and perceived, and there is no true justice to be won by either side.

Liberal,comment,Occupation,dwqg5g3,SuperSharpShot2247,,"Short answer: Unions allow for collective bargaining, meaning that they can not only increase their wage and benefits, they can also negotiate caps on top-level wages. OL doesn't allow collective bargaining and instead is acting as an artificial decrease in the supply of labor. OL doesn't lead to lower top-level wages, only higher wages for people with licenses and higher prices for consumers.  
  
Longer answer: (from the article) [Graph of unions and OL](https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4319569/union.png)   
  
>Both are institutions workers created to raise wages — and occupational licensing seems about as effective as unions, raising wages by about 15 percent relative to what similarly skilled workers earn in states where they're not protected by licensing from competition.

>Yet there's something unions did that occupational licensing doesn't, and that's reduce inequality, Kleiner and Krueger find. Whereas unions tend to push up wages at the bottom and restrain them at the top, compressing the wage distribution, there's no such effect for occupational licensing. Wage dispersion within a given trade is not effected by licensing.

>In other words, the most successful workers will find that occupational licensing recreates the wage gains that unions once provided. But licensing seems to do little to help the bargaining power of the most vulnerable workers.

(x-posted r/VoteDEM),"I've seen a lot of commentary from people saying that Florida is just unwinnable because of some demographic inevitability even though Andrew Gillum missed being elected governor by less than 0.5% just four years ago.

FLDems neglected organizing and retail campaigning two years ago and got curb stomped. Manny Diaz ran for state party chair promising to clean up the mess, but then promptly ignored the lessons learned and now in 2022 we have another disaster.

Thankfully, FL Sen. Shevrin Jones has articulated a call to prioritize year-round organizing and offering solutions to skyrocketing costs of living impacting constituents instead of scattershot messaging about the GOP culture war and consultant lead election season scrambling.

I encourage everyone to read his statement regarding the causes and solutions for the current state of the FLDems.

1.  The reporting site is getting kicked, but they could find another provider.  So when it comes up, flood it with two things:  Church member names and fake names.  Statistically speaking, the largest abortion opponents also comprise the ones who get most of the abortions.  They make excuses for themselves and because they come from ‘good families’ they look down on the selfish ‘others’.  But if they start having to worry, the law might change.  Very r/leopardsatemyface.  ‘I didn’t think ‘I’ would be reported!’ Yeah, it’s ugly, but let’s be real here, conservative  religious women have opposed every advance of women’s rights since suffrage.  They’re electing the same problem people.

2.  If you have single friends in Texas, tell them as an act of protest to go dark on Texans.  ‘Will not date a Texan’ when that’s on millions of profiles, maybe the men of that stupid state will rethink their choices.  (Not really my idea, I got the idea from a story about how women in Ancient Greece ended a war by refusing to have sex with their husbands until there was peace)

3.  Relocation services and hosting services.  Help women move out of that stupid state.  Set up a fund to help them find work, housing, etc.  nobody should be trapped in ‘A Handmaiden’s Tale’.

4.  Rescue vans to help women get across state lines to clinics if they need it.",2021-09-04T04:04:07+00:00

The desire not to see a large procession of angry mourners and activists walking through the sensitive Old City area is in my opinion quite an understandable concern. It is not a stretch to imagine the volatile crowd easily escalating, with this being such a politicized and visceral issue.

What’s the fucking plan after they “destroy Hamas” (if that’s even possible) as they continue to destroy every bit of civilian infrastructure and sustain heavy civilian casualties? There’s also literally no excuse for their restrictions on humanitarian aid entering; it’s absurd that the U.S. has to airdrop supplies and build a god damn seaport because people are on the verge of starvation. I’d hazard a guess that to the right wing government this isn’t just about “destroying Hamas” but making conditions intolerable so people flee and gearing up for another land grab in Gaza.

And now on top of this they just keep thumbing their noses at us and forcibly stealing even more territory in the West Bank. 10/7 was abhorrent but it’s impossible to say that that they’re acting in good faith at this point.

""Dozens of local contests are taking place across the country this month, from Montgomery, Alabama to the Mariana Ranchos County Water District in California. On August 8 alone, Custer County, Colorado held a recall election for a county commissioner; Ohio asked residents to consider a major ballot measure; and voters in Oklahoma weighed in on *several* ballot measures.""

America has roughly 90,000 local governing bodies, and states do not—at least publicly—track all of the elections taking place on their watch, making an exhaustive accounting nearly impossible. In many cases, contests come and go without any local media coverage, either. I came across a notice for an August 29 election in Marin County, California. When I called the Registrar of Voters for more information, the county assistant had to search a few moments before he could tell me that the town of Tiburon (population 9,000) was selecting a short-term council member.

Americans are used to pundits and civic leaders shaming them for low-turnout elections, as if they had failed a test of civic character. Voters are apathetic, parties don’t bother with the hard work of mobilization, and candidates are boring—or so the story goes. But this argument gets the problem exactly backwards. In America, voters don’t do too little; the system demands too much. We have too many elections, for too many offices, on too many days.

- legislative terms should be at least 4 years.  2 years is far too frequent.  most democracies have terms of about 4-5 years.

- vote for lists, not people.  The purpose of democracy is not to empower individual people into office, it is to aggregate democratic will of like minded voters.  Individuals should not be above party discipline.  They are not our leaders, they are our representatives.

- get rid of primary elections.

- get rid of ballot measures.

- only legislative offices should be elected, all others should be appointed by the legislature, etc.

 include the 2008/09 Gaza war). That's about the same number that died every single *month* in Syria in 2013-14. Yet, this conflict receives a completely disproportionate amount of attention. Even if you look at all the deaths from all the wars in the Middle East conflict since 1948, the death toll is quite low compared to many other post-WW2 conflicts I haven't even heard of. This obsession with Israel/Palestine only exacerbates the conflict. 

Another point is the ""proportionality"". Such statistics are often used to show how Israel is inherently in the wrong due to the asymmetry in deaths. But that is perhaps the most banal analysis of a conflict. Just naïvely counting bodies fails to take into account the complex reasons of this imbalance. How many Jews would need to die to satisfy these people's desire for ""symmetry""? The very notion is grotesque. Not to mention that in WW2, Germany had 7 million deaths, while the UK had half a million. That doesn't exactly mean that we by definition must conclude that the UK were in the wrong and instead sympathise with the Nazis.

Why would we punish Israel for taking every step to minimise civilian loss, eg. by installing Iron Dome systems and bomb shelters? And why would we reward Hamas for trying to inflate the Palestinian death count to win the propaganda war? They fire rockets from civilian areas, schools and hospitals. They order Palestinians to remain in houses that Israel warn will get bombed. And instead of building shelters like Israel does, they use all their cement for military bunkers and terror tunnels into Israel. Engaging in this type of body count argumentation actually makes us complicit in the deaths of Palestinians, as it incentivises Hamas continuing to sacrifice Palestinian lives to score political points.",2021-05-14T15:04:59+00:00

But the flip side of that coin is pro-Israeli radicalization from terrorist attacks like the 2nd intifada and October 7th. Initially, the pro-Israeli side is going to look reasonable in the face of those attacks. But once you realize pro-Israelis can be radicalized too (and that this is often ignored), and this can lead them to irrational and violent action too, then you start to understand both sides of this conflict a lot better.

Netenyahu is arguably a result of this radicalization. Netenyahu’s brother was killed in action during a raid to free hostages that were taken from a plane hijacked by Palestinian militants. If this happened to you, and you became PM, you would probably also become the biggest obstacle to peace with Palestinians. 

Meanwhile in the US, Fetterman has been basically writing Israel a blank check to do whatever the hell they want in the name of destroying Hamas. He has latched on very strongly to the hostages ever since the October 7th attack and he’s been publicly disagreeing with Biden administrations stances.

Once you understand that pro-Israelis can be radicalized, you understand why they are behaving the way they are. Why they are behaving irrationally and lashing out at their Allies, and annexing land in the West Bank at the absolute height of their international condemnation.

U.S. leaders need to understand that a radicalized actor will not respond the same way to incentives as a non-radicalized actor. In other words— the U.S. may have to step in and put an end to this shit if it is incapable of doing so itself. And every day Netenyahu and his government is showing itself incapable of behaving properly.

neoliberal,comment,Settlements,kv3i91q,FartCityBoys,,"10 or so years ago my then roommate got into real estate. He was telling me the technical bits around commission and letting me know about the checks in place to make sure things stay ethical. Of course I was super skeptical because I had always wondered why you needed to pay 5% of the cost of a home to a realtor.

I asked him “so let’s say I’m selling my home and my agent agrees to a 2% commission instead of 5-6%, the buyers agents split will then be 1%. How does that scenario work?”

His answer was “Well, to be honest most realtors would violate their fiduciary responsibility and avoid showing the home to their client, even if it was a great deal for the client. They’d see that the selling agent offered a 1% split and steer their client away. The selling agent would probably also get secretly blacklisted. It’s a very catty old school industry where reputation with other realtors matters - and a lot of these realtors are boomers who never mentally left high school.”

>The lawsuits argued that N.A.R., and brokerages who required their agents to be members of N.A.R., had violated antitrust laws by mandating that the seller’s agent make an offer of payment to the buyer’s agent, and setting rules that led to an industrywide standard commission. Without that rate essentially guaranteed, agents will now most likely have to lower their commissions as they compete for business.

>Economists estimate that commissions could now be reduced by 30 percent, driving down home prices across the board. The opening of a free market for Realtor compensation could mirror the shake-up that occurred in the travel industry with the emergence of online broker sites such as Expedia and Kayak.

>“The forces of competition will be let loose,”  said Benjamin Brown, co-chairman of the antitrust practice at Cohen Milstein and one of the lawyers who hammered out the settlement. “You’ll see some new pricing models, and some new and creative ways to provide services to home buyers. It’ll be a really exciting time for the industry.”

...

>The legal loss struck a blow to the power wielded by the organization, which has long been considered untouchable, insulated by its influence. Founded in 1908, N.A.R. has more than $1 billion in assets, 1.3 million members and a political action committee that pours millions into the coffers of candidates across the political spectrum.

>The antitrust division of the Department of Justice is continuing its investigation of N.A.R.’s practices, including the organization’s oversight of databases for home listings, called multiple listing sites or the M.L.S. The sites are owned and operated by N.A.R.’s local affiliates. For decades, the Justice Department has questioned whether these databases stifle competition and whether some N.A.R. rules foster price-fixing on commissions.

Some more key takeaways: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/15/realestate/nar-realtors-settlement-takeaways.html

1. Decoupling of seller and buyer commissions = home prices may drop as sellers commissions no longer directly included in price
2. Common rate likely to drop below 5-6% in total, although hard to guess where it'll land. Probably not as low as EU/UK.
3. Less conflicts of interests/steering buyers towards pricier homes
4. A million agents could end up leaving the profession

Point 4 kind of cracks me up. A million low skill workers are coming to take your jobs (if you sell MLM products or do a bunch of gig jobs). And no, they are not immigrants. They are former realtors lmao.

I guess part of me feels a bit bad. Then the other part of me who remembered they are just get-rich-quick vulture sorts who joined the biggest cartel in the nation to screw over homebuyers and sellers...and then I don't.

neoliberal,comment,Settlements,kv2d0pk,CptnAlex,,"So my thoughts:

1. Equilibrium price is when both a buyer and a seller meet in expectations. Input into cost of sale doesn’t really enter into a buyer’s calculus. Yes, a seller *could* lower their price and walk away the same, but why would they with so much pent up demand? They’ll just pocket the difference.

2. Maybe a little bit. Definitely now that consumers realize they can negotiate, they will. And short term we may see a change in commissions, but that’s because there are so many agents and so few properties. Again, this is a housing market issue in my opinion rather than a commission issue. Right now a buyer might be incentivized to pay *more* for a good agent with a lot of contacts than not; and some buyers may have to go without an agent, or go for a newer one that will deliver potentially worse service.

3. Unless the pay structure moves to fee based instead of commission, I don’t see why this changes

4. Yes, but this is because the musical chairs have stopped. The market can’t sustain the amount of agents that are out there- we probably had too many pre-covid, but then there was a bump due to covid.

Buying a home can be mystifying and stressful, so they often have to provide a lot of moral support to their clients during the process.

All that said, people still ought to think of the agent's commission as something that should be negotiated at the outset.  A needy client will suck up a lot of time.

neoliberal,comment,Annexation,krm5p9c,No_Bumblebee4179,,">At the congress of the so-called deputies of all levels of Transnistria, which will take place on **February 28, a request to Moscow regarding the accession of the separatist region to the Russian Federation would be adopted**. The statement was made by the Transnistrian opponent Ghenadie Ciorba, quoted by INFOTAG, according to Deschide.md.  
>  
>Ciorba warned over to the fact that **the gathering will take place a day before Russian President Vladimir Putin’s address to the Federal Assembly. The Transnistrian opposition does not rule out that this directive to organize the congress was given from Moscow itself.** Ciorba assumes that within the forum of the so-called deputies of all levels of Transnistria, **a request would be launched from the inhabitants of the left of the Dniester to join the region to the Russian Federation, and the next day, on February 29, Putin will announce this to the Assembly Federal, which will make the decision to proceed with the request.**  
>  
>The opponent believes that the assembly in Tiraspol and the protest organized there recently against the so-called economic pressures of the Republic of Moldova are aimed at showing that the residents of Transnistria are against Chisinau.  
>  
>*“This is where the recent statement by the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, comes from, as if Moscow will not let its citizens in Transnistria suffer,*” Ciorba also declared.  
>  
>He urged the so-called deputies of the region not to allow this decision to be taken, which will give Putin “a legal pretext to strike the territory of the Republic of Moldova, including Transnistria, under any pretext.”  
>  
>*“Madam President Sandu, your entourage constantly scared you with the fact that Russia will attack the territory of the Republic of Moldova.* *But you did not take into account the fact that* ***the psychology of the current leadership of Russia, especially Putin, is very similar to that of Hitler in the late 1930s.*** ***Attempts to reconcile individuals like Putin lead to only one thing, increasing the aggressor’s appetite”***, concluded Ciorba.

>On Monday, the leader of the separatists from Tiraspol, Vladimir Krasnoselski, announced the summoning of the so-called deputies of all levels in connection with the alleged economic pressures from Chisinau.

The issue with this is that untill Maia Sandu became president, the country has always been under leadership, that has been sort of the equivalent to how Viktor Yanukovych was to Ukraine. The product of this is that Moldova barely has any military force at all, and the only time, where they have been able to do something about it, has been in the previous two years.

Frankly, the politics Maia Sandu and her prime minister has been able to pull off in Moldova in the previous two years has been unprecedented, largely because Russia's ability to wage hybrid warfare against them is massively impeded by the war in Ukraine.

This meme is very frustrating to me. The UN was in many ways *designed* with the assumption that it would fail a lot of the time.

Better to just acknowledge that brute fact by giving them veto power at the outset.

Actual enforcement would require that all security council members agree that military intervention into a nation's affairs (aka WAR) is a good idea, something most of them are very unwilling to do.

I don't know that much about Bibi but I'm skeptical. From what I hear Bibi's father was even more conservative (way before Yoni's death). One of Bibi's main attribute is being risk averse, almost as reluctant to fight larger wars like this one (some have claimed this risk aversion might be partially to Yoni's death), as he is to try and make peace. My impression is that while he may have the instincts of right wing Zionism he's not an ideologue and it's more his corruption and selfish grasping to remain in power(and out of jail) which with the rise of Hamas has caused a lot of the problems.

neoliberal,comment,UN Resolution,kwjbyiz,3DWgUIIfIs,,"The radicalized pro-Israel side is rational. What is their incentive structure? US criticism is more closely tied to Biden's electoral needs than their actions. International media has burned their credibility by taking Hamas at their word particularly with the hospital bombing that turned out to be a misfired rocket hitting a parking lot, and with the amount of journalists saying that people should wait and see more evidence before saying there were any rapes, despite videos of naked corpses of women being spit on and videos of women's pants soaked in blood. Israel is routinely condemned by the UN more than the rest of the world combined. And currently, are being pushed to a unilateral ceasefire and the previous two ceasefires were broken by Hamas.

The job permit program for Palestinians was used to scout out places to attack. They left Gaza and terrorists won a plurality in an election, then forcibly took power indefinitely. Those same terrorists control all aid going into the area making its leaders very wealthy. That same aid is used to build tunnel networks. The alternative, Fatah, is disliked, and is led by an old man whose PhD is titled ""The Relationship Between Zionists and Nazis, 1933-1945"" and wrote a book in the 80s about how Zionists conspired with the Nazis to kill European Jews. 

Israel has less support for a two-state solution today, in small part because hundreds of the biggest supporters of the two-state solution died on October 7th. Rather than stop rocket attacks the way every other country on the planet has, they built a high-tech air defense system. A loss of US aid would result in cheaper, cruder bombings. The peaceful, economic, political approach has failed. Netanyahu's whole thing was to isolate and prevent any major conflict with Palestine while pursuing normalization with the rest of the Arab world. Mowing the grass didn't work. UN organizations operating in Gaza have close ties to Hamas. 

What would a cold rational actor do when they realize their actions and subsequent condemnations *aren't* closely tied, when they are dealing with a large double standard, when a terrorist organization is given more credibility than them, when their attempt at a peaceful solution hasn't worked, when they have zero international support for a long term solution that doesn't shoulder the entire burden on Israel, and are dealing with a population that has hated them more and more as the decades have gone by?",2024-03-25T20:01:56+00:00

And since Binationalism opens the border between Israel and Palestine, it makes a Two-State solution nearly impossible to revert to. 

Jewish Settlers would move to the West Bank en masse, and Palestinians would move into Israel proper - both motivated by their vision that the whole land belongs to their people. And without a border separating them, armed Jewish and Muslim groups would almost certainly be battling each other across the region. Which will push people to the extremes even further.

The article feels like it’s trying to convince **Americans** that a two state solution is the way to go. I’m not sure that’s a particularly useful purpose to have. 

It also steers clear of the big details of what an agreement would be. 

* **No real discussion of Jerusalem**, a super meaningful city to both Israel and Palestinians, and  a city both claim as their capital 

* **No discussion of what a Palestinian state’s sovereignty would look like**. Formalizing land exchanges is much easier than imagining a sovereign Palestinian state. Israel won’t let water pipes or concrete imported into Gaza. Will they be ok with a Palestinian state having an air force? 

* **Unrealistic description of political realities**. Hardliners on both sides hate the two state solution. A two state solution would be the end of the Israeli PMs career, and because he’s essentially in limbo on a corruption case as PM, would likely result in him going to prison. Neither Israeli nor Palestinian leadership is stable. If we get close to a solution, you’ll see outrage and terrorism from both sides. Will Palestinians sign off on a deal after settlers burn more thousand year old olive trees, or fill in Palestinian water wells? How will Palestinian leaders explain that they’re signing a deal after Israeli soldiers beat and hospitalize Palestinian worshippers in Jerusalem? How will Israelis feel if Palestinian terrorists have another student detonate a bomb on a bus? How will Israelis handle leaks of rape and torture from the 10/7 attack?

* **Doesn’t take actual Israeli priorities seriously**. This goes back to the sovereignty point a little bit, but Palestinians want freedom. Israelis want peace and security (and resolution to the Palestinian question to assuage neighbors).  I think neither side particularly cares about crisper maps with the current de facto borders. Yglesias talked about successes Israel’s had diplomatically with Jordan and Egypt, but he was careful to avoid Lebanon and Hezbollah. Israel considers Lebanon a far worse threat than Gaza. Before the 10/7 attacks, the Gaza border was pretty empty. Israelis were  stationed closer to Lebanon, the greater threat. A major reason the attack was so terrible was that troops weren’t nearby. A Palestinian state with freedom could very possibly turn into a more dangerous threat- like Hezbollahs presence in Lebanon. A Palestinian state without freedom is no real accomplishment, and it doesn’t resolve the Palestinian question.",2023-12-11T22:05:22+00:00

Oct 7th is what happened to the Israeli civilian population from a blockaded Hamas.  Imagine what a fully armed/equipped force could do in a space this close.

2. There is no resolution to the 'right to return', which I don't think the Palestinians are willing to give up. 

3.  There is no resolution to Al-Aqsa Mosque/Temple Mount.  If this is to be in a Palestinian states, would there be a guarantee that a Jew would be allowed to visit their most holy site?  This would be crucial to getting religious Jews on board, but I don't think Palestinians would accept anything less than complete control and the ability to discriminate here based on religion.

The upshot is that as a nation, the Palestinians seem to prefer the current state of affairs rather than giving up on these three points.  That makes the status-quo more of a solution than the 2 state solution.",2023-12-11T20:21:10+00:00

In the short run both major parties are dominated by zionist lobbyists etc, and will do pretty much whatever Netanyahu tells them to. (Except that every president since GWB has refused to invade Iran when Netanyahu told them to.)

But what *should* we do?

I say. the USA should issue every Jewish Israel a US passport and let them come live here if they want to. No Israeli should be forced to stay in harm's way.

And all support for the Israeli nation should be stopped.

I say that when a nation thinks their choices are genocide or continual culling, never quite enough to call it genocide but never a better choice than killing a fraction of the ""enemy"" population every few years, the USA should try to avoid alliance with that nation.

Like a friend told me when I was starting to get involved with a problematic woman, ""Never take on a girlfriend who owns a dragon ranch.""

Israel has nothing much to offer the USA. They are on bad terms with most of their neighbors, though some are trying to tolerate them for our sake and because they are so dangerous.

They do not help us with our wars. They help us more by staying strictly apart from them.

There are some US supply dumps in Israel, and Israelis object that the US flag flies over them. They contain supplies that the Israelis can use if they need to, that we don't need to have there.

Their intelligence service does provide the USA with vital information. They were the ones who told us about 9/11 in time to stop it. They were the ones who told us that Iraq had no nuclear weapons program. When we invaded Iraq they gave us vital information about how to occupy an arab nation without much resistance and set up a peaceful democratic government. They were so competent that they predicted the October attack and prevented it.

They have been a big help to the USA in our nuclear nonproliferation program. If they had nuclear weapons, many other nations would be strongly tempted to get them too, particularly all their enemies. But they promised us that they would never be the first to introduce nuclear weapons to the middle east, and by keeping that promise they have helped us a lot.

Their effect on the UN has been entirely beneficial to us. Nobody could help us more there.

But apart from that they are a liability. It's true that the direct monetary aid we give them amounts to only about $500 per Jewish Israeli per year. Far less than we give our own welfare recipients. Only a quarter trillion dollars total so far. But when we give them our most advanced secret weapons and the plans that let them copy those weapons themselves, that amounts to a whole lot.

Maybe without our aid they would suffer significant casualities themselves, maybe even more than they dish out. So make sure that no Jewish Israeli has to live there. We don't owe it to them to make sure they can keep slaughtering people there, decade after decade.",2023-10-30T15:22:34+00:00

GreenParty,comment,Palestine,ditz8se,WikiTextBot,,"##Zionism
Zionism (Hebrew: צִיּוֹנוּת‎ Tsiyyonut IPA: [t͡sijo̞ˈnut] after Zion) is the national movement of the Jewish people that supports the re-establishment of a Jewish homeland in the territory defined as the historic Land of Israel (roughly corresponding to Canaan, the Holy Land, or the Roman-named region Palestine). Modern Zionism emerged in the late 19th century in Central and Eastern Europe as a national revival movement, in reaction to anti-Semitic and exclusionary nationalist movements in Europe. Soon after this, most leaders of the movement associated the main goal with creating the desired state in Palestine, then an area controlled by the Ottoman Empire.

Until 1948, the primary goals of Zionism were the re-establishment of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel, ingathering of the exiles, and liberation of Jews from the antisemitic discrimination and persecution that they experienced during their diaspora. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Zionism continues primarily to advocate on behalf of Israel and to address threats to its continued existence and security.

Our main concern is US military and diplomatic participation in the war and in the criminal siege and bombardment that have already killed thousands in Gaza, wounded tens of thousands, and left a million homeless.

GPAX calls for ending the supply of weapons and financing to Israel; withdrawing US military assets from the region; and ending US war threats. The U.S. must also become constructively engaged in diplomatic efforts to resolve this persistent threat to world peace.

We support the widespread calls by UN officials and member countries, trade unionists, and others for a ceasefire, provision of humanitarian aid, the release of detained people, and long-term solutions based on justice and equality. We urge the Green Party and state parties to work with others for all these goals.

We believe that the recent meeting of President Joe Biden with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, combined with US unconditional support for the Israelis, will inflame the region even further. Without taking the steps we propose, the death and destruction will continue. Our goal is peace, but a peace accompanied by justice for all people of this region.""


Very well said. 

Israel needs to be a viable and safe state. (Whether we should've allowed this 100 years ago is another question,  but it is here). We should help then achieve that. I have no problem guaranteeing their general safety.

There should have been global condemnation of the  slow and deliberate encroachment onto disputed land. If israel is incapable of reaching a hand out and fixing this situation, then the rest of the world should have demanded it through sanctions. Instead, there was endless appeasement. When various groups created the BDS movement, a boycott harshly criticizing isaeli policy, they were essentially shouted down. Now, the world understands why the situation is absurd. And horrors are now following on both sides.

We must rethink US foreign policy across the board.

Many Israelis have nowhere to go. Some of them came to Israel from arab countries where Zionist actions and arab responses made them feel particularly unwelcome. 

Some of them came from Russia. When the USSR let Jews leave, Israel insisted that the USA not accept too many of them, wanting many to have no choice but to come to Israel.

No Jewish Israelis should be stuck living in Israel if they don't want to. The more of them that come to live in safety in the USA, the better off they will be. Israel does not have nearly enough water for 7 million Jewish Israelis, much less an extra 10% for Israel arabs and palestinians. 

If the time eventually comes that 80% of Jewish Israelis are not in Israel, the ones who remain might be more open to negotiation.",2023-11-04T23:37:53+00:00

GreenParty,post,West Bank,63ulzp,BorisMalden,Do you have to be a liberal to support green policies?,"I am passionate about many green policies and place sustainability at the heart of my political beliefs. We (in the west) appear to live in a society completely dominated by laissez-faire capitalism; banks and big business dominate politics and media and have rigged the system in their favour. The profit motive (which does not seem to trickle past the c-suite at all) is not only very bad for the vast majority of citizens, but is also destroying our environment. I believe radical change is needed if humanity is going to thrive.

However, when I look at the green parties around the world I see lots of liberal policies that I completely oppose. Take for example the contentious issue of immigration. Most liberals in my country support a laissez-faire, almost borderless immigration, without seeming to be too concerned about the environmental impact. We have hundreds of thousands of people entering the country each year, and no one on the left seems to be too worried about the fact that this is completely unsustainable - more and more green space is disappearing each year. I would support heavy control on immigration so that net migration is not much different to 0 - I know that's typically regarded as a right-wing view.

That's just one reason why I can't identify with liberals, though there are plenty more. I don't think that makes me any less of a Green though. So what do you think? Is there room in the Green Party for people who have anti-liberal views?",2017-04-06T17:57:36+00:00

I think we all share some core beliefs.  Environmental rights, human rights, voter rights, restrictions on corporate over-reach, government transparency, non-militarism, privacy rights...

These are important issues, but we have to find a way to pull in earnest moderate conservatives and libertarians without compromising our core beliefs or we'll sit and watch our issues get farther and farther from reality.

But the one group we need to cut loose of is the corporate 3rd way Clinton liberals.  They're whole purpose is to co-opt the progressives and disarm us, in service of their corporate pay masters.

**The March for Fossil Fuel Freedom: A 34-mile walk to Expose Oily Wells**

Wells Fargo Bank has a dirty-energy secret: it's a leading lender to the fossil-fuel industry. That's why a coalition of supporters - including Santa Clara County Green Party - is participating in a campaign targeting San Francisco-based ""Oily Wells"" and marching 34 miles, from Palo Alto to San Francisco.

Join the Santa Clara Greens as we host the first stagecoach stop!

Join us at our stagecoach stop on Saturday, March 16 and enjoy refreshments & snacks, and talk about how our economic, environmental, social welfare, and foreign policies are all tangled in the web of corporate greed. The Green Party message is #NoMoreWars and #NoBloodForOil.

There will be 12 ""stagecoach stops"" along the way – one for every year that remains to [**take urgent action on climate change**](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) – and marchers will arrive at the bank's world headquarters just in time to crash their annual founding day celebration.

GreenParty,post,West Bank,5b5c4r,SymbioticPatriotic,Be a Stein-Baraka / Green Party Activist at the State Level,"We are going into the final weekend, and the r/jillstein boards are becoming swamped with activity and postings. 

To help out those who want to be active over the final weekend in their own state, there are now sub-Reddits for Jill Stein that have been established at the state level for every state containing the most popular posts (articles, polls, texts) from r/jillstein have been cross-linked to those pages. 

Every state board contains a sticky post at the top that gives you a list of ways you can be an activist for Stein-Baraka in your state.

Here`is how you can get become an activist at the state level:

1. Subscribe to the Jill Stein board for your state. Read the link on How to Help the Stein/Baraka Ticket in Your State for local ideas.

2. Look at the content that is posted there, and upvote as you feel appropriate. If you feel there is additional things to say - articles, pictures, Youtubes, memes - feel free to post it there. You are also welcome to place links about local or state Green Party candidates and their campaign news and activities. Be sure to check out the Other Discussions in the comment field, and if you liked the story, upvote it on all the other sites it appears across Reddit.

3. Use the content links to share stories about Jill and Ajamu with your neighbors on the state, county and city Reddits. The Stein-Baraka campaign have lacked coverage by the MSM, so you can help spread the message by posting a state-based article in your hometown. And contribute a comment to your article on why you feel Jill and Ajamu are the only choice this Tuesday.

4. Use the board as a place to link up with activists in your state for activities (phone-banking, getting out the vote, flyering, tabling, canvassing, demostrating against DAPL, whatever). 

Soon, I will be publishing an updated state-by-state poll of where the Stein-Baraka campaign stands nationally, and we are doing better than the RealPolitics averages would have you believe. We have been gaining over the past week day-by-day, and going into this final weekend, the 5% threshold is within our grasp if we work hard over the next five days.

GreenParty,post,West Bank,y0uf3,timesofgrace,"You guys do realize that local candidates rely on the strength of national candidates, right? A successful party can't do one or the other, it has to do both simultaneously.","There were a couple posts that had sentiments I totally disagreed with. Mainly about the ineptitude of the party and the irrelevance of a presidential campaign that can't be won. There was so much truthiness going on in the comments section in a couple threads, I could not express my thoughts one by one, so I wanted to give my thoughts here:

*""Jill Stein won't win."" *

Thank you, that is very insightful!

Now, if this is important to you (to some of us, it is not) what are you going to do about it? Besides complain? 

This is a democracy; in democracies you have to get up, fight, and make your voice heard. If no one listens, you may have to yell louder, or get arrested at a bank protest. In some cases, people will only listen to you because someone on your presidential ticket appeals to them.

Many never would have heard of the Green Party if it weren't for Jill Stein. 

The reason a lot of local Green elected officials (yes, they exist contrary to the assumptions of most. Here's Maddow interviewing one: http://www.darylnorthrop.com/blog/2011/6/26/mayor-jason-west-g-on-rachel-maddow.html) get any exposure at all is because they are linked to the Presidential candidates.

In other words, you can't get exposure to local candidates unless they piggyback off a strong national candidate. It's like a sacrifice fly in baseball; it looks bad on the stats sheet, but it's what's best for the whole team. If you look at the 2008 election and how excitement for Obama carried over to lesser known local candidates, you can see how this dynamic works.


Also, turnout for presidential elections is much higher than midterms. 

That's because voters want to support their presidential candidate, and if there is none, many people will stay home. That will absolutely KILL turnout for the local candidates. Again, presidential candidtates are critical for turnout.

So to say ""Stein is wasting her time, focus on local elections"" is a profoundly misinformed strategy. 

The only reason we are having this discussion about local candidates is because Dr. Stein is such a strong national candidate who has brought attention to potential victories local races. McKinney and Cobb were never as strong as her.

And yes, the Greens are already running for school board, city council, county council, and mayor (http://www.greenpartywatch.org/2012/03/15/56-green-candidates-campaigning-for-office-in-texas/). The question is, are you supporting your Green school board, city council, county council, or mayoral candidates? Do you even know who they are? Do you have Google? How are you helping them?


How can a local candidate get federally matched funds? Do you realize that Stein's matching funds are being used for local ballot access goals? The local candidates wouldn't even be on the ballot in states like PA if it weren't for resources from the national presidential campaign being funnelled for local use.


This is not an easy thing to do. How many states does the supposedly more ""experienced"" Rocky Anderson have ballot access in? With all her fame and connections, how could Barr not raise enough money for federal matching funds? How could an unknown doctor beat a multimillionaire Hollywood actress? This is a lot more complicated than you guys think... Obama has more campaign offices in Stein's neighborhood than she has employees on her entire staff; the reason for this is corporate money, not ineptitude.



I hate to break it to you guys, but if you are voting because you want to win, rather than doing what is right, you are in the wrong place. 

A vote for Greens is a vote for resistance. 

It is a vote for ""none of the above."" 

It is a vote for obstructing the status quo of the corporate state. 

It is a vote for raising awareness that there is another way.

Getting elected to the CEO position of the United Corporations of America is not the goal here. 

Your vote is a protest vote. 

I have never heard of an anti-war protester or an Occupier who said ""We've been out here all day, and the the war isn't over yet & we haven't won anything. Let's go home and vote for Obama because he will win."" 

This is the mentality of paralysis. This mentality would have killed just about every successful socio-political movement from day one.


Not voting, or a vote for a corporate Democrat, is a signal that you are ok with the status quo; that what is going on is not a big enough deal for you to spend the time to vote. 

If you think that making your voice heard is a waste of time, I don't know what to tell you. I guess you should stay home & watch reality TV. Or better yet, watch live coverage of the election where the rest of the country decides your fate without you.


**TL;DR**

*Presidential campaigns get local candidates on the ballot, raise money for them, funnel national resources to them, and get local candidates media attention. Voters mainly turn out for presidential votint, which coattail off to local candidates, not the other way around. Do you even know who your local candidates are?*

*Voting Green for president has other goals besides being in charge of a corrupt government. It is mainly about resistance and protest, but also it helps in getting local candidates elected. Voting for a Democrat or not voting at all has the same result, which is getting more of what you already hate.*

GreenParty,comment,West Bank,c5rbifh,vwboyaf1,,"Seeing how I am the guy raising a lot of the fuss, I think I owe you a response.  

I understand that the Green Party has a proud history of integrity, protest, and standing up for what is right no matter what.  I appreciate that, and judging from the 10 Key Values, the Green Party seems like the party I want representing me.  

Here is the problem.  The Green Party, from what I gather in your comments, is not interested in actually representing anybody as a governing power.  You talk about being a resistance, a vote for ""none of the above"", and that getting elected to ""CEO position of the United Corporations of America in not the goal here"".  How insulting to the the American voter.  

We have been doing this for 12 years with very minimal success, and now I believe it is time to start taking this a little more seriously.  It is time to come up with a real strategy to win elections and start representing people.  People have put in a lot of money, volunteer time, and their reputations on the line to help this party.  What is there to show for it.  I see no Green Party rep sitting higher than selectperson anywhere in government.  

You say that having a national candidate helps the local elections through fundraising and awareness.  I think the the strategy is completely backwards.  The Green Party is proud of her grassroots campaigning, but yet, shoots for the ultimate goal before even winning a single seat in any congress, state or national.  How is Jill Stein even supposed to get anything done once she is President if she doesn't  have a single friend in Congress, besides Bernie Sanders?

People seem confused about the term ""geographical base"" this does not mean having a headquarters set up in a state; it means consistently winning in that state or region.  It means focusing effort on finding elections that are ripe for the taking and going after them with a bit of aggressiveness.  This is politics, the goal is to get elected and become productive from within the government, not shout at it from the doorway.   

So, in the end, the American voters are only going to vote for a party that is really in it to win, to gain power, and to represent them in government.  If we are only in it to shift the conversation, or be a thorn in the side of the Dems, most voters will never take us seriously.

GreenParty,comment,West Bank,c5rcoch,timesofgrace,,"> The Green Party, from what I gather in your comments, is not interested in actually representing anybody as a governing power. 

No, that is not true at all. I never said that. I said the opposite, that the goal is to get local candidates elected. I even gave you a video link to an elected Green mayor who was interviewed by Rachel Maddow. Google Gayle McLaughlin. Ever heard of [Pam Hartwell-Herrero](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIUou6SH4xs&playnext=1&list=PL04693CB86E54BA73&feature=results_video&noredirect=1)? Saying that there are candidates who aren't serious about getting elected locally is false. I really don't know where this perception is coming from. 

Bernie Sanders started out as a mayor, and it took *decades* before he made it to the senate.

Building a party infrastructure takes DECADES, not a few election cycles. 10 years is nothing. That is only 2 election cycles. The Republican party is 15 times that old, and they are the *youngest* of the two legacy parties.

The point is that many people have no idea what it takes to get a political party established. People have no idea how alternative parties function, how they apply pressure to the 2 party system, and how they can achieve goals without winning the White House. The Libertarian platform has subsumed the GOP, and they have won nothing. If anything, the Greens have been more successful than them, but Libs are the ones who got their anti-govt policies enacted, which started with David Koch being their VP nominee in the 70s; again, it took decades of work to get his policies enacted.

I say this as someone who used to think *exactly* like you. You are no different than I was. I was guilty of all these thoughts: 

""They aren't serious""

""They don't know what they are doing""

""This is taking too long""

""I can do better than this""

etc.

You should go to a local GP meeting and tell them your bright ideas. See what they tell you. Chances are, you'll hear the same things I heard when I tried to impress them with my ""brilliance:""

""No shit, Sherlock.""

""Golly gee, run for local office? Wow, we never thought of THAT before!""

""Buy campaign ads! What a great idea?! We NEVER thought of that! So do you have $15 million dollars to buy air time?""

""Outreach to unions and environmental groups doesn't work, they won't return our calls.""

""Outreach to college students isn't as fruitful as you think because they don't turn out to vote, and many students are from out of state anyway""

""We don't have much cash on hand because we need the money for suing the government just to stay on the ballot""

""We don't have time to do X, Y, & Z because we have to collect 20,000 signatures just to stay on the ballot""

etc.

There is a lot going on behind the scenes that you have no idea about. If you knew about some of this stuff, you'd be forced to admit that it's a small miracle that this party still exists in this country.

But again, the strategy *is* to elect local candidates. That is the entire point, and from there you can move up into congress, like Sanders. That's why the GP is made up of small local organizations, and is not ruled by a big national party. 

But to say the local candidates can't benefit from a popular nationwide candidate is false. Again, look what the congressional Dems did in 2008 with Obama, and look what happened to Dems in 2010 when Obama was widely seen as a disappointment.

I was listening to Jill Stein's presidential bid announcement the day it aired on Democracy Now a couple of weeks ago, and although she sounds great there isn't much at all to distinguish her from Bernie. When Amy Goodman asked how she was different, she said that unlike Bernie she isn't backed by a 'big-money' party. I am a huge Bernie supporter with a professional background in politics and I can tell you the DNC/Democratic party establishment does *not* back him. Hillary is their preferred choice, but I'm a true populist progressive and I love Bernie and all my friends are Bernie supporters. His short-lived campaign has gotten liberals who don't care about politics energized and amped to participate for a change, and he doesn't accept SuperPac money. 

I'm just curious and wondering why support Jill Stein if Bernie is the best chance at getting a progressive to the White House? I think it'd make more sense to support him in state primaries against Hillary if we all want the same thing.

>If you want to support a Democrat, get out of the Green Party to do so. When Sanders loses next April you can rejoin the Greens.
The Democratic Party is well-designed to ensure that people like Sanders (or Dennis Kucinich or Jesse Jackson) can never win. When 20% of the delegates are superdelegates who do not have to vote based on how people vote in primaries, as it is in the Democratic primary process. The superdelegates serve as an effective block of the people's will. And, the primaries are designed to prevent upstarts from challenging Wall Street Democrats, e.g. there are 24 primaries or caucuses in March. Unless you have hundreds of millions of advertising dollars you can't compete in half the states in one month.
So, go advocate for Sanders. He stands for lots of good issues (but on some key issues he is terrible, e.g. militarism and Israel) and when it is over you can re-join the Green Party. But, it is inappropriate to advocate for another party from within the Green Party.

Stromgem has every right to advocate for Sanders but he crossed the line taking his advocacy into Green Party spaces.  We can all understand why people are excited about Sanders, but we also need Greens preparing the way for Green campaigns between now and May-June when Sanders likely loses the primary to a corporate Dem.  If everybody is out there campaigning for Sanders then nobody will be doing the groundwork for the Stein campaign that will be our best option once Sanders loses.  Note that it looks like the Green Party will be the only significant leftist 3rd party contesting the 2016 election.

GreenParty,comment,Conflict,ctaqsax,Illin_Spree,,">Not trying to hate on Stein - I do like her. I just have Green Party friends and was wondering what your party members' thoughts were? 

Most of us have supported an insurgent or leftist Dem before.  We've learned via experience that the Democratic Party is not democratic--the monied corporate candidate ultimately wins.  And if somehow the progressive base gets control of part of the party apparatus and the insurgent candidate wins (see the movement that nominated McGovern in 72) then the establishment makes sure he's destroyed, compelling the Democratic base to go with another moderate in the next election, who ultimately helps hand the party apparatus back to corporate interests.

Since 1976 (about the time when neoliberalism got going), the Democratic Party has become (once again) a corporate party in the hands of monied interests.  This phenomenon intensified during the Clinton years and has culminated with the Obama presidency where many key staff members are employees from Goldman Sachs.

What we need is a party with a genuinely grassroots democratic institutional structure that will guarantee that our candidates represent the people, and this is what the Greens are trying to build.  

The Bernie phenomenon is the most refreshing moment in Democratic Party politics in my lifetime.  But it's noteworthy that the candidate isn't even a Democrat, and is seen as a longshot even though he (like Ron Paul did in 08 and 12) is drawing huge crowds and has way more grassroots support than any corporate candidate.  Yes, he has a better chance of winning the presidency than Stein, but it's still a miniscule chance, and not enough of one to compel us to stop trying to build up an independent 3rd party that represents the interests of the vast majority of citizens.",2015-07-21T10:43:58+00:00

>Today, when a Green Foreign Minister does not have the courage to summon an ambassador who insults the Federal President and the Chancellor, and who admires a politician whose organization took part in pogroms against the Jewish population in Ukraine during the Second World War alongside the Wehrmacht involved.  
>  
>Today, when the primary goal of green foreign policy is no longer to end wars and avoid suffering, but where it only has one direction: to supply more and more powerful weapons in order to then possibly be able to negotiate “with the gun on the table”. . Where green foreign policy wants to achieve peace through victory in war, when Annalena Baerbock states that the goal is that Ukraine must “win” the war. Green foreign policy is driven by this goal - and is therefore no different from the foreign policy of the once ardent George Bush admirer Friedrich Merz and the arms lobbyist Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann. Anyone who only sets the goal of winning has already surrendered to the logic of war, is mentally at war and no longer has the power to act against the war itself and to politically pursue ending it as the highest goal. The American historian Barbara Tuchman used the example of the First World War to show that nobody actually wanted this war, but Europe fell to pieces because everyone got involved in war as a political means.  
>  
>I became a member on October 5, 1978 at the founding meeting of the Alternative List for Democracy and Environmental Protection, which became the newly founded Green Party in 1980. So you can't be a member of the Green Party for longer than me. Over 45 years. They're coming to an end. As Antje Vollmer wrote in her last essay, the Greens have sacrificed their peace and environmental policy ideals “for the mere goal of playing in the great geopolitical power poker.” That's why I'm leaving.  
>  
>The final deciding factor was Anton Hofreiter's attack against Olaf Scholz's sensible policy of not wanting to deliver Taurus missiles, an attack in coalition with Merz and Strack-Zimmermann. Hofreiter describes Scholz’s refusal as “irresponsible”. Joe Biden, on the other hand, declares that he does not want to deliver long-range ATACMS in order to avoid a third world war. According to military officials such as ex-Brigadier General Erich Vad, former military policy advisor to Angela Merkel, the delivery of Taurus would escalate the war. Does Hofreiter take responsibility for this? And for the fact that the supply of every additional heavy weapon blurs the border beyond which NATO becomes a warring party, as ex-Brigadier General Helmut Ganser says?  
>  
>What exactly is the aim of supplying first Leopard tanks and now Taurus cruise missiles? They cannot change the fact that Russia has greater potential to escalate the war than Ukraine. Should more weapons be delivered if Russia continues to escalate? “Do the proponents \[of arms deliveries\] not see the risk of escalation to the point of nuclear war?” asked Christian Ströbele in April 2022. They seem to be playing with it today in order to feel morally on the right side.  
>  
>Some time ago I read an interview with a Ukrainian politician in which he said that he was not afraid of a nuclear war because the technologically superior USA would be faster than Russia in a nuclear exchange. How blind do you have to be to speculate on the devastation of the northern hemisphere for the sake of justice? Annalena Baerbock and Anton Hofreiter also seem to be blinded by the supposed superiority of Western weapons and do not shy away from military confrontation with the world's strongest nuclear power. Erich Vad has realistically pointed out that Russia would rather resort to nuclear weapons than strategically withdraw from the Black Sea region. John F. Kennedy once said in 1962 that nuclear powers must avoid confrontations “that leave an adversary with only the choice of humiliating withdrawal or nuclear war.”  
>  
>Mark Milley, US chief of staff until September 2023, said there can be no military solution. Former NATO general Harald Kujat describes it as fanaticism when politicians say that Ukraine will win because it has to win. Russia has already moved tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus and has ten times more tactical nuclear weapons than NATO has in Europe. Their use poses a real risk. Brigadier General (ret.) Helmut Ganser, former German representative at NATO, criticizes the fact that this is being carelessly overlooked. And he writes that the justified indignation over Russia's war against Ukraine should not block the ""taking of paths that prevent far worse things.""  
>  
>There is no sign of this in Green foreign policy. Not a single initiative by the Foreign Minister to at least reach a ceasefire. Instead, she declares to the Council of Europe: “We are fighting a war against Russia,” showing how she thinks. Green foreign policy today has the main goal of humiliating Russia, even though the Russian leadership has made it clear on numerous occasions that it would rather resort to nuclear weapons than allow itself to be humiliated. Medvedev said in February last year that if the US wanted Russia to be defeated, it had the right to resort to nuclear weapons. Delivering Taurus to win means nothing other than pursuing a policy that aims to force Russia's defeat militarily.  
>  
>Anyone who thinks of solidarity primarily in terms of arms deliveries understands solidarity in military terms as a brotherhood in arms. Those who issue the slogan “Continue to victory” do not think about the numerous additional dead, maimed and traumatized people that this policy will cost. Why is protecting borders more valuable to Green foreign policymakers than protecting lives?  
>  
>At school I once learned the old Roman wisdom that you should think about the end in everything you do. Where should the politics of wanting to win lead? The unconditional surrender of Russia that Zelensky demands can only be achieved in an epic war, a Third World War, that could devastate Europe or even the Northern Hemisphere.  
>  
>And if Russia could be defeated without nuclear war, would it be a less dangerous Russia? Germany fought World War II because it was defeated, humiliated by reparations and enormously weakened economically. It stimulated the economy through a war economy, which from the late 1930s could only continue to exist as a predatory economy. Wouldn't a weakened Russia be a far more dangerous Russia?  
>  
>Baerbock can't think that far ahead. In February 2022, she announced that she wanted to “ruin” Russia through sanctions. None of this happened. As a result of the sanctions, Russia's ties with the world's largest countries, China and India, and with the African continent have been strengthened. The formation of a bloc between the BRICS states became solidified, including the first joint naval maneuvers by Russia, China and South Africa.  
>  
>Anyone who uses a word like “ruin” wants to humiliate without thinking that Germany waged war to destroy Bolshevik Russia. But lessons from history are no longer being learned in Green foreign and security policy anyway. She has become blind to history. And driven to preserve Western hegemony.  
>  
>On October 3, 2023, Annalena Baerbock only thanked the Western Allies for reunification, although the Russian leadership did much to deserve it, while England tried to prevent it. Either Baerbock doesn't know this or she is distorting the facts. Both disqualify her for her position. She disrespectfully stayed away from Gorbachev's funeral.  
>  
>With the Greens, those who do not want to acknowledge that the West, Europe and North America, have lost their role as hegemon have been given the say in foreign policy. Baerbock is trying to replace the lost military and economic dominance with moral dominance. Therefore, she travels the world as a teacher and announces everywhere what “should” or “must” happen. This is called values-driven foreign policy and means calling China's head of state a dictator during an official visit or shouting to Lavrov with a raised fist at the G-20 summit: ""Stop the war."" With such gestures she can feel like a righteous person and score points with those who in Germany confuse outrage with reason and want to feel comfortable with our foreign minister showing them to be one of the good guys and stand up to the bad guys. She does not stand up for Assange, and Elon Musk is not criticized when he has his Starlink satellite network around Crimea switched off in order to prevent the Russian Black Sea Fleet from being sunk with satellite-supported underwater drones. He's an American. When Ricarda Lang says in an interview with the Berliner Zeitung that Russia's attack is directed “against democracy as such,” analysis is replaced by pure chatter.  
>  
>Baerbock's value-driven foreign policy substitutes outrage for reason and thus succumbs to the populist pull of pacifying the feelings of a supporter longing for justice. Baerbock hasn't achieved anything so far. She presents herself as a good guy instead of using diplomatic means to try to do something, even if it's just a little bit better. This foreign policy does not have a politically effective strategy. Because acting strategically does not mean saying what you want, but rather working for what is possible for the well-being of people and your own interests. The clever Egon Bahr once said that international politics is about the interests of states. Baerbock's politics do not follow interests, but rather moral imperatives. The former head of the policy department at the Foreign Office, Hellmut Hoffmann, aptly characterized this attitude as follows: “Justice prevails, even if the world perishes.”  
>  
>Before Russia invaded Ukraine, being against corrupt regimes was considered part of the Green Party's human rights policy. According to Transparency International's corruption index, Ukraine was ranked 122nd at the start of the war. No country in Europe was considered more corrupt than Ukraine. The comedian Zelensky was elevated to office by the oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky through the power of television.  
>  
>Anyone who ran against the interests of the oligarchs in Ukraine had no chance. Today, Kolomoisky himself is in prison, while Zelensky is expanding his autocracy through martial law. This will all be forgotten.  
>  
>Lavrov said in Beijing last year that peace talks would be possible if a new world order emerged without US hegemony. We can't trust that. But as Barbara Tuchman has noted, you have to be able to see the enemy's perspective in order to avoid slipping into war. Green foreign policy, however, insists on defending Western hegemony. If the West is not prepared to recognize that the world has become multipolar and that it has lost its supremacy over the world, and instead continues to fight for this supremacy through moral, economic and military means, it must expect that the world order will collapse in a major way World War III will change, just as the dominance of Europe and Japan was broken by World War II. Anyone who believes that Russia will never use the nuclear weapons it has is naive. Putin constantly points out their readiness for action, and he has already shown in conventional war that he does not shy away from escalation. Russia's possible actions can only be understood based on the forces of history and the inherent logic of wars. Anyone who thinks that Russia would never use nuclear weapons essentially considers themselves to be the ones who actually “understand Putin” because they believe they can rationally calculate his possible actions.  
>  
>The Greens from the founding generation still knew that there would be no winner in Europe if a war broke out here. Today's Greens join in the chorus of wanting to fight to victory, led by Hofreiter and Baerbock, whom the clever Green Party Antje Vollmer described as the “shrillest trumpet of the new antagonistic NATO strategy”.

[The Green Party](https://www.gp.org/) observes the 39th anniversary of the United Nations International Day of Peace on September 21 by affirming support for the [UN General Assembly Resolution 36/37](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/gpus/pages/11173/attachments/original/1600690545/UN-Year-of-Peace-resolution.pdf?1600690545) to “commit to peace above all difference.” The 1981 Resolution established the International Day of Peace with unanimous support.

Green Party leaders condemn the perpetual state of war launched, with bitter irony, on the 19th anniversary of the Day of Peace Resolution with the passage of the post-9/11[ Authorization for Use of Military](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2829/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22S.J.Res.+2%22%5D%7D&r=50&s=1) Force (AUMF). Green Leaders also emphasized the party’s [demand for the repeal of the AUMF](https://www.gp.org/democracy#demForeignPolicy), which has even greater urgency with the global crises of COVID-19 and climate disruption.

[**Howie Hawkins**](https://howiehawkins.us/)**, Green Party Presidential Nominee:**

“It is shameful that in May the US was the sole UN Security Council veto of the proposed global ceasefire in order to cooperate to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is a far greater threat to Americans than any force the US is fighting in its endless wars. The US ruling class would rather make war than heal the sick. So the US leads the world in deaths from COVID-19 at home and deaths in its foreign wars abroad. Those are terrible facts to recognize on the UN’s International Day of Peace.""

[**Angela Walker**](https://howiehawkins.us/about-angela-walker/)**, Green Party Nominee for Vice-President:**

""If the United States is to change its status in the world from one of aggression and domination to one of peace and cooperation, we must repeal the Authorization for Use of Force Act.""

[**Madelyn Hoffman**](https://www.hoffmanforsenate.com/)**, Green Party Candidate for US Senate (NJ), and Co-Chair of the Green Party’s Peace Action Committee (GPAX):**

“The ramifications of war and preparation for war echo in every corner of human society in our country and abroad with devastating effects. It is time to end the horrible atrocities and unacceptable costs inflicted on humanity by the perpetuation of endless war.”

[**Lisa Savage**](https://www.lisaformaine.org/)**, Green Party Candidate US Senate (ME):**

“Our nation has become a military empire exporting violence and weaponry around the world while imposing austerity at home to pay for it. I call for an immediate end to US wars of aggression, occupations, and military bases in other people's countries. Let's bring the war dollars home and take care of our own urgent needs during this pandemic: Medicare for All universal single-payer improved and expanded health care, and a demilitarized Green New Deal to address the climate emergency that is our biggest security threat. As global citizens, let's not fight each other for resources but instead cooperate with one another to develop a response to the immediate threat of the COVID-19 virus.”

This year’s Peace Day theme is “Shaping Peace Together,” with the emphasis on working together globally to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this year,[ United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called for an immediate global ceasefire](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-03-23/secretary-generals-appeal-for-global-ceasefire), saying, “End the sickness of war and fight the disease that is ravaging our world. . . That is what our human family needs . . .” His call for “solidarity across borders” is consistent with the Green Party’s belief that peace, environmental responsibility and health are intimately connected. Anyone who now denies we are one interdependent human species across borders on mother earth is not in tune to the unprecedented moment we share today.

According to the GPAX[ World Peace Action platform](https://gpus.org/committees/peace-action/the-green-partys-world-peace-platform/): “Despite the United Nations call for a [global ceasefire](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1059972) during the Covid-19 world-wide pandemic, our government has instead deployed [20,000 troops to Europe](https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/04/trump-sending-20-000-troops-to-train-with-europeans-on-russian-border) to encircle Russia, and has sent warships to threaten [Venezuela](https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/04/07/trump-sends-gun-boats-to-venezuela-while-the-world-partners-to-fight-a-deadly-pandemic/), [Iran](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/04/22/trump-tweets-that-hes-instructed-the-navy-to-destroy-any-iranian-gunboats-that-harass-us-warships/), and [China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/world/asia/coronavirus-south-china-sea-warships.html). … Further, our country’s interventions in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East have left us mired in endless wars that have [weakened our country’s economic vitality](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/) and [decreased opportunities for our children](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/12/09/staggering-new-data-shows-income-top-1-has-grown-100-times-faster-bottom-50-1970).”

The Green Party’s Peace Action Committee has issued a[ Peace Pledge](https://gpax.gpus.org/peace-pledges/candidates-for-state-and-local-offices/) which they encourage all candidates for state and local office to sign. 

“We have the opportunity while being forced to adapt to a pandemic to reflect on the very real opportunities to end our unsustainable way of life,” said **Susan Lamont** of the Green Party of California. “Let’s use this opportunity to rethink the ways in which we interact as people and as nations.”  She added that the Green party of California [platform](http://www.cagreens.org/platform/peace-non-violence) “advocates a fundamental change in the way we socialize our citizens, structure our institutions, and relate to the planet and its people.” On this 2020 International Day of Peace, we remind people loudly and clearly that “peace is not just the absence of violence, it is a willingness to resolve conflict in a constructive manner with a spirit of good will and respect.” [http://www.cagreens.org/platform/peace-non-violence](http://www.cagreens.org/platform/peace-non-violence)

GreenParty,comment,Ceasefire,kus71nl,jethomas5,,"We have several opposing goals, and we can't expect to just go by one ideology to decide what to do for every occasion.

So for example we have an obligation to overthrow dictatorships anywhere in the world and replace them with democracies, as we did in Iraq. It's wrong for us to allow foreign dictators to dominate their people, since we are strong enough to beat their armies and hang their dictators.

And when a foreign nation has a popular consensus that they want to be an empire and dominate other nations,  we have an obligation to fight them and keep them from doing that, anywhere in the world. If we don't do it, one of them will get big enough and strong enough to dominate the world, and we can't allow that.

Putin is a dictator and his people want the Russian empire to dominate the world, and it turns out they are far stronger than we thought they were even a year ago. When it turns out that the only way to stop them is with a nuclear war that kills everybody in the world, don't we have an obligation to do that?

On the other hand, we are also dedicated to peace. What if the Russians will settle for not being too dominated by NATO? What if they are willing to settle for a slice of eastern Ukraine that doesn't include much fossil fuel? Perhaps we can wait and see what they're really willing to settle for, without deciding ahead of time that the only way to stop them is by killing enough of them to get an unconditional surrender.

I personally believe that we are limited by reality, whatever we want. The way we are running our economy now, cannot continue. We depend too much on fossil fuel. Fracking lets us suck out the last dregs quicker, which brings us closer to a sudden crisis. We depend too much on highly mechanized farming, which uses fossil fuel to create nitrogen fertilizer and on fossil fuel to quickly mine the last phosphates, and fossil fuel to create insecticides and herbicides, and fossil fuel to move frozen or refrigerated food long distances. Our banking system is a nightmare. Etc. We are heading for a restriction in resources, precisely when we need to use a lot of resources to organize reforms. 

We can't afford to keep dominating the whole world. We \*have\* to reduce our military expenses, and repurpose many of our engineers to peaceful technology. When we get past the tough times then we can think about whether to go back to dominating the world again. 

If we have to get into a world war while we're retooling, then we'll suffer. But if we get into a world war before we retool we'll suffer worse. So we must do the best we can.",2024-03-14T03:09:47+00:00

[**The Green Party of Colorado**](https://coloradogreenparty.org/) (GPCO) strongly condemns today’s attempted coup in Venezuela by the US government-backed, right-wing terrorist group led by Juan Guaidó. The Venezuelan government and military have exhibited great restraint in dealing with these elements, which have been responsible for [destroying medical clinics](https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/14406)and [setting pro-Chavista Afro-Venezuelans on fire in the streets](https://www.thenation.com/article/burning-man-venezuela/).

We condemn the US government’s call for a violent military coup in Venezuela. We denounce the violent rhetoric of President Donald Trump, National Security Advisor John Bolton, and [convicted war criminal Elliot Abrams](http://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/02/the-tragic-life-of-the-war-criminal-elliott-abrams), who is now in charge of steering US government policy on Venezuela. We note with great disappointment that Colorado’s newly-elected governor,  [Jared Polis supports the violent, US-backed regime change against the poor and working class Venezuelan people](https://yellowscene.com/2019/01/24/governor-polis-supports-what-appears-to-be-a-coup-in-venezuala-following-trumps-lead-editorial/). As Colorado Greens, racist regime change of sovereign foreign governments is a duopolist endeavor which we will not support.

As recognized activists for election integrity, GPCO points out that [Venezuela’s election process is more democratic](https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/14305), transparent and fair than that of the United States. This fact has been verified in election after election, by myriad outside foreign monitors. Venezuelans are right to protect their democratic process with vigor.

We also must praise our Green Party comrades who are part of the [Embassy Protection Collective](https://www.facebook.com/ColectivosporlaPaz/) defending the Venezuelan embassy in Washington DC at the request of President Maduro. Green Party national co-chair, [Dr. Margaret Flowers](https://www.gp.org/dr_margaret_flowers) and fellow Green, [Kevin Zeese](https://www.gp.org/kevin_zeese) are standing in solidarity with Code Pink and others in an attempt to hold sovereign territory for the democratically-elected Venezuelan government against imperialist intervention of President Donald Trump, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and all other supporters of murderous regime change in the global south and around the world.

We call upon all Greens and our allies to support the actions of the Embassy Protection Collective and to reinvigorate the anti-war, anti-imperialist movement that has been asleep during the Obama administration. Now is the hour for those who love peace and freedom to step forward.

**To: US State Department**  
**Venezuelan Foreign Ministry**  
**From: Embassy Protection Collective**  
**Re: Exiting the Venezuelan Embassy**  
**Date: May 13, 2019**

This is the 34th day of our living in the Venezuelan embassy in Washington, DC. We are prepared to stay another 34 days, or however long is needed to resolve the embassy dispute in a peaceful way consistent with international law.

This memo is being sent to the US and Venezuela as well as members of our Collective and allies. We are encouraging people to publish this memo as a transparent process is needed to prevent the US from making a unilateral decision that could impact the security of embassies around the world and lead to military conflict.

There are two ways to resolve the issues around the Venezuelan embassy in DC, which we will explain.

Before doing so, we reiterate that our collective is one of independent people and organizations not affiliated with any government. While we are all US citizens, we are not agents of the United States. While we are here with permission of the Venezuelan government, we are not their agents or representatives.

We are here in the embassy lawfully. We are breaking no laws. We did not unlawfully enter and we are not trespassing.

1. Exiting with a Protecting Power Agreement

The exit from the embassy that best resolves issues to the benefit of the United States and Venezuela is a mutual Protecting Power Agreement. The United States wants a Protecting Power for its embassy in Caracas. Venezuela wants a Protecting Power for its embassy in DC. Such agreements are not uncommon when diplomatic relations are severed.

A Protecting Power Agreement would avoid a military conflict that could lead to war. A war in Venezuela would be catastrophic for Venezuela, the United States, and for the region. It would lead to lives lost and mass migration from the chaos and conflict of war. It would cost the United States trillions of dollars and become a quagmire involving allied countries around the world.

We are serving as interim protectors in the hope that the two nations can negotiate this resolution. If this occurs we will take the banners off the building, pack our materials, and leave voluntarily. The electricity could be turned on and we will drive out.

We suggest a video walk-through with embassy officials to show that the Embassy Protection Collective did not damage the building. The only damage to the building has been inflicted by coup supporters in the course of their unprosecuted break-ins.

2. The United States violates the Vienna Convention, makes an illegal eviction and unlawful arrests

This approach will violate international law and is fraught with risks. The United States would have to cut the chains in the front door put up by embassy staff and violate the embassy. We have put up barriers there and at other entrances to protect us from constant break-ins and threats from the trespassers whom the police are permitting outside the embassy. The police's failure to protect the embassy and the US citizens inside has forced us to take these actions.

The Embassy Protectors will not barricade ourselves, or hide in the embassy in the event of an unlawful entry by police. We will gather together and peacefully assert our rights to remain in the building and uphold international law.

Any order to vacate based on a request by coup conspirators that lack governing authority will not be a lawful order. The coup has failed multiple times in Venezuela. The elected government is recognized by the Venezuelan courts under Venezuelan law and by the United Nations under international law. An order by the US-appointed coup plotters would not be legal.

Such an entry would put embassies around the world and in the United States at risk. We are concerned about US embassies and personnel around the world if the Vienna Convention is violated at this embassy. It would set a dangerous precedent that would likely be used against US embassies.

If an illegal eviction and unlawful arrests are made, we will hold all decision-makers in the chain of command and all officers who enforce unlawful orders accountable.

If there is a notice that we are trespassing and need to vacate the premises, please provide it to our attorney Mara Verhayden-Hilliard, copied on this memo.

We have taken care of this embassy and request a video tour of the building before any arrests.

We hope a wise and calm solution to this issue can be achieved so escalation of this conflict can avoided.

There is no need for the United States and Venezuela to be enemies. Resolving this embassy dispute diplomatically should lead to negotiations over other issues between the nations.

GreenParty,post,Peace process,kbc83b,faithslayer202,"""We're Green Inside & Outside"" ~ Pittsburgh Green Left","A classic of Green Party history, the ""Avocado Declaration"" by Peter Camejo. Some describe themselves as ""watermelons"": ""green on outside, red on inside"", meant to evoke more of a Marxist attitude. The [Avocado Declaration](https://www.marxists.org/archive/camejo/2004/avocadodeclaration.htm) states we're ""green inside & out""

&#x200B;

The Avocado attitude comes from the idea that Green socialism is its own tendency, different from other forms of socialism. Particularly when you look at influences like Murray Bookchin's social ecology, it's easy to see a different praxis than that suggested by Marxist orgs. Let's look at a few of the most standout parts of the Avocado Declaration and see how much applies to today still. (The original was written in early 2004).

&#x200B;

""History shows that the Democrats and Republicans are not two counter-posed forces but rather complementary halves of a single two-party system"" Camejo identifies the two parties taking on the same economic policy in about 1872; the two cooperate to prevent mass movements. ""Since the Civil War, without exception, the Democratic Party has opposed all mass struggles for democracy and social justice."" Camejo points out how Democrats have opposed all movements for civil & political rights, but revisionism pretends them to be ""champions"" of the people. ""When social justice, peace, or civil rights movements become massive in scale, ..., the Democratic Party begins to shift and presents itself as a supposed ally, always seeking to co-opt the movement, demobilize its forces, and block its development...""

&#x200B;

The GOP ""argues ideologically for policies benefiting the corporate rulers."" Democrats are different, ""It acts as a “broker” negotiating and selling influence among broad layers of the people to support the objectives of corporate rule.""

&#x200B;

""The Democratic Party’s core group of elected officials is rooted in careerists seeking self-promotion by offering to the corporate rulers their ability to control and deliver mass support. And to the people they offer some concessions..."" Careerists in the Democratic Party are those that learn to manipulate the masses with leftist-sounding language that co-opts people toward corporate positions while pretending to be opposition. ""One important value of the Democratic Party to the corporate world is that it makes the Republican Party possible through the maintenance of stability essential for business as usual by preventing a genuine mass opposition from developing.""

&#x200B;

""The Democratic Party preaches defeatism to the most oppressed and exploited. Nothing can be expected, nothing is possible but what exists, and what continues is betrayal of what could be with the argument of lesser evil. It’s the Republicans or us. Nothing else is possible."" Camejo focuses a bit on ""the rule of law"" which is a little confusing to me. While making good points about the aftermath of 9/11 and attacks on freedom, US Constitutional law was never particularly democratic to begin with so I don't quite see ""rule of law"" being so important. Camejo seems to be equating the ""rule of law"" with democracy, which isn't quite the same. But certainly we want democratic decision making respected, rather than authoritarian oligarchic rule. Camejo goes on to point out how the Democratic Party was overwhelmingly in favor of the Republican-proposed changes and attacks on democracy. Even the ""progressives"" voted for it, much as we're seeing today with new progressives like A.O.C. continuing to vote for imperialism.

&#x200B;

""The Democratic Party allows its lower level representatives to present themselves as opposed to the war. Some of its leaders have begun to take on an appearance of disagreeing with “how” the policies of Bush are being implemented."" Camejo essentially argues that the Democratic Party tolerates and even wants a few dissenters to keep up appearances, as long as the oligarchy knows it continues to maintain power in votes and actual decision making. ""Their political message is simple and clear: “No voice truly critical of the platform of the Republicans may be permitted; only the Democrats must appear as ‘opponents’ to the Republicans.”"" Democrats must have a monopoly on ""resistance"" so it can control the message. ""They have no objection to rightist, pro-war third-party candidates entering the race and promoting their views. They only oppose a voice for peace and the rule of law, like that of Ralph Nader in 2000."" This really hits home in 2020. Democrats worked hard to throw Howie Hawkins, the Green nominee, off the ballot in many states. Camejo notes that the purpose is specifically to prevent democracy & peace candidates. ""Never in the history of the United States has a magazine claiming to favor democracy run a front page article calling on an individual to not run for president""

Younger folks don't realize how popular Nader was, and how much corporate media had to smear him to stop him. ""For the Green Party there is nothing more important or effective long-term and short-term in stopping Bush than to expose how the corporate interests use their two-party system and the role of the Democrats in that system."" Camejo spends a few paragraphs discussing all the Democrat crossover to support Republicans and a corporate agenda within the Dems, and concludes that for Greens one important objective is exposing the corporate control of both parties and the system as a whole. Next Camejo comments on how the Democrats act as a ""self-correcting mechanism"" to upkeep two-party rule. ""Being Democrats they become part of a system that will have them removed if they do not follow the rules of support when corporate America insists.""

&#x200B;

""To rise in the Democratic Party there is a process that leads to compliant people unable to question, who remain silent before betrayals or criminal acts."" As mentioned earlier, the top ranks of the Democratic Party become full of careerists that learn to cater to corporations. More troublingly, this means anyone that plans a ""career"" in politics must ultimately fall in line or be kicked out of the party, the system, and the career. One must find a new job. Be wary of folks that seek a career in Democratic politics. ""Cynthia McKinney is an example of a Democrat who refused to go along, stepped across the line within the Democratic Party and was driven out of office by the combined efforts of both the Democratic and Republican parties and the corporate media."" McKinney actually became the Green presidential nominee in 2008, although did not receive a particularly high vote total. By this point ""Obamamania"" was sweeping the progressive movement. ""The self-purging process of the Democratic Party is an ongoing balance between allowing, even welcoming, voices of opposition in order to co-opt, but not allowing those voices to form a serious challenge..."" A callback to earlier where Camejo argued Dems \*like\* some dissent. A small amount of controlled dissent in a controlled primary allows the Democratic party to continue to pretend to be on the side of the people while consciously support & voting for the same corporate agenda as Republicans. ""The Democratic Party should be seen historically as the most successful political party in the history of the world in terms of maintaining stability for rule by the privileged few."" Camejo hits the nail on the head here. The Democrats are very successful at squashing dissent.

&#x200B;

""The Democratic Party through trickery co-opted the powerful and massive rise of the Populist movement at the end of the 19th century precisely using the same “lesser evil” arguments now presented against the Green Party."" This refers to Democrat efforts against unionizing and independent politics like the Socialist Party in the late 1800's. Democrats ordered state police & private armies (e.g., the Pinkertons) to attack union strongholds in places like Pittsburgh. The Socialist Party was rapidly growing and winning seats at all levels of government. S.P.U.S.A. had thousands of municipal officials, many state legislators, and even a couple of members of Congress at its height. Democrats colluded with Republicans to stop their growth. One, Dems joined Rs in creating Espionage/Sedition Acts, and jailed Socialist Party leaders for speaking out against war. They also collaborated to make the complex system of ballot access we see today, purposely designed to make independent politics as difficult as possible. ""They \[the Democratic Party\] blocked the formation of a mass Labor Party when the union movement rose in the 1930's."" As the Socialist Party was weakened, other attempts were made at Labor Parties and People's Parties, but they all failed as Democrats co-opted the movement. The biggest slap in the face was F.D.R. accepting the New Deal, which was a watered-down and mild version of the Socialist Party platform that was gaining traction. As F.D.R. put it, he ""saved capitalism"" by taking these steps to squash dissent and independent movements. ""They derailed, co-opted and dismantled the powerful civil rights movement, Vietnam anti-war movement and women’s liberation movement. They have even succeeded in establishing popular myths that they were once for labor, for civil rights and for peace."" While dismantling the radical messaging of these movements -- always much more about democracy and socialism than we read about in today's history books -- Democrats also like to claim that they stand FOR these things! Historically that wasn't exactly true. Democrats have never been leaders on any of these issues, and have often actually been obstructionists. Civil rights leaders including Martin Luther King complained about them. Unions and the environmental movement also saw opposition to their policies. M.L.K. famously wrote that the ""white moderate"" that wanted to ""set a timetable on another man's freedom"" was extremely frustrating to him and one of his biggest hurdles to overcome in the civil rights struggle.

&#x200B;

""If a massive opposition develops, if the Greens begin to win races and its following grows, the corporations will put more money behind the Democrats, the media will become more sympathetic to the Democrats, and promote its more “progressive” voices."" Camejo points to media. From the low point after Nader's 2000 run, Greens built up a new movement particularly with Jill Stein that was beginning to reach back toward Nader's numbers. Those growth numbers must have been making Democrats nervous. While Stein got some mild corporate media coverage in 2016 such as a CNN Town Hall, the 2020 Green candidate Howie Hawkins was completely locked out of all media while they focused on Bernie & A.O.C. As Camejo predicted, Democrats will ramp up media against perceived threats. ""The two-party system is a self-correcting mechanism that shifts back and forth between the two parties, and within different wings of those parties, to maintain corporate political control."" Camejo recognizing the surprising adaptability of this two-party arrangement. ""Loyalty to the two-party system is inculcated in the educational system, and our electoral laws are rigged to discriminate against third parties."" Folks that grow up and learn ""activism"" from the system learn loyalty to the two party system & grow to expect third party losses.

&#x200B;

“The assumption that what currently exists must necessarily exist is the acid that corrodes all visionary thinking.” \~ Murray Bookchin

&#x200B;

Camejo wraps up his essay by focusing on the ""lesser evil"" argument that is taught to today's activists. ""The call for a “lesser evil” is what makes possible the greater evil."" Those ""who say Nader should not run, that the Greens should consider withdrawing, that the Greens should not campaign in states where the vote is close are, unconsciously, actually helping Bush’s re-election by weakening the development of an opposition political movement..."" Camejo's comment here was actually directed at a number of Greens that took Nader's loss and subsequent labeling as a ""spoiler"" to heart. Afraid to meet the same fate as Nader, some Greens began arguing Greens should not run a presidential campaign, or campaign in ""safe states"". Sadly, the ""spoiler"" label did not exist much before 2000 (historically, it wasn't that weird at all for multiple candidates to run for president and even win electoral votes), but a few Greens helped make that pejorative stick by embracing it instead of fighting it. This disagreement is pretty well-documented in the book ""The Green Party Strategy Debate"" edited by Howie Hawkins. Hawkins advocated proudly running in every state, while some others did not. Most Greens wanted Nader to run again, but there was a vocal minority opposed. Long story short, Nader did not receive the nomination in 2004, instead a relative unknown David Cobb was the nominee. Cobb received only a fraction of Nader's votes, sadly helping both the ""spoiler"" label stick as well as giving a sense that Greens weren't growing. Ironically, folks working on the Bernie Sanders campaign have reported that Bernie desperately wanted to avoid Nader's fate, and that prompted him to avoid running as an independent. Similar to Cobb, he's sadly likely to fade into history as a result of not standing up.

&#x200B;

""Nothing is more important than the appearance of candidates and mass actions that tell the full truth, that call for the rule of law, respect for the Bill of Rights, and speak out for peace and social justice."" Returning to Camejo's point, it's clear we must run everywhere. ""There is nothing more threatening to the rule of the corporations than the consolidation of a party of hundreds of thousands of citizens, especially young people, that fearlessly tell the truth to the American people."" Youth are the future! Shameless plug for Young EcoSocialists. ""Only such a movement can in time become millions, then tens of millions and eventually win. But it is also the best strategy for the short term, to force a shift away from the direction being pursued today.""

&#x200B;

Lastly, Camejo comments on this perceived tension of short-term and long-term strategy. ""The idea there is a conflict between the short term and the long term is a cover for capitulation. It has been the endless argument of the Democrats against challenges to their policies.""

&#x200B;

""When independent movements appear they call on people to enter the Democratic Party and work from within. There is no time to go outside the two-party framework, they argue."" We see this every year when Democrats tell us ""This isn't the year to vote Green!"". When will it be? And here Camejo points out a huge hole in these arguments: ""This argument was made 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 25 years ago and, of course remains with us today. Millions have agreed there’s no time to do the right thing."" This isn't a temporary ""strategy"" but an excuse. To the Democratic Party establishment & their political supporters that benefit from the Neo-liberal system, there will NEVER be a ""right time"" to organize independently because they simply DON'T WANT IT. They like the system how it is, their job is to stop YOU from changing it.

&#x200B;

In 2020, we couldn't because Trump.

In 2018, we couldn't because Dems need to win the House.

In 2016, we couldn't because Trump again.

In 2014, we couldn't because Dems need the House.

In 2012, we couldn't because you're not going to oppose Obama are you??

See the pattern?

&#x200B;

This strategy has been an utter failure at preventing the advance of right-wing fascism, because it was never meant to prevent fascism, only to keep winning corporations more control and more profits. Both parties continue to OPENLY move more right-wing as a result. ""As a result the number of workers in unions has dropped from 37 per cent of the work force to 12 per cent as they politically subordinated themselves to the pro-corporate Democratic Party."" As activists worked ""within"", they lost their real independent political power. ""Rather than success, these movements have found the Democratic Party to be the burial ground for mass movements, and of third-party efforts that sought to defend the interest of the people throughout American history.""

&#x200B;

""Instead they should join with the Greens in a battle for democracy in the same manner in which many progressive Democrats in San Francisco rejected their party’s nomination for mayor and joined with the Greens..."" Progressive Dems need to join Greens, not the other way around. ""We need to suggest to “progressive” Democrats that they should concentrate their attacks on their leadership’s support for George Bush’s policies, and not on the Greens for telling the truth and actually fighting for the ideals many of these Democrats claim to hold."" Notice how many of these quotes could easily apply to today if you just substitute in the appropriate names. ""Progressives"" should concentrate on Trump's policies, not kicking Greens off the ballot for telling the truth and actually fighting for the ideals they claim to hold. ""The year 2004 will be a critical year for the Greens. The campaign of the Democrats will be powerful and to some extent effective. Some will abandon us but others will be attracted by our courage and our principled stance."" Again, substitute in 2020 or 2024 and still applies.

&#x200B;

""if we do not stand up..., fight them and defend our right to exist, to have our voice heard, to run candidates that expose the two-party system and the hypocrisy of the Democratic Party and its complicity with the Republicans, we will suffer the greatest lost of all."" This applies more than ever as climate change & social issues only grow more urgent. The change we need to make comes from establishing a truly democratic society, which means creating something new outside of today's system. The Green Party must be a step in that direction. We cannot believe in ourselves and rally enough people around democracy if we are afraid to stand up on these important issues and declare our independent from corporations the capitalist profit motive. We need a Green Party, because Greens are us. We need ourselves to be heroes. I didn't mean for this to be such a long thread; was actually going to write a blog post later and just drop a few comments but got really into it as I was reading along again for the first time in a while.

About how Nixon's Detente (his ending of hostilities with Russia) was sabotaged, resulting in U.S. taxpayers paying a huge price in Trillions & Trillions of tax dollars given 2 scheming ""Defense"" industry","""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA""; By Anne Hessing Cahn

Book review in the ""Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists"" January, 1999

No. 1, Vol. 55; Pg. 70

By Warnke, Paul C. (reviewer)

Killing Detente is a highly readable account of an ill-considered and maladroit exercise in intelligence reassessment that delayed--but did not derail--detente, the process of accommodation that occurred between Washington and Moscow in the mid-1970s.

In presenting her analysis of what became known as the Team B exercise, Anne Cahn uses her extensive experience in international affairs, a careful review of many previously unavailable documents, and interviews with key individuals involved in the affair. (I should disclose that I worked with the author at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Committee on National Security, and reviewed drafts of some chapters of her book.)

Shortly after Gerald Ford succeeded Richard Nixon, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) began to push for an alternative review of Soviet strategic capabilities, contending that the National Intelligence Estimates prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) might be understating Soviet strategic strength. Competent analysts, however, had criticized the CIA's reports as greatly **overstating** Soviet military expenditures. **[WhereIsFiber's note: The Soviets, now the Russians, have always spent a small fraction on defense compared to our wildly wasteful U.S. ""Defense"" budgets. The USA spends on ""Defense"" what the next 12 countries combined spend on defense. That's why our economy is just limping along and our national debt has skyrocketed to 19 Trillion, and dangerously rising.]**

In late 1975, then-CIA Director William Colby responded negatively to the PFIAB proposal and disagreed with its contention that the agency's intelligence estimates erred by ""projecting a sense of complacency."" But President Ford, engaged as he was with Ronald Reagan's challenge for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination, was sensitive to possible fight-wing criticism. He eventually authorized the Team B adventure.

The initial idea was to appoint three panels of outside experts that would assess, respectively, the threat to U.S. ICBM survival created by Soviet missile accuracy, the Soviet anti-submarine warfare capability against U.S. nuclear missile submarines, and the extent to which Soviet air defenses could prevent penetration by strategic bombers.

The navy, however, considered information about the operational aspects of submarine patrols and whether they might be trailed by Soviet assets as information that could not be shared, even with the CIA. The second panel, accordingly, was reoriented to deal with Soviet strategic objectives. It is the work of this panel that is generally referred to as the Team B Report.

Whatever might be said for evaluation of strategic capabilities by a group of outside experts, the impracticality of achieving useful results by ""independent"" analysis of strategic objectives should have been self-evident. Moreover, the futility of the Team B enterprise was assured by the selection of the panel's members. Rather than including a diversity of views, as was recently done in putting together the, so-called Rumsfeld Commission on the ballistic missile threat, the Strategic Objectives Panel was composed entirely of individuals who had made careers of viewing the Soviet menace with alarm.

As the author notes, the panel's chairman, Richard Pipes, has been called the ""intellectual godfather"" of the thesis that the Soviets had rejected nuclear parity and were bent on fighting a nuclear war. **[My note: This is laughable.]** In an interview, Pipes told Cahn that he wrote most of the first section of the report, which criticized the CIA for underestimating the ""intensity, scope, and implicit threat"" posed by the Soviet Union, by using evidence relating to capabilities rather than intentions. This section argued that the really important evidence demonstrated that ""Soviet leaders are first and foremost offensively rather than defensively minded."" **[Note: Haha, if you're going to waste Trillions of U.S. taxpayers' money on ""Defense,"" you need a big boogeyman/bogeyman, a scary ""enemy,"" a phantom menace. The reality is the U.S. foisted the Cold War on the Russians.  The Russians wanted to be our ally, just like the French are our ally.  In fact, the Russians were our allies during World War 2 against the Nazis.  After World War 2, U.S. war mongers started the Cold War against Russia.  No less than double Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling has said the Soviets/Russians did not want the Cold War.]**

It is now entirely clear, however, that by the early 1970s Soviet leaders had concluded that the Soviet Union could not win, and might not even survive, a nuclear war. Anyone thereafter dealing with Soviet officials could readily recognize that they held no illusions about having military superiority over the United States and its allies. They were completely aware that NATO was a security alliance with a solidarity and common purpose that could not be ascribed to the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact. Even the dullest of Soviet leaders must have known that a limited nuclear war would almost certainly have meant the destruction of the Kremlin--and thus of the Soviet empire.

Detente was not doing too well when Team B met in 1975. It had been badly damaged by the U.S.-Soviet confrontation precipitated in 1973 by the Israeli-Egyptian war. In October of that year, the encirclement of Egypt's Third Army by Israeli defense forces prompted Leonid Brezhnev to call for joint U.S.-Soviet intervention to stop the fighting. Otherwise, suggested the Soviet premier, the Soviet Union might consider acting alone. In response to this muted threat, the United States called a worldwide alert of both its conventional and nuclear forces.

Although the crisis soon passed, it cast a continuing chill on the dialogue between Washington and Moscow. The Team B Report was a further blow to detente and, as the author observes, it provided ""intellectual fodder"" for the Committee on the Present Danger, which was spearheaded by former Undersecretary of State Eugene Rostow. In its first policy statement, released two days after the 1976 presidential election, the committee stated that ""the principal threat to our nation, to world peace, and to the cause of human freedom is the Soviet drive for dominance based upon an unparalleled military buildup."" **[Lol. You accuse your ""enemy"" of what you, yourself, are most guilty.]** The Soviet Union, the committee concluded, ""has not altered its long-held goal of a world dominated from a single center--Moscow."" **[The jokes keep coming.]**

Not surprisingly, the founding board members of the Committee on the Present Danger included Team B members Richard Pipes, Foy Kohler, Paul Nitze, and William Van Cleave. When Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, Pipes was named the president's special adviser on the Soviet Union and, in a masterpiece of miscasting, Eugene Rostow, the motivating force behind the Committee on the Present Danger, became director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.

Fortunately, Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power and the rapport he developed with Ronald Reagan, beginning with their first meeting in Geneva in 1985, put an end to superpower confrontation politics and, in a few years, to the Soviet Union itself. In the interest of fairness, I must note that Team B member Paul Nitze played a constructive role in that process as arms control adviser to Secretary of State George Shultz.

Although detente in the long run survived the right-wing attack, **[this book was published in 1998 during Bill Clinton's presidency, so, no, detente did not survive the Bush/Cheney regime and the ""Project For a New American Century,"" the 21st Century's equivalent of the anti-Nixon, anti-detente ""Team B"" liars]** the painful consequences of the Team B affair can still be felt in the diversion of massive funds from genuine human needs to a grossly excessive U.S. military buildup.

""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA"" author Anne Cahn voices warm appreciation for the legal work that gave her access to previously undisclosed documents through the Freedom of Information Act. But it is the author's thoughtful analysis of these documents and her searching interviews with key players that give Killing Detente its scope and depth.

Previously we knew little about the Team B Strategic Objectives Panel apart from its report. We now know that the way its members were selected and the manner in which it operated virtually preordained its conclusions. Not only is Anne Cahn's book of historical interest and useful as a teaching tool, but it is also a valuable study of how not to set defense policy.

It is important to realize we have had two parties of the millionaires governing the United States since its founding. People have always had to pick between which of the millionaire parties we should choose from when neither put the people's interests first. Some people have found a successful third way that builds people's power.

Those in the [**Green Party**](https://www.gp.org/) view popular movements and third-party candidates (who cannot win elections in this rigged system) working together to change the direction of the country. We would rather vote for what we want and not get it in an election but use our vote to build a national consensus for the changes we need. That is a better alternative than voting for what we do not want, i.e. ""a certifiable, lying, murdering war criminal"" and a racist mass incarcerator, and getting it.

This [**emphasis on popular movements**](https://www.gp.org/we_stand) is the key difference between those building eco-socialist alternative parties like the Green Party, and those who actively or tacitly support the Democrat Party which deliberately deactivates mass movements such as Obama quashing the black players’ wildcat strikes or the DNC twice, suppressing at all cost the Sanders campaigns and the vibrant mass of youth and people of color which built a movement around them to lift Sanders’ democratic socialist platform in 2016 and 2020.

Socialists understand that movements of the people are what change the conditions of our class. Those who remain shackled election after election to the corporate parties do not have faith in ordinary people, instead relying on corporate politicians to change the conditions that keep 99% of the world’s population down, with most unable to thrive and lacking in their basic needs.

Relying on capitalists in capitalist parties who preserve the needs of capitalism and corporate profit to make the fundamental changes needed to have an equitable and just and non-racist society is what spoils elections, and spoils our chances for a better world.  

The history of ending slavery, ending child labor, winning the 8-hour workday and union rights, breaking up monopolies (trust-busting), women’s voting rights, ending alcohol prohibition and winning the New Deal – came from the platforms of the Socialist and Progressive parties and were won through social movements.

In this century, it was [**Ralph Nader**](https://twitter.com/RalphNader) who ran on single payer, Medicare for All, and [**Jill Stein**](https://twitter.com/DrJillStein) who ran on the Green New Deal (after [**Howie Hawkins**](http://www.howiehawkins.com/2010/media-releases/290-green-new-deal-would-invest-in-renewable-energy-for-jobs-economic-recovery-and-climate-stability.html) first did so at the state-level in 2010). Every Green candidate has called for raising the minimum wage and taxing the wealthy.

This year we are facing multiple crises and the bi-partisan failed state of the two millionaire parties is handing none of them well: the pandemic, the economic collapse, racist police violence, and climate chaos, as well as the long-simmering deadly crises of inequality, inadequate healthcare, and a renewed nuclear arms race. Only one presidential ticket is right on ALL of these issues and that is Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker.

Voting for Biden is immoral in the current electoral reality. Trump is the worst president in our lifetimes and has to be removed from office.  Unfortunately, U.S. presidential elections are determined by the Electoral College so battleground or swing states are the key to winning. [**Because the presidential ​voting system assigns each state a number of electoral college votes**](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/sep/02/electoral-college-explained-biden-uphill-battle-us-election), which​ go to the state’s victor regardless of the​ margin of victory, a handful of swing states will ​probably decide the election and are targeted heavily by the corporate parties, commonly ignoring voters in the remaining 38-42 other states. The swing states are comprised of mixed populations (urban, suburban, rural, etc.) and tend to flip between red and blue each election cycle. They include Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin.

Six battleground states that are close calls right now are interesting because they are all Republican states. The fact that these are now the only battleground states shows Trump is fighting off a landslide defeat — a well-deserved landslide. Swing states will not determine who wins, but whether there is an anti-Trump landslide.

The trends are not good for Trump. But no matter what happens with the polls, people who live in states like New York, California, Maryland, and the other 30 solidly Democratic states would be wasting their vote if they vote for Biden. A vote for Biden does not stand for Medicare for all, the Green New Deal, a public health approach to the pandemic, or ending the never-ending wars. Biden votes get lost in the corporate Democratic agenda of Joe Biden.

Republicans spoil elections by suppressing the Democratic vote and the Black vote. They orchestrate voter roll purges, most notably in the 2000 election in Florida, and restrict the number of polling places in Black and Brown communities. The GOP encourages voter intimidation at polling places.

Democrats spoil elections by trying to suppress the progressive Green vote, kicking us off the ballot instead of fighting in-between elections to replace the Electoral College with a national popular vote using ranked choice voting.

Campaign financing is paid by [**billionaires**](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/15/politics/election-2020-campaign-finance-mike-bloomberg-trump/index.html) and corporations in support of both major parties so that the [super wealthy control](https://time.com/4182502/campaign-finance-reform/) our elections.

The GOP’s active [**suppression of the Black vote**](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fight-vote-black-activists-work-upend-history-voter/story?id=71345180) and the Electoral College’s anointing candidates who actually lost the popular vote spoils elections. Campaign financing and gerrymandering spoil elections. The election process in this country is a rotted mess that only benefits corporations, the wealthy and the corporate duopoly. Sadly, it’s a spoiled system whether the Green Party runs candidates or not.

Only voting for Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker makes sense in 2020 with two terrible candidates — the worst president of our lives and one of the worst corporate Democrats of our lives. We are not limited to those candidates.

[**Howie Hawkins**](https://howiehawkins.us/about-howie/) is a retired Teamster construction and warehouse worker who has been active in movements for civil rights, peace, unions, and the environment since the 1960s. He was the first U.S. politician to campaign for a Green New Deal in 2010, in the first of three consecutive runs for New York governor. New York enacted several policies that only Hawkins had campaigned for after he received 5% of the vote in 2014, including a ban on fracking, a $15 minimum wage, and paid family leave. Vice-presidential candidate [**Angela Walker**](https://howiehawkins.us/about-angela-walker/) is a truck driver in Florence, South Carolina, a veteran and a union and racial justice activist.

We need to vote for candidates who represent and are part of the popular movements so we advance the causes of economic, racial and environmental justice. This is why I’m voting Green.

GreenParty,post,Peace process,h80y4u,Bane0fExistence,"Creating jobs is meaningless, we should invest in education, automation, universal basic income, and equality across humanity.","Hey all, first post here and I'm not sure if it fits. Mods feel free to remove if I'm mistaken. 

So many of today’s politics are conflicted with double standards. Everyone praises the “leader” who can also wear the hat of “job creator”, as if creating multitudes of meaningless and menial “jobs” is enough to get a pat on the back. They also get praise for keeping said “jobs” in the US, like that’s some sort of gold standard, when in reality it goes against all of their other capitalist values. Why should we work to keep jobs in America when the natural flow of the market decides that outsourcing jobs where they’re more valued by the people who have them is what needs to happen?  Why do they preach the merits of laissez-faire economics and “allowing the market to decide” when they so clearly go against that? It’s hindering our society in so many ridiculous ways. So ridiculous that this system needs to be changed. 

I propose we do exactly as they say they want for once, we should “laissez-faire” with a vengeance, let all the jobs naturally diffuse where they may and let automation take over the rest. Instead of constantly fighting with the system we made and patching its gaping holes, we should finally allow it to reach its inevitable equilibrium and work in tune with it. We’re struggling against yet another one of our created systems, when we have the ability to change exactly how it works. All of this nonsense is human generated, so it can also be radically torn down and rebuilt by humans as well. When the far out-dated “blue collar jobs” are all replaced by robotic arms, machine learning, and computer vision, only specialized work will be truly valued. I believe this will encourage the influx of a generation of people born to think and challenge the way things are, the real “job creators”, who do what we Americans so often claim we are “the best at”. They’ll be the innovators, the entrepreneurs, the ones to drag the slow human race kicking and screaming to the stars. 

I know some of you are already thinking about what happens to the blue collars who are too old to learn anything new and just want to retire, well that’s what the magical idea of a Universal Basic Income is all about. People who are being phased out by automation have to make a living somehow and the factory owners with all the robots aren’t paying anyone for the blue collar jobs anymore. A portion of that increased revenue can go to taxes to fund the people who lost their jobs. The people who have now gained the freedom to express themselves in ways they couldn’t imagine when they were chained to their menial 8 hour day jobs. They can be free to find a purpose \*worth\* pursuing, not just try to stay alive and keep their family fed. Is the idea of a social safety net really too far out there? We have the capacity to make sure that no child in the world goes unfed, no mother goes homeless, and no father breaks his back, but we choose to avoid this time and again. 

It’s ridiculous that our economy has become this death cult centered around working just for the sake of working and making a few people just that much richer. Arguing against automation or artificially slowing its advance when we have the technology is beyond asinine and encourages workplace injuries for our equally asinine healthcare system to take care of. Plus it makes people just that much more depressed with their lives. You’ve all seen/experienced working from home during this pandemic right? You’ve seen all the people saying, “Wait, I actually like this. Can we work from home more often?” That’s because people are actually happy for once. They were in charge of their own time with no manager or boss breathing down their neck, just a task to finish at their own pace. No commuting to burn the planet down, less waste to hasten that effect, and a more energy efficient society was created, fleeting as it may be. 

We shouldn’t look at UBI like the politicians would want us to, like extra “welfare” designed to have more people draining the system for themselves. That’s the narrative of a few they push so they can save all the money for the corporations guilty of exactly that. Think of it as subsidizing the people so they are free to do as they want. We could guarantee so many things as human rights and make so much progress in the process. An injury could finally not mean a death sentence, be it financial or literal. A missed utility bill could be a thing of the past when utilities are all guaranteed. Starvation wages could be starved out themselves. A college degree could be more than just a paper worth five or six cars. People could finally follow their passions and create a healthier, more fulfilling society because of it. Maybe this might be taking things too far, but with a happier society, maybe crime itself would diminish and along with it, the prison industrial system thriving off of actual slave labor. We could have a truly \*just\* justice system designed for rehabilitation and eventual full reintegration into society. 

We wouldn’t want for wars or invest billions in gaudy displays of military strength. We wouldn’t care for oil when we’re able to solve the energy crisis. We wouldn’t need to worry about competing with other countries when we’re just focusing on fixing our own issues and when we’re ready, we can make our return to the global community not as a laughing stock or a bully, but as an equal partner on this planet where we can work to establish the same rights we fight for across the human race. 

Until that time, we are stuck with what we have. The starvation wages that are one of so many symptoms stemming from this disease our country has and will continue to spread. The healthcare system will continue to exploit the masses. The politicians will act bemused and concerned when they hear our cries of “more jobs!” or, “No justice! No Peace!”, but they will hear none of it. They knew this was inevitable. Our healthcare workers are donning trash bags with duct tape to prevent the spread of a virus politicians don’t care about while they outfit the police with military grade hardware and of course, military grade air filters for their tear gas. Those filters could have very easily been redirected to hospitals the moment a pandemic was detected, but the people in charge decided that they were more valuable sitting in a warehouse with all the riot gear for when it all hits the fan. 

In case that last sentence didn’t sink in, THEY HAD FILTERS BUT CHOSE NOT TO USE THEM. 

The hundred thousand deaths in America are on the hands of every last person who could have made that decision, but chose not to. 

The blood of every person mauled by police is on their hands too. 

They knew the consequences of their actions and they have been well aware of them for a long time. It’s time we stop playing their games and start taking our lives back. As controversial as this may be, voting has proved itself to be an empty voice time and again to pacify the masses and say, “It’s okay, at least you tried.” when the people choose a candidate the establishment doesn’t want, they’ll play every trick in the damn book to make sure they get their way. They’ll rig the primaries. They’ll “lose” some ballots and invalidate some others on technicalities. They’ll gerrymander the counties and the electoral college will \*really\* decide who gets in that damn office. There is no way to win, so we make our own way. We abolish the police. We fight. We rebel. We kick and scream until they are no longer in office or the office no longer exists. I’m sorry to say to all of you, but the evidence is clear and has been for a long time, that the system isn’t just or right. It isn’t fair or compassionate. It isn’t \*human\*. Most of all, it fucking \*hates\* you. 

We are the shareholders in this country and we have the right to remake this system in whatever way we see fit. Our politicians should not be 60+ years old and asking Mark Zuckerberg what a “Facebook” is when he’s caught violating the privacy of millions. We need an educated government reinvented for this technological age designed for all its people. We should not have a single person in office who thinks that the complete abolishment and reinvention of the police force is an overreaction. We should also not have anyone in power who views people of a different skin color to be less than human and we should not encourage that in our society. I know some of you have seen them too, the closet racists who had been hiding in the shadows for so long until that day in 2016 when they could all come out. They revealed themselves to be our neighbors, our friends, our parents, and our leaders. As a person who is not considered a person by these people, I know what it’s like to have my white friends come to me “joking” about how I should “pick the white side in the race war!” or talk about their discord server for white people only. I know what it’s like to have my black mother threaten me with police execution simply for wanting to move out. I also know what it’s like to have my white father proudly state that I don’t “act black”, whatever that means. As a person who is split right down the middle of this issue of “black and white” (quite literally if you haven’t figured that out yet), I know what it feels like to not truly belong to either “side”. I, as an American citizen with equal rights, demand the creation of a society where everyone can feel like they belong. Is that too much to ask for?

GreenParty,post,Peace process,1qgctb,greenpartyoffice,Suggestions for revising the health care section of the Green Party platform?,"OTHER THAN the removal of homeopathy?


""F. Health Care

The Green Party supports single-payer universal health care and preventive care for all. We believe that health care is a right, not a privilege.

Our current health care system lets tens of thousands of people die each year by excluding them from adequate care, while its exorbitant costs are crippling our economy. The United States is the only industrialized nation in the world without a national health care system.

Under a universal, comprehensive, national single-payer health care system, the administrative waste of private insurance corporations would be redirected to patient care. If the United States were to shift to a system of universal coverage and a single payer plan, as in Canada and many European countries, the savings in administrative costs would be more than enough to offset the cost of additional care. Expenses for businesses currently providing coverage would be reduced, while state and local governments would pay less because they would receive reimbursement for services provided to the previously unin­sured, and because public programs would cease to be the ""dumping ground"" for high-risk patients and those rejected by health maintenance organizations (HMOs) when they become disabled and unemployed. In addition, people would gain the peace of mind in knowing that they have health care they need. No longer would people have to worry about the prospect of financial ruin if they become seriously ill, are laid off their jobs, or are injured in an accident.

Greens support a wide-range of health care services, not just traditional medicine which too often emphasizes ""a medical arms race"" that relies upon high-tech intervention, surgical techniques and costly pharmaceuticals. Chronic conditions are often best cured by alternative medicine. We support the teaching, funding and practice of holistic health approaches and as appropriate, the use of complementary and alternative therapies such as herbal medicines, homeopathy, naturopathy, traditional Chinese medicine and other healing approaches.

Greens recognize that our own health is also intimately tied to the health of our communities and environment. To improve our own health, we must improve the quality of our air, water and food and the health of our workplaces, homes and schools.

The Green Party unequivocally supports a woman's right to reproductive choice, no matter her marital status or age, and that contraception and safe, legal abortion procedures be available on demand and be included in all health insurance coverage in the U.S., as well as free of charge in any state where a woman's income falls below the poverty level. [See section A.1. Women's Rights in this chapter]

We recommend the following actions:

1. Single-Payer Health Care

Enact a universal, comprehensive, national single-payer health plan that will provide the following with no increase in cost:

a. A publicly funded health care insurance program, administered at the state and local levels, with comprehensive lifetime benefits, including dental, vision, mental health care, substance abuse treatment, medication coverage, and hospice and long-term care;

b. Participation of all licensed and/or certified health pro­viders, subject to standards of practice in their field, with the freedom of patients to choose the type of health care provider from a wide range of health care choices, and with decision-making in the hands of patients and their health providers, not insurance companies;

c. Portability of coverage regardless of geographical location or employment;

d. Cost controls via streamlined administration, national fee schedules, bulk purchases of drugs and medical equipment, coordination of capital expenditures and publicly negotiated prices of medications;

e. Primary and preventive care as priorities, including wellness education about diet, nutrition and exercise; Holistic health including homeopathy, naturopathic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, herbalism and medical marijuana;

f. More comprehensive services for those who have special needs, including the mentally ill, the differently abled and those who are terminally ill;

g. A mental health care system that safeguards human dignity, respects individual autonomy, and protects informed consent;

h. Greatly reduced paperwork for both patients and pro­viders;

i. Fair and full reimbursement to providers for their services;

j. Hospitals that can afford safe and adequate staffing levels of registered nurses;

k. Establishment of national, state, and local health policy boards consisting of health consumers and providers to oversee and evaluate the performance of the system, ensure access to care, and help determine research priorities; and

l. Establishment of a National Health Trust Fund that would channel all current Federal payments for health care programs directly into the Fund, in addition to employees' health premium payments.

2. AIDS / HIV

The Green Party calls for comprehensive, humane, and competent care of all people with AIDS/HIV.

An all-out campaign must be waged against AIDS/ HIV and other blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis. The AIDS epidemic has not been adequately addressed at the local, state, federal, or international levels. All people in all countries, including those with AIDS/HIV, have a right to medical care, protection from discrimination, and confidentiality.

Drug corporations have a strong profit motivation to make this disease a manageable one (like diabetes) with guaranteed sales of very expensive drugs, in the billions of dollars every year. Drug companies have not emphasized research that targets a cure. While new drugs have dramatically saved lives, many have side effects so debilitating that the quality of life is poor, if not intolerable during the extended lifetime of the patient. But even these need to be produced generically to stop the devastation resulting from corporate refusal to provide these drugs to the millions dying throughout the world who cannot afford these basic lifesaving drugs. Drug researchers should have a cure for AIDS as their ultimate goal.

We recommend the following actions:

a. Increased funding for AIDS education and patient care.

b. Increased funding for comprehensive sex education that includes AIDS education.

c. Increased funding for research focusing on a cure, methods of prevention, and on bolstering the immune system.

d. Improved technology, facilities, laboratories, researchers, staff and personnel to cure AIDS/HIV. A ""Manhattan Project"" for a cure is required.

e. Complete sharing of information among researchers, funding agencies (including corporations), and the public on AIDS/HIV before awarding the next research grant.

f. More research into better methods of prevention of HIV infection. While we support condom use, better condoms are also required. We support more vaccine research as well as research on prevention methods such as microbicides. People must be provided the means and support to protect themselves from all sexually transmitted diseases.

g. Equal access to AIDS education, treatment and medications for all affected. Accordingly, funding and accountability should be increased.

h. Allowing all prisoners affected with AIDS/HIV in all countries to have the same access as free citizens to education, treatment, preventive measures (including condom use), and medical care.

i. A uniform international definition of AIDS.

j. Protecting the confidentiality of all people diagnosed with AIDS/HIV or tested for HIV.

k. More careful and timely approval of effective AIDS drugs by the FDA.

l. Production of affordable and available versions of patented medicines in all countries.

m. Targeting the young for age-appropriate education about AIDS/HIV and appropriate methods of prevention. We support sex education and the distribution of condoms in schools.

n. Prevention awareness and access to condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS. We condemn HIV-related discrimination.

o. Make drug treatment and other programs available for all addicts who seek help.

p. Expand clinical trials for treatments and vaccines.

q. Speed-up the FDA drug approval process.

r. Providing housing for homeless and poor people with AIDS/HIV.

s. Providing treatment for homeless people with AIDS/ HIV.

t. Support for needle exchange programs and for programs to help drug addicts.

u. No mandatory screening for AIDS/HIV; anonymous screening must be available.

v. Lifting the ban prohibiting HIV positive people from entering the U.S. as visitors or as immigrants.""",2013-11-12T13:37:18+00:00

**By Haig Hovaness**

In the early 20th century, the development of mass communications propaganda enhanced the ability of governments to secure public support for waging war. In America, WWI was “sold” to the public by a carefully planned public relations campaign directed by early pioneers of opinion manipulation, such as [**Edward Bernays**](https://books.google.com/books?id=GarJLYMm3A0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false). In 1928 Bernays published a definitive book, “[**Propaganda**](https://www.voltairenet.org/IMG/pdf/Bernays_Propaganda_in_english_.pdf?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=908ac22b5b3153119dd27abdc2d882106e3460e9-1579901586-0-AXdJdtfgGF_YReIjejCvpobTq_ncp7plmJfDv1uuB3XFONymKliFWcCmCJV98JziFMoaUst7fFWixBTvszzgWoGYLpScSLIdWcIZuKS6TfF0OnZ4PnuJ7msP1NAFLiqtB4MBunMy5-k9QNEDhY0tRIS9REbDRPl0nNiqT1pv3D-3X7OWK28yiNxOUtmBGdfxE_Bm_50cgnJTonmgiffl-R_GJW86fxR21TbhgVm_tyPTbqxdIRJRWpM3Jeg3MaE00szle4ExUeec1WCz14iJHzKat4WOQkP9QAceJoj0bvpHd21CqMBy8uKITzXhgLqZbQ),” on the new science of influencing the public. In this book, he declares the purpose of this science bluntly:

*The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, and our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of…. It is they who pull the wires that control the public mind.*

Soon thereafter European dictators, like Hitler and Mussolini, used the tools of propaganda to rise to power and launch a terrible war. What the early students of propaganda did not foresee was that a time would come when the mechanisms of propaganda would no longer be subservient to the national objectives of powerful leaders but would become a dominant influence on the conduct of nations. This inversion of policy and propaganda is a fundamental reason why America’s “War on Terror” has become detached from rational policy objectives and serves as a kind of theater of cruelty for the amusement of the public, much like the bloody spectacles of the ancient Roman arena. In short, propaganda, which was invented as a tool to serve powerful leaders now dictates the actions of the leaders. Americans have become trapped in a world in which the propaganda of inciting irrational fear and hostility has become self-perpetuating, leading to an endless public spectacle called a war.

The German military theorist Clausewitz called war “a continuation of politics with the admixture of other means.” By this he meant that after exhausting the resources of diplomacy nations may turn to war, but war should serve a nation’s interests. Today’s American War on Terror defies logical connection to any sound national interests. America’s invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq are widely considered disastrous failures, and our military interventions in Libya, Syria and several other troubled nations have spread chaos and anarchy. These military adventures do, however, entertain the public. The evidence for this entertainment mechanism is the repeating patterns of the propaganda spectacles that are presented. Here are some examples:

### Humiliating the captives – Guantanamo

In ancient Rome the parading of defeated captives was a part of the marches of triumph that celebrated victorious military campaigns. The triumphal procession would include caged or shackled captives, whose humiliation excited and pleased the Roman crowds. The US imprisoned suspected terrorists at Guantanamo, a military base in Cuba, presumed to be outside the legal jurisdiction of US Courts. Pictures of the shackled kneeling prisoners were widely publicized, as were descriptions of the harsh conditions of confinement and interrogation at Guantanamo. This pleased a public hungry for revenge after the shock of the 9/11 attacks. The crucial distinction between the practice of the Romans and the US in the display of captives is that the Romans did so after securing strategic triumphs like the conquest of Gaul. There has been no equivalent triumph in the open-ended US global War on Terror. It is widely believed that the abuse of prisoners at Guantanamo and other sites has helped recruit Islamist militants worldwide. Even as a legal stratagem for punishing accused terrorists, Guantanamo has been a failure, since the maltreatment of the prisoners renders their prosecution untenable, leaving many of these prisoners in a legal limbo, possibly for the remainder of their lives.

Although President Obama campaigned on a promise to close the Guantanamo prison, he was unable to persuade Congress to do this. I believe the only credible explanation for this recalcitrance was the desire to maintain the public propaganda benefit of ritual humiliation of (suspected) terrorists: propaganda driving irrational policy.

### Brandishing the weaponry – Shock, Awe, and MOAB

A U.S. aircraft dropped a GBU-43 Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb, also known as a MOAB or ‘mother of all bombs’, on an area in the Achin district of Nangarhar province, Afghanistan, on April 13, 2017. The MOAB is a ten-ton bomb, the largest conventional weapon in the US arsenal. The dropping of this bomb had no effect whatever on the strategic situation of the US military intervention in Afghanistan, now in its 19th year. America lacks the military resources to fully suppress the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan which controls about two-thirds of the population and continues to inflict defeats on the US-backed Afghan government. The bomb did have significant propaganda value, however, because the images and videos of the effects of this weapon were widely reported.

The great danger of reliance on super weapon propaganda is that leaders may come to believe it. The use of super weapons to bolster public morale in a losing war was notable in WWII Germany. The German V1 cruise missile and V2 ballistic missile were revolutionary pilotless bombs that Hitler mistakenly believed would win the war. President Trump has boasted that he could win the war in Afghanistan by killing millions of Afghans, presumably with indiscriminate use of advanced American weaponry. Our super-weapons pose a greater threat to us than to our enemies: propaganda driving irrational policy.

### Killing the Supervillains – Bin Laden, Al Baghdadi, and Soleimani

In Orwell’s prescient dystopian novel, “1984,” a key tool of state propaganda is focusing public rage on an archvillain who is responsible for all the evils of the nation’s enemy. In the novel, there is a daily assembly in which members of the public witness a video depiction of Emmanuel Goldstein, the leader of the enemy state. For two minutes, the audience is whipped into a frenzy of hatred that sustains their war fervor. In America’s War on Terror, a succession of supervillains has served a powerful propaganda purpose: Bin-Laden, Al-Baghdadi, and most recently Soleimani have been killed to symbolically defeat an ill-defined adversary power (terrorism). Yet the endless war continues.

From a strategic perspective, the killings of Bin-Laden and Al-Baghdadi, founders of Al Qaeda and ISIS, were irrelevant because these leaders had fled into hiding and no longer commanded significant forces. Killing Soleimani, the Iranian general aiding anti-American forces in the Mideast, was a strategic disaster because it brought the US and Iran to the brink of a full-scale war and persuaded the Iraqi parliament to request the departure of the remaining US troops in Iraq. Nonetheless, Trump is milking the propaganda value of the Soleimani assassination at political rallies, irrespective of the negative consequences for the US position in the Mideast: propaganda driving irrational policy.

The failures of US foreign policy in the global War on Terror have become so conspicuous that there is growing organized criticism of this reign of misrule. Recently the [**Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft**](https://quincyinst.org/) was formed by support from wealthy activists from opposite ends of the political spectrum (Charles Koch and George Soros). The first paragraph of the [**institute’s charter addresses**](https://quincyinst.org/about/) the problem succinctly:

*The foreign policy of the United States has become detached from any defensible conception of U.S. interests and from a decent respect for the rights and dignity of humankind. Political leaders have increasingly deployed the military in a costly, counterproductive, and indiscriminate manner, normalizing war and treating armed dominance as an end in itself.*

I assert that a main reason why military conflict has become an end in itself is that the propaganda associated with the War on Terror is out of control and is now dictating irrational and counterproductive actions. War propaganda, once a servant of American politicians, has now become a master. Taming this monstrous former servant will be a crucial challenge for American democracy.

This is a pivotal point in history...

What can we learn from the Second World War?

A  historical  example  of  success  at  the  level  of  effort  required  to  confront  the  climate  crisis  was  that  of  the  Allies  taking  on  fascism  and  Hitler’s  ruthless  expansionistic  regime.  What  the  Allied  efforts  in  the  Second  World War can tell us is the following: Giving up is not an option. Political courage is needed. Incremental actions cannot meet the challenge.For five days in May 1940, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was surrounded by military advisors, senior civil servants and Cabinet members demanding that he negotiate terms of surrender with Hitler.

The facts were very bleak. The details were not shared with the British public but citizens knew that much was amiss. The British government prepared a daily report on public morale.  In May 1940, “fatalism (was) on the rise...and women, in particular, have stopped listening to the wireless.”The entire British army was pinned down on a beach in northern France, at Dunkirk. France had just surrender-dered. England’s coastline was essentially defenseless. Gun turrets along the coast were under construction – hoping to fool German aircraft pilots by using telephone poles instead of guns. The US government refused to engage. Churchill was told there was no hope.Then he thought of something. How many civilian vessels are there in Dover?  Just across the English Channel were 861 civilian boats – fishing boats, ferries, vessels of all kinds.  And this is why the Dunkirk story matters – it was not possible, but it happened. Those 861 boats rescued over 300,000 men. Sadly, 243 of these boats were sunk by German fire, but still the entire British army and tens of thousands of French soldiers were rescued. An evacuation against all odds inspired a nation on the verge of surrender to oppose Hitler – and win.Such  leadership  has  a  phenomenal  impact  on  morale.  C.S.  Lewis,  theologian  and  author  of  the  Narnia  Chronicles,wrote in his diary, “I find that everyone I meet feels so much more encouraged now that things are so much worse.”Facing facts and organizing ourselves to confront a challenge is how we will build a robust and resilient society in the face of a changing climate – in Canada and around the world. In the spirit of Dunkirk, we can ask ourselves, “What can I do with my little boat? Where and how do I pitch in?” As in all efforts to tackle big threats and long odds, we need all hands on deck

**Dunkirk**

&#x200B;

Dunkirk is a small town on the coast of France that was the scene of a massive military campaign during World War II. From May 26 to June 4, 1940, some 338,000 British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and other Allied troops were evacuated from Dunkirk to England as German forces closed in on them. The massive operation, involving hundreds of naval and civilian vessels, became known as the “Miracle of Dunkirk” and served as a turning point for the Allied war effort.

WHERE IS DUNKIRK?

Dunkirk is located in the north of France, on the shores of the North Sea near the Belgian-French border. The Strait of Dover, where the distance between England and France is just 21 miles across the English Channel, is located to the southwest.

Because of its seaside location near the borders of three European powers, Dunkirk (known as Dunkerque in French) and the surrounding area have been the site of centuries of commerce and travel, as well as numerous bloody battles.

BATTLE OF DUNKIRK

On May 10, 1940, the so-called “phony war” ended decisively when Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium in a blitzkrieg (German for “lightning war”) attack.

In the face of such a coordinated strategy, superior air power and highly mobile ground forces supported by panzer tanks, all three countries would succumb quickly: The Germans occupied Luxembourg on May 10, the Netherlands on May 14 and Belgium by the end of the month.

Soon after the blitzkrieg began, German forces invaded France—not along the Maginot Line, which the Allies had expected, but through the Ardennes Forest, moving steadily along the Somme Valley toward the English Channel.

As they advanced, German forces cut off all communication and transport between the northern and southern branches of Allied forces, pushing several hundred thousand Allied troops in the north into an increasingly small sliver of the French coast.

By May 19, General John Gort, commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had begun to weigh the possibility of evacuating his entire force by sea in order to save them from certain annihilation by the approaching Nazi troops.

WINSTON CHURCHILL

Meanwhile, in London, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain had resigned under pressure on May 13, making way for a new wartime coalition government headed by Winston Churchill. At first, British command opposed evacuation, and French forces wanted to hold out as well.

But with the BEF and its allies forced back on the French port of Dunkirk, located on the shores of the North Sea just 10 km (6.2 miles) from the Belgian border, Churchill soon became convinced evacuation was the only option.

ADOLF HITLER

In planning this risky operation, the Allies got a helping hand from a surprising source: Adolf Hitler, who on May 24 gave the order to halt the advance of German panzer divisions bearing down on Dunkirk.

Hitler’s decision has been attributed to his generals’ worries over a possible Allied counterattack (like the failed one on May 21 south of Arras) as well as Luftwaffe commander Hermann Goering’s insistence that his air forces could prevent any evacuation attempt at Dunkirk.

Hitler gave the tanks the go-ahead again on May 26, but by that time the Allies had gained crucial time to put their preparations in place.

OPERATION DYNAMO

On the evening of May 26, the British began the evacuation from Dunkirk, using the codename Operation Dynamo.

Vice Admiral Bertram Ramsay directed the efforts, leading a team working out of a room deep inside the Dover cliffs that had once contained a generator known as a dynamo (giving the operation its name).

The Luftwaffe’s relentless bombing attacks on the harbor slowed the evacuation process, even as Royal Air Force (RAF) planes tried to delay or stop the German planes from reaching the beaches, losing many aircraft in the process.

DUNKIRK EVACUATION

On the first full day, Operation Dynamo was only able to evacuate about 7,500 men from Dunkirk; around 10,000 got out the following day (May 28).

As Dunkirk had such a shallow beach, Royal Navy vessels couldn’t reach it, and the Allies put out a call for smaller ships to carry troops from the shore to the larger ships further out in the North Sea. Some 800 to 1,200 boats, many of them leisure or fishing crafts, eventually aided in the evacuation from Dunkirk.

Some were requisitioned by the Navy and crewed by naval personnel, while others were manned by their civilian owners and crew. The first members of this small armada—which would become known as the “Little Ships”—began arriving on the beaches of Dunkirk on the morning of May 28, helping to speed up the evacuation.

At the outset, Churchill and the rest of British command expected that the evacuation from Dunkirk could rescue only around 45,000 men at most. But the success of Operation Dynamo exceeded all expectations. On May 29, more than 47,000 British troops were rescued; more than 53,000, including the first French troops, made it out on May 30.

By the time the evacuations ended, some 198,000 British and 140,000 French troops would manage to get off the beaches at Dunkirk—a total of some 338,000 men. An additional 90,000 Allied forces were left behind, along with the bulk of the BEF’s heavy guns and tanks, when the resistance ended on the morning of June 4 and German troops occupied Dunkirk.

LE PARADIS MASSACRE

On May 27, after holding off a German company until their ammunition was spent, 99 soldiers from the Royal Norfolk Regiment retreated to a farmhouse in the village of Paradis, about 50 miles from Dunkirk.

Agreeing to surrender, the trapped regiment started to file out of the farmhouse, waving a white flag tied to a bayonet. They were met by German machine-gun fire.

They tried again and the British regiment was ordered by an English-speaking German officer to an open field where they were searched and divested of everything from gas masks to cigarettes. They were then marched into a pit where machine guns had been placed in fixed positions.

A German officer, Captain Fritz Knochlein, gave the order: “Fire!” Those Brits who survived the machine-gun fire were either stabbed to death with bayonets or shot dead with pistols.

Of the 99 members of the regiment, only two survived, both privates: Albert Pooley and William O’Callaghan. They lay among the dead until dark, then, in the middle of a rainstorm, they crawled to a farmhouse, where their wounds were tended.

With nowhere else to go, they surrendered again to the Germans, who made them POWs. Pooley’s leg was so badly wounded he was repatriated to England in April 1943 in exchange for some wounded German soldiers.

Upon his return to Britain, Pooley’s gruesome story was not believed. Only when O’Callaghan returned home and verified the story was a formal investigation made.

After the war, a British military tribunal in Hamburg found Captain Knochlein, who gave the fateful order to fire, guilty of a war crime. He was hanged for his offense.

IMPACT OF DUNKIRK

While the German blitzkrieg was undoubtedly successful (France would call for an armistice by mid-June 1940), the largely successful evacuation of the bulk of Britain’s trained troops from near-annihilation proved to be a key moment in the Allied war effort.

Germany had hoped defeat at Dunkirk would lead Britain to negotiate a speedy exit from the conflict. Instead, the “Miracle at Dunkirk” became a rallying cry for the duration of the war, and an iconic symbol of the British spirit, leaving a cultural legacy of pride and perseverance that endures nearly eight decades later.

“We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory,” Churchill warned in a speech delivered on June 4, 1940. “Wars are not won by evacuations.”

In the same speech, however, he delivered a stirring statement of the British resolve that would serve the nation well over the next five grueling years of warfare:

“\[We\] shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.”

AFTERMATH OF DUNKIRK

Despite the successful evacuation at Dunkirk, thousands of French troops were left behind and taken prisoner by the advancing Germans. Also abandoned on the shores of Dunkirk were massive supplies of ammunition, machine guns, tanks, motorcycles, jeeps and anti-aircraft artillery.

With Western Europe abandoned by its main defenders, the German army swept through the rest of France, and Paris fell on June 14. Eight days later, Henri Petain signed an armistice with the Nazis at Compiegne.

Germany annexed half of France, leaving the other half in the hands of their puppet French rulers. It wasn’t until June 6, 1944, that the liberation of Western Europe finally began with the successful Allied landing at Normandy.

Elizabeth May's history troubles

Green leader's history references puzzle historians

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May reveals her party’s platform during a campaign stop in Toronto. The preamble has some erroneous historical references (Evan Mitsui/CBC)

Elizabeth May is an expert on climate change and the environment. She has a law degree from Dalhousie University. And for a time, she studied theology at St. Paul's University in Ottawa with an eye to becoming an Anglican priest.

But for all the Green Party leader's interests and talents, it seems that history is not her strong suit.

The Green's electoral platform, released Monday, begins with a personal message from May that casts the fight against human-caused global warming as a daunting, yet winnable struggle — likening it to the Allied efforts to defeat Adolf Hitler and the Nazis in the Second World War.

""Giving up is not an option. Political courage is needed. Incremental actions cannot meet the challenge,"" she writes.

Chooses the Dunkirk story

However, the story that May chooses to illustrate the necessary ""can-do"" spirit — about Winston Churchill and the spring 1940 evacuation of British troops from the beaches of Dunkirk, France — is rife with factual errors, and appears to be more in line with some fictionalized films than the history books.

""The entire British army was pinned down on a beach in northern France, at Dunkirk. France had just surrendered,"" she begins, swinging and missing twice: The British had sent about a third of their army to the continent. And French troops fought bravely to cover their retreat to the Channel beaches, and continued to do so for weeks after the May 27-June 4 evacuations. Their formal surrender didn't come until June 22, 1940.

May then turns her attention to the legendary ""little ships,"" the fleet of 861 civilian fishing boats, pleasure craft and ferries that helped retrieve the trapped soldiers. She writes that it was Winston Churchill's idea to send them, although virtually every historical source credits Admiral Betram Ramsay and his staff for coming up with the plan.

And the Green leader suggests the small boats ""rescued over 300,000 men,"" when the fact is that a British Navy flotilla, including 41 destroyers, 36 minesweepers, and more than 100 other ships carried the bulk of the 338,000 evacuees back to the U.K.

John Broich, a British Empire and World War II historian at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, gives May credit for trying to bring a historical perspective to her politics, but said she appears fuzzy on the details.

""That small ships story feels great, but it's not true,"" he said. ""It was the destroyers that were going back and forth ... And she says that Churchill came up with the plan? Oh my gosh, no, no!""

It's just sort of fake history on a catastrophic level,​​​

\- James Holland, Second World War historian

A Green Party spokesman confirmed that May did write the platform preface herself, and said that her primary source was Five Days in London: May 1940, a 2001 book by the late American historian John Lukacs.

Sounds like Hollywood

Although another expert says he detects some Hollywood influences in May's version of events.

James Holland, an English historian and broadcaster who wrote about the evacuations in his book, The Battle of Britain: Five Months that Changed History, said May's tale appears to be a pastiche of factoids from Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk and Darkest Hour, a 2017 Churchill biopic starring Gary Oldman.

He pointed to a section where the Green leader suggests that the British PM was ""surrounded by military advisers, senior civil servants and Cabinet members demanding that he negotiate terms of surrender with Hitler.""

""That's what happens in Darkest Hour,"" said Holland. ""But that entire film is a crock ....""

Holland said that the discussion of possible peace negotiations — first detailed in Lukac's  book — was mostly confined to the five-man war cabinet, and that the main proponent for the talks, Viscount Halifax, the foreign secretary, ultimately found little support.

Reading the Green leader's platform introduction aloud over the phone from London, Holland became increasingly incensed, calling it ""rubbish"" and ""embarrassing.""

""It's just sort of fake history on a catastrophic level,"" he said. ""Why would you write about this without checking the facts when it's not your core subject?""

May's message concludes with a call on Canadians to tap into ""the spirit of Dunkirk.""

All hands on deck

""We can ask ourselves, 'What can I do with my little boat? Where and how do I pitch in?', she writes. ""As in all efforts to tackle big threats and long odds, we need all hands on deck!""

Case Western's Broich said he doesn't think that the evacuations are really the metaphor that the Green leader thinks they are, given that it was the world's then-most powerful navy that really saved the day.

""I would've thought it'd be far more natural to emphasize how World War II showed the transformative power of government and industry working together to solve a global crisis. Everyone sacrificed a little to gain a lot,"" said Broich. ""Still, I give her marks for effort.""

Perhaps May should have heeded the words of Churchill himself on Dunkirk.

""We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory,"" he told the House of Commons during his famous ""we will fight them on the beaches"" speech on June 4, 1940.  ""Wars are not won by evacuations.""",2019-09-17T12:01:17+00:00
GreenParty,post,Hamas,17gis1i,Alarmed-Direction500,New to the party! I can’t vote for Biden again.,"My entire adult life I’ve registered independent, but always voted Democrat without hesitation. I’m definitely liberal leaning and I think protecting the environment needs to always be a top consideration when any decision is made. I’ve always loved the face value goals of the Green Party, but never fully committed because the presidential races have always felt very “good guy vs bad guy”. 

Hope this isn’t too controversial, but I’m appalled at the way Biden is blindly supporting Israel’s disproportionate and indiscriminate retaliation to Hamas, and by extension the people of Palestine. I cannot vote for Biden in good conscious. 

So, who is the green party’s 2024 presidential nominee?

Yes the duopoly loved presidential campaigns feeling that way because more people will vote for them rather than change. But I do think we're seeing major cracks and ""spoiler"" effect is having less impact on folks now that Biden is making it clear any differences Democrats had from Republicans are quickly disappearing.

>who is the green party’s 2024 presidential nominee?

None yet! The party follows a primary process just like any other party. The first primaries will occur sometime after the beginning of the year. The exact date depends on your state. I'd suggest contacting your state party for more information. See gp.org for more information.

>Is there an accurate and concise source for me to learn about the party’s position

The official party platform is at gp.org/platform which has all of the recent updates approved by the national committee. It's not very concise but it is separated by topics so you can scroll to the topic you want and read.

>What are the party’s general positions on topics like guns, abortions, police reform, lgbt rights, corporate tax reform

Read the platform for details but my summary would be:

Guns -- support basic reforms like background checks but also believe in self defense

Abortion -- unequivocally the party believes it is a right for the mother to choose healthcare including abortion

Police reform -- I believe the platform was updated to support 8 for abolition, the old platform was fairly weak and didn't say much

LGBTQ Rights -- yes full support for LGBTQ including trans rights. The party has a Lavender Caucus which represents LGBTQ members at the national level.

Corporate tax reform -- as part of the Green New Deal, there's a lot of tax changes that would happen but generally corporations pay more and families pay less, including establishing a negative income tax for low wages that would effectively create a universal basic income.

Speaking of, the Green New Deal was originally proposed over a decade ago by the Green Party, the platform was updated last year for a more comprehensive GND plan with a full budget proposal.",2023-10-26T00:42:06+00:00

**Republican lawmakers question 2020 deadline for voting machine replacements**

By Elizabeth Hardison -February 20, 2019
 
Republican members of the Senate Appropriations Committee met on Feb. 20. Democratic Senators were absent due to inclement weather.

A Republican senator said Wednesday that “politically motivated” special interest groups were driving the push to replace Pennsylvania’s voting machines by 2020, even though no evidence suggests that current equipment is vulnerable to hacking.

In an exchange that turned tense at times, Sen. Bob Mensch, R-Montgomery, asked Department of State officials why they are mandating $125 million in technology upgrades on a tight deadline. The matter dominated much of the agency’s annual budget hearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Mensch was taking issue with a 2018 recommendation that Pennsylvania replace its eight-year-old voting machines before the 2020 presidential election. Current machines don’t allow voters to verify their votes after they’re cast.

Pennsylvania is one of 13 states across the country that uses such machines. It was also one of 21 states targeted by international hackers in the 2016 elections, federal officials say.

To date, no evidence suggests that hackers breached Pennsylvania’s voting systems in 2016.

But federal agencies warn that hackers will make new attempts to infiltrate systems during the 2020 election, especially in swing states like Pennsylvania.

Mensch cast doubt on that prediction in the Senate Appropriations hearing Wednesday. He said that Pennsylvania’s current machines aren’t connected to the internet, and therefore couldn’t be hacked online.

Acting Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said that hackers could interfere with elections by changing the cartridges that tabulate votes — a scenario that Mensch called “ludicrous.”

The recommendation that Pennsylvania upgrade its voting machines came in 2018 from the Blue Ribbon Commission on Pennsylvania’s Election Security, which was convened to evaluate voting security practices and advise Pennsylvania lawmakers on how to adopt them.

The working group was a requirement of a settlement that Pennsylvania reached with Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who sued the commonwealth and two other states in 2016 as she sought vote recounts.

After the hearing, Mensch emphasized that Pennsylvania should always strive to improve its election security.

But since the machine upgrades are expected to carry a $125 million price tag, lawmakers must take their time evaluating replacement options, he said. He called the 2020 implementation deadline “arbitrary.”

Mensch said that special interest groups with political motivations are trying to hasten the rollout of new voting equipment. He declined to identify any groups by name.

The members of the Blue Ribbon Commission include foundation presidents, policy experts, and cyber security experts.

During Wednesday’s hearing, state Sen. Mike Folmer, R-Lebanon, said that groups advocating for reforms, such as the Brennan Center for Justice and Common Cause PA, also have lobbying arms.

Boockvar said the Department of State is following the guidance of national security officials and the federal intelligence community, who all agree that the technology Pennsylvania employs is outdated.

“Everybody agrees on one thing: that these systems need to be upgraded to voter-verified paper trails by 2020,” Boockvar said. “If we don’t, we will be the only swing state, if not the only [state] in the country, without a voter verified paper trail. That’s not a position any of us want to be in.”

The cost of voting equipment upgrades will be borne by Pennsylvania’s 67 counties, which administer local, state, and federal elections. The Department of State has $14 million, mostly from federal funds, to reimburse some of those costs. County governments will have to finance the rest.

Boockvar said that some counties have discussed issuing bonds to purchase the new machines. Others could broker financing agreements with vendors, which could carry hefty interest rates.

Mensch warned that lawmakers have rushed through election upgrades once before. They’re now paying the cost, since the machines they purchased eight years ago are already outdated, he said.

“We are in the place where we are today, without paper trails, because we made technical decisions that were not good decisions in retrospect,” Mensch said. “My concern is we have a rush to 2020 [at] a huge expense to taxpayers.”",2019-02-21T12:30:10+00:00

Even with paper ballots, voters sometimes have the option of using a machine to mark the ballot and then there is counting by machine.  And we have the addition problem of discovering cartons of paper ballots stashed somewhere, like the trunk of a car. 

We need very stiff penalties for election fraud, paper ballots, counted IN PUBLIC, by hand with a receipt to be held by the voter until final results are announced. We need an impeccable chain of custody. Podcasts can help with both chain of custody and counting in public. 

Even with all that, fraud is possible.  However, we should at least do all we can, no?",2019-11-24T13:56:03+00:00

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit that prompted Pennsylvania’s mass voting machine upgrade want a federal judge to reopen the case because they say state officials are violating the settlement.

**By Emily Previti**  
**November 26, 2019**

[In a motion filed today](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/jillstein/pages/29211/attachments/original/1574792209/Stein._Notice_of_Motion_to_Enforce_Settlement_Agreement_%2800401098x9CCC2%29.PDF?1574792209) in U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, they ask the court to block the use of an election system that’s being used by 1.2 million voters.

The state has to ensure that every voter in Pa. uses a voter verifiable paper ballot by next year, at the latest, under the terms of a [settlement](https://drive.google.com/drive/search?ths=true&q=stein) agreement to a lawsuit led by 2016 Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. 

When the case first settled one year ago, some [election experts criticized the agreement](https://twitter.com/jennycohn1/status/1068158889135230976) for being too vague. 

They flagged, for example, the settlement’s failure to sufficiently detail what “voter verifiable” means and the possibility that the state would certify systems with barcoded ballots. Barcodes are vulnerable to tampering, and voters can’t determine whether they reflect their ballot choices, experts noted at the time. 

Those issues figure prominently in Tuesday’s filing. 

Stein’s lawyers argue that the state’s certification of the ExpressVote XL violates the settlement because it relies on paper ballot cards that encode voters’ choices in a bar code. 

With the XL, voters enter their choices on a touchscreen. Before casting their ballot, they review those choices printed and displayed through a plastic window beside the screen. 

Stein’s attorneys also argue that some voters have trouble seeing clearly through the plastic sleeve, and that the paper shown to voters — and retained for auditing purposes — isn’t a ballot as defined in Pennsylvania election code. 

Those reasons are just a few cited by fair election and good government groups when they petitioned the Department of State to re-examine the XL over the summer. 

DoS upheld its certification. But both the petitioners and the Stein plaintiffs criticized the department for having the machine re-examined out of state without letting them know.

Meanwhile, [Northampton County voters await an explanation for tabulation errors](https://papost.org/2019/11/06/machine-errors-delay-election-reporting-in-pa-s-northampton-county/) by some ExpressVote XL devices on Election Day Nov. 5.

Philadelphia rolled out the machine [the same day, with comparatively minor complaints](https://papost.org/2019/11/07/philly-officials-praise-new-voting-machines-promise-to-fix-significant-wrinkles-for-2020/) about delays and confusion at the polls. 

Cumberland County used its old system during the municipal election, but plans to debut the XL next spring after resolving concerns that arose earlier [over financing](https://cumberlink.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/election-what-s-the-deal-with-those-voting-machines-in/article_0ab90c47-d0c1-5d47-8f87-9ab8687f7f4f.html). 

About a dozen counties haven’t picked machines yet. 

Among them, only Dauphin County had been considering the XL. Commissioners there, however, balked recently when it was time to enter the next round of contract negotiations, citing [problems experienced with the XL and other systems statewide Nov. 5](https://whyy.org/articles/7-solutions-for-pennsylvanias-problems-at-the-polls/). 

The county budget scheduled for introduction today doesn’t include funding for new voting machines. However, officials expect to meet about the issue in early December with the Department of State, according to commissioners chief of staff Chad Saylor. 

ES&S spokeswoman Katina Granger noted the XL’s gone through “hundreds of thousands of hours of testing” between certification by the federal Election Assistance Commission and at the state level — including in Pa., where it went “through … expensive testing not just once, but twice.”

“By all accounts, it meets and exceeds the highest standards for security, accuracy and accessibility,” Granger wrote in an email.

The state has until Dec. 12 to respond, according to [a court order issued Tuesday](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OK4-knFp_Sc7i5n_1j32qzfdnhL89EUu/view?usp=sharing).

* *MEDIA ALERT: Green Party Candidate Jill Stein at Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia, 10/2, noon*

**PHILADELPHIA** – The Steering Committee of the [**Green Party of Philadelphia**](https://www.gpop.org/news/) (GPOP) has endorsed the Protect Our Vote rally on Wednesday, October 2, and the struggle to ""Stop the Machine."" More information may be found here, [https://www.facebook.com/events/391050428235509/](https://www.facebook.com/events/391050428235509/).

[**Protect Our Vote**](https://www.facebook.com/POVPhilly/) believes that the voting system chosen for three Pennsylvania counties does not meet the standard for election integrity. GPPA Co-Chair [**Sheri Miller**](https://www.gp.org/sheri_miller) said, ""Cumberland, Northampton and Philadelphia Counties have chosen to use the ES&S ExpressVote XL voting system. We demand that this be stopped! We must have secure voting systems with reliable audits if voters are expected to participate and to trust the results of their voting.""

The Stop the Machine rally will take place at noon on October 2 on the steps of the Byrne U.S. Courthouse, 601 Market Street in Old City, Philadelphia. **Jill Stein**, Green Party candidate for President in 2012 and 2016 will be present for the rally. Stein was victorious in the 2018 federal settlement requiring election integrity in all PA counties.

**Richard Garella**, co-founder of Protect Our Vote Philly, said, ""We believe the gold standard for election integrity is: 1) hand-marked paper ballots; 2) the best possible accessibility devices; and 3) mandatory risk-limiting audits after every election. If we don't Stop the Machine, one-sixth of PA voters will be using machines that replicate the problems which the Jill Stein v. Cortez settlement was designed to prevent.

**Emily Cook,** a Green Party member from Montgomery County and a plaintiff in [**Stein v. Cortes**](https://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/litigation/Steinv.Cortes.php), said, ""Cumberland, Northampton and Philadelphia Counties should make haste to acquire better voting systems, as we have done in Montgomery County.""

More than two years after the groundswell demanding recounts in the 2016 election, the fight for election integrity and voting justice is still going strong. To keep you up to date on our work, made possible by the generous support of recount contributors, here are some exciting developments in the continuing struggle on the front lines.

**Pennsylvania headed for 100% paper ballots by 2020!**

Counties across PA are updating their voting systems as required by our legal settlement mandating 100% paper ballots by 2020. The agreement also calls for urgently-needed robust election audits by 2022. Our 2016 Recount team is represented on boards overseeing the implementation of these decisions by renowned expert Dr. J. Alex Halderman, and Mark Lindemann, Senior Science and Technology Policy Officer of Verified Voting.

Grassroots activists are playing a critical role in watchdogging local officials, who choose the new systems. Activists are warning against a “hybrid” ballot marking device that can be hacked to print a ballot that’s different from the vote it records, the ES&S Expressvote XL. Philadelphia city commissioners recently discarded advice from community groups and purchased this system. We must turn up our volume and hold officials accountable! (More on ballot-marking devices below.) [This article](https://www.jill2016.com/r?u=IBj4ulEqC5AntjPK4lMkvajKMhOazgeUfn92dU6evwlcCrLqecGmukkVrmsD1jLKmJ3kjjL-4f7n8RGYYy8BnRKNntZHoqPQZa9BOCIQGGaOykLwl8xlqV89ItHdC6xYOaQQTWApx2V8ycOrdFVThBCh7_kqPvweIT7BgsQze7M8dbMlVOq58m9oTeSPgY05&e=bb51e179c9ca99d42f52f306f4152849fb4bcd3b&utm_source=jillstein&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=vj_update&n=2) has more on upgrading PA’s obsolete systems.  


**Wisconsin recount litigation moves forward - against corporate resistance!**

In WI, we continue to prevail against legal maneuvering by voting machine corporations attempting to block scrutiny of their software. We have also won rulings that block their effort to impose a gag rule that would have prevented us from publicly disclosing what we find in our upcoming software investigation. How can we trust our elections if critical software, controlled by private corporations, is shielded from scrutiny?[ Details on our latest legal battles in WI are here](https://www.votingjustice.us/wi_recount_litigation_moves_forward?e=bb51e179c9ca99d42f52f306f4152849fb4bcd3b&utm_source=jillstein&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=vj_update&n=3).  


**Detroit activists continue the fight for election integrity!**

Before the recount effort in Michigan was shut down by the courts, it was already uncovering major problems, particularly in communities of color like Detroit, where more than 80 ballot scanners broke down on election day, and a whopping 60% of precincts were ruled ineligible for recounting due to problems with the initial count. Now, grassroots activists are working to get Detroit’s new Charter Revision Commission to improve election integrity and oversight of the voting process.  [For details and info on how Detroit residents can get involved, go here.](https://www.jill2016.com/r?u=LHsyN1kS88UXbzFgmrMLXwoUnB6BbtEYsDMDZulEcL7yu2kKfMV50uONGXWZaq6rmcxRNwjnNKlcCg68E6QLqA&e=bb51e179c9ca99d42f52f306f4152849fb4bcd3b&utm_source=jillstein&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=vj_update&n=4)  


**Anti-democratic roadblocks to recounts still in place. Headaches ahead in 2020.**

This [excellent article](https://www.jill2016.com/r?u=7zsaTrYaHbXYUUvtUozf0jB3Kq4JkbjZknR9Rmjbc-uJD5KE8KMM0uBfL3rdTnFcQ2u08dxNqOHQQjoe8oUBYwixNnXVLDbAGDxtBpDfmm60SX4pNXBQQPGUIs55zcZXkq2Xt1hB5hhJTvNR6r7XBA&e=bb51e179c9ca99d42f52f306f4152849fb4bcd3b&utm_source=jillstein&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=vj_update&n=5) by Steven Rosenfeld gives an overview of why the threats to secure, accurate and just elections remain and are likely to produce “recount headaches"" in many 2020 swing states. The anti-democratic roadblocks that prevented meaningful recounts in 2016 remain largely in place, with the exception of PA’s paper ballots required by the recount lawsuit settlement. So the fight for elections we can trust continues!  


**Advocates raise red flags over “Ballot Marking” & “Hybrid” Devices**

The national trend is growing to ban unverifiable “black box” paperless voting machines. However, the same handful of corporations behind those paperless machines are now pushing flawed replacements. There is growing controversy around the spread of “Ballot Marking Devices” (BMDs) that print a “paper ballot” after voters make their choices on a touchscreen or other interface. Of greatest concern are “hybrid” machines that both mark the paper ballots and scan them - potentially without the voter even seeing their paper ballot. This is very troubling as many states and counties are rushing to purchase these machines.

**Ranked Choice Voting in NYC & beyond**

The momentum to bring Ranked Choice Voting to our elections is growing. At recent NYC Charter Commission hearings, advocates showed up in force, calling for RCV for NYC.

RCV opens up choice at a time Americans are hungry for it. RCV lets you rank your choices instead of voting for just one candidate. If your first choice loses, your vote is automatically re-assigned to your second choice. This makes it impossible to “split the vote” or “spoil the election” and ensures the winner has majority support. It brings more voices and viewpoints into our elections, and makes ”lesser evil” voting obsolete.

GreenParty,post,Settlements,dk2yrx,dadoonan,Green Party torches Hillary Clinton for claiming Jill Stein is ‘totally’ a Russian asset,"&#x200B;

“Brazen Orwellian doublespeak” — that’s what the Green Party is saying in response to [Hillary Clinton](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/hillary-clinton/)’s accusation that their 2016 candidate, Dr. [Jill Stein](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/jill-stein/), is “totally” a “Russian asset.”

“Clinton has spent her entire career as an asset of Wall Street, the police state and war — the real dangers to everyday people in the United States and around the world,” Green Party communications manager **Michael O’Neil** said in a statement to *Rolling Stone* on Friday. 

[**Rolling Stone**](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/green-party-hillary-clinton-jill-stein-russian-asset-901008/)  
**By Tessa Stuart**  
**October 16, 2019**

Clinton, the erstwhile Democratic nominee in 2016, sat down for an interview with former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe earlier this week. Over the course of an hour-long discussion, the former Secretary of State speculated that American antagonists would attempt to influence the 2020 election, as they did in 2016. 

She suggested the Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard might be the recipient — witting or not — of help from the Kremlin this time around. (At the Democratic debate on Tuesday, Gabbard called [allegations](https://twitter.com/notcapnamerica/status/1184137347832729606) that her candidacy is being boosted by the Russian government “completely despicable.”) Clinton said she wouldn’t be surprised if Gabbard, failing to secure the Democratic nomination, mounted a third party challenge in 2020.

“I’m not making any predictions, but I think they’ve got their eye on someone who’s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said. “She’s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.” Gabbard responded on Twitter, with her own allegation: that Clinton has been behind a shadow campaign to sabotage her candidacy.

In her conversation with Plouffe, Clinton went on to declare that Stein — her opponent in 2016 — acted as an agent of the Russians. “And that’s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she’s also a Russian asset. Yeah, she’s a Russian asset — I mean, totally.”

Clinton added: “They know they can’t win without a third-party candidate. So I don’t know who it’s going to be, but I will guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most needed.”

O’Neil, speaking on behalf of the [**Green Party**](https://www.gp.org/), rejected Clinton’s logic Friday. “Clinton says ‘they can’t win again without a third party candidate’ when the reality is the Democrats and Republican’s cartel-like suppression of third parties and real democratic reforms like ranked choice voting and proportional representation corroded our politics to the point where a crooked, white supremacist, misogynist, fame-obsessed huckster like Donald Trump could connive his way into the White House.”

He went on to note that many of policies Democrats are debating this year, from the [**Green New Deal**](https://www.gp.org/green_new_deal) to [**Medicare-For-All**](https://www.gp.org/single_payer), were first championed by the Greens, and to highlight Stein’s [ongoing fight](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/jill-stein-philly-voting-machines-2016-recount-settlement-20191002.html) against [**receipt-less voting machines in Pennsylvania**](https://www.gp.org/stein_joins_war_against_new_voting_machines). 

“While Clinton would love to intimidate Green Party candidates and voters with baseless smears, her salty neo-McCarthyism will prove to be rocket fuel for the motivation of Greens everywhere in 2020 and beyond,” O’Neil said.

Clinton’s spokesman, meanwhile, doubled down on the characterization to CNN on Friday.  “If the nesting doll fits, ” Nick Merrill said. “This is not some outlandish claim. This is reality.”",2019-10-19T12:13:29+00:00

[**Private concerns are gutting the Amazon rainforest**](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2019/08/23/amazon-rainforest-six-charts-explain-why-fires-matter/2096257001/), contributing to fires, the loss of plant and animal species, and global warming through the release of carbon as trees are cleared. More than 74,000 fires have burned approximately 7,200 square miles this year in the Brazilian portion of the rainforest.  


""Brazilian politicians are lobbying U.S. businesses like Cargill and Burger King for contracts by promoting the Amazon region for reckless and exploitative ranching, logging and mining operations,"" said **Craig Seeman**, member of the Green Party's [**Animal Rights Committee**](https://gpus.org/committees/animal-rights/). 

""The cattle sector of the Brazilian Amazon, incentivized by the international beef and leather trades, [**has been responsible for about 80% of all deforestation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_of_the_Amazon_rainforest) in the region. The lax enforcement of rules and regulations by leaders in Brazil and the United States have set the tone for widespread pillage of protected areas in both countries.""

Among other things, scientists recommend that we restore ecosystems and stop burning fossil fuels to avoid ""[**irreversible loss in land ecosystem services required for food, health and habitable settlements**](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/30/E6089)."" 

""Greens have been at the forefront in calling for a strong international climate treaty,"" said **Steve Newman**, Secretary of the [**Green Party of Florida**](https://www.gpfl.org/) and a member of the Green Party of the U.S. [**Eco-Action Committee**](https://gpus.org/committees/eco-action/). ""The climate treaty reached in Paris in 2015 is inadequate to address the climate change crisis, and the current impasse at the international level displays a [**dangerous lack of commitment**](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/08/amazon-fires-reveal-dysfunction-global-community/159426/?oref=defenseone_today_nl) toward addressing a climate emergency. The Green Party calls for legally binding commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2020 and a 95% reduction by 2030 over 1990 levels.""

The Green Party further calls for:

* the elimination of subsidies for fossil fuels, nuclear power, biomass and waste incineration and biofuels;  

* acknowledge that the bulk of the U.S. military budget is an indirect subsidy for oil & gas corporations, and redirect that spending into sustainable energy production regenerative agriculture and ""green jobs"";  

* work to provide a carbon neutral development path for developing countries to help them avoid burning cheap fossil fuels;  

* a move to convert our food production to small-scale organic, regenerative agriculture (agroecology) systems to restore soil health, sequester carbon, foster biodiversity, discourage the currently unsustainable level of meat consumption, and secure robust ecosystem services for a sustainable future;  

* acknowledgement and support the role of indigenous people and other local Brazilian activists who are fighting to save the rainforest. According to [**Amazon Watch's Moira Birss**](http://accuracy.org/release/amazon-global-emergency): ""Indigenous people of the Amazon have been sounding the alarm about risks to the rainforest for years and resisting the destruction — sometimes at the cost of their own lives. Now that the world is finally paying attention, it's important to also understand that governments and companies around the world are emboldening Bolsonaro's toxic policies when they enter trade agreements with his government or invest in agribusiness companies operating in the Amazon.""

**April 30, 2019** – Shortly after 7:30 EDT this morning the [**Associated Press reported**](https://www.apnews.com/0153cace08c84c8fbf34f9c6a7bdd4dd) that  Juan Guaido, the self-proclaimed President and defender of democracy in Venezuela, launched a military coup. 

The report from AP went on to say ""Venezuelan Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez said on Twitter that Nicolas Maduro’s government is confronting a small “coup attempt” led by military “traitors” backed by right-wing opponents.""

Details are extremely scarce.

On high alert in Washington, D.C. are the [**Embassy Protection Collective**](https://www.facebook.com/ColectivosporlaPaz/). In early April, with permission of the Venezuelan Government, a number of local residents moved into the Venezuelan Embassy to prevent occupation by Guaido supporters.

Shortly after the military coup began in Caracas, the Embassy Protection Collective posted the following on Social Media.

*""We are on alert and urging people to join us. There has been an increase in  undercovers around the embassy.*

*""No matter how coup turns out we are at greater risk. It looks like it is failing in Caracas but to early to be definitive. If it fails they mat want a victory by taking this embassy.*

*""We expect opposition protesters today and tomorrow.""*

Among those protecting the Venezuelan Embassy are Green Party members [Kevin Zeese](https://www.gp.org/kevin_zeese) and [Margaret Flowers](https://www.gp.org/dr_margaret_flowers).

No one, Indian or non-Indian, will survive.—Rennard Strickland (Osage/Cherokee), Distinguished Professor Emeritus, University of Oregon School of Law 

Until the most recent blink of human time, Indian tribes exercised territorial sovereignty over nearly all of the land on this continent—two billion acres. Nature was abundant and, for the most part, in a state of remarkable balance. Most tribes affirmatively managed resources to maintain a sustainable existence...Native peoples' understanding of their traditional role as stewards of the land—a gift from the Creator—was that the Earth should be protected in perpetuity for the sake of future generations.

The occupation of indigenous America reduced tribal lands to four per-cent of aboriginal territory, and tribal jurisdiction receded along with the retreating boundaries. Authority over Nature's Trust—the land and resources on this continent—accordingly became vested in a new set of trustees: federal and state governments. These new sovereigns had little or no experience managing natural resources. The premise of their management philosophy has been exploitation rather than conservation, and they accordingly opened Native territorial lands to consumption by private interests. A philosophy more diametrically opposed to Native peoples' stewardship can hardly be imagined."" —Wood, Mary C. and Welcker, Zach, ""Tribes as Trustees Again (Part I): The Emerging Tribal Role in the Conservation Trust Movement"" (2008).

[**The Green Party**](https://www.gp.org/) strongly opposes the U.S. administration's support of an attempted military coup in Venezuela. According to the Associated Press, opposition leader and self-proclaimed President Juan Guaido launched a military coup attempt against the Nicolas Maduro government about 7:30 am (EDT) this morning. While details are scarce, the action appears to have only limited military support.

The Green Party joins with the United Nations in recognition of **Nicolás Maduro** as the legitimate president of Venezuela.

The Green Party platform suppprts states that ""the U.S. must recognize the sovereignty of nation-states and their right of self-determination."" The Green Party has called for a policy of non-intervention and for sanctions against Venezuela to be lifted. 

The Green Party opposes the ongoing U.S. foreign policy of ""regime change"" that has been a characteristic of both Republican and Democratic administrations.

A new report shows that as many as 40,000 civilians have died in Venezuela since 2017 as a result of the sanctions.

On high alert in Washington, D.C. are the **Embassy Protection Collective**. In early April, with permission of the Venezuelan Government, a number of local residents moved into the Venezuelan Embassy to prevent occupation by Guaido supporters.  


It would be illegal under international law for the U.S. to facilitate control of the embassy to opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has asserted a claim to the office.   


Shortly after the military coup began in Caracas, the Embassy Protection Collective posted the following on Social Media:

*""We are on alert and urging people to join us. There has been an increase in undercovers around the embassy.*  


*""No matter how coup turns out we are at greater risk. It looks like it is failing in Caracas but to early to be definitive. If it fails they may want a victory by taking this embassy.*

* *The world has gotten a look into the abyss, and doesn’t like what it saw staring back*

**BOYNTON BEACH, FL** – As Iran’s General Qassem Suleimani was arriving on a mission of peace — having been invited to Iraq to help mediate relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia — he was brutally ambushed by an American drone on his way from the Baghdad Airport.  A leader of Iraq’s own anti-ISIS militias was killed in the same blast.

The Trump administration’s flurry of lies was so brazen as to be a deliberate challenge to the world.  “We done it and we’re glad.  Whatcha gonna do about it?”  The U.S. threatened Iran with nuclear devastation if Iran struck back.  People around the world were glued to their TV sets as the official commentators droned on.  World War III breaking out was a real possibility.  Even if Iran were “turned into a parking lot,” Iran made clear that it would go down shooting and an increasingly fragile imperial economy would go down with it.

### The world pushed back

Congress complained that — as much as Suleimani deserved to die for all the American blood he allegedly had on his hands — they should have been invited to the party first.  But Europe refused to praise Trump for murdering a foreign leader, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was “disappointed.”  The Iraqi government promptly demanded that the U.S. remove all its forces from the country, and the U.S. is now saying “Hell no, we won’t go!”

Most importantly, the American people — once again characterized as slack-jawed yahoos who would rally around their president in a frenzy of patriotic fervor — did not play their assigned role.  According to [an](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-dont-know-what-to-think-about-trumps-iran-strategy/)[ABC/Ipsos](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/majority-americans-disapprove-trumps-handling-iran-feel-safe/story?id=68219819) poll 56% of Americans disapproved of Trump’s handling of the assassination while 43% approved, and 52% thought that killing Suleimani made the U.S. less safe, as opposed to 25% thinking they were more safe.  Even 52% of Republicans are concerned about the possibility of entering into another war in the Middle East.

The Iranians did shoot back, hitting two U.S. bases in Iraq with missiles.  Despite Trump having threatened to hit 52 Iranian targets if Iran lifted a finger, the U.S. held its fire and settled for hitting the Iranians with some more sanctions.

The media are now working to re-frame the entire affair as some elaborate kabuki dance, nothing to see here, kid, move along.  Indeed, the American people did not fill the streets in protest.  The Europeans are shaken but not stirred.  Israel is remarkably quiet (Iran had announced that the Israeli city of Haifa was in its cross-hairs).  Everyone pretends that things have returned to normal.  But everyone knows this is only the calm before the next storm.

Underneath all the choreography, the world is undergoing a significant tectonic shift.  Yes, centrifugal forces towards breaking free from U.S. hegemony have been in irrevocable motion for some time, but this latest quake did much more than just rattle the china cabinet.

Trump has ripped the bloody mask away from not only himself, but from the whole New World Order as well.  The U.S. is forced to rule by naked power alone.  As they say, Rome wasn’t destroyed in a day, but ruling by naked power alone without the veneer of legitimacy is the beginning of the end of the Empire, when in the words of Roger Waters, we have “wrested technology’s sword from the hand of the war lords.”

### The Green Party stands with the people of the Middle EastSpeaking for the Green Party of Florida (GPFL), party Co-Chair Robin Harris says:

“We strongly condemn the assassination of General Suleimani by the United States.  It was outright murder.  Trump’s claim that this attack was done to protect American lives is a heinous lie!  Its only purpose was to shore up the oligarchs and imperialists.

“As a Black woman who observes daily genocide and the militant occupation of our neighborhoods, I stand in solidarity with the people of Iran and Iraq.  We applaud the efforts of Black Alliance for Peace, Code Pink, and every other organization fighting for peace and justice.  Finally, we demand the withdrawal of troops in all countries that the United States has an illegal presence in.”

#### LeBeau Kpadenou, GPFL Co-Chair, adds:

“We reject attempts to lay all this at the feet of Donald Trump, or at the feet of the Republican Party alone.  Not when the supposedly peace-loving Democrats fully backed increasing last year’s U.S. military budget by $22 billion more than had been asked for

“This only emphasizes the need for an independent socialist party.  We are the party that calls on the U.S. to withdraw from the Middle East.  We are the party that demands respect for the sovereignty and self-determination of all nations.

“And we join with all the people of the world in saying, let there be peace upon this earth.”

GreenParty,post,Occupation,4rfms9,BallzSpartan,Moving to a third party,"I am in a not so unique position of being unable to stomach voting for either of the two primary parties candidates. I have decided to vote for either Dr. Stein or Gov. Johnson. I know these two candidates have very different platforms so I am trying to decide which candidate is best for me. I hope you will be willing to show me why I should vote for your candidate over the other. Using, ontheissues.org, I notated what I like about each candidate. I hope this isn't being too demanding, please feel free to ignore if this has been posted too frequently. 

Abortion: While I am personally against abortion, I believe people should have the right to chose. I like Gov. Johnson's policy of right to choose up until the viability of the fetus. I like Dr. Stein's policy of birth control under healthcare and funded stem cell research. 

Economy: We are seriously underwater on our debt and we need to begin reducing debt but that is going to be difficult without an economy that is improving for the everyman and tax loopholes abound. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to immediately move to a balanced budget, cut defense spending and end bailouts of large corporations. I like that Dr. Stein wants to cut defense spending, tax bailout bonuses and move social healthcare spending to preventive care.

Civil Rights: I believe people should act as they feel, it isn't my place to tell someone else what they can do in their home with other consenting individuals. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to wants to get government out of the marriage business and legalizing prostitution. I like that Dr. Stein is for gay rights and pay equity.

Corporations: This is challenging, I know they have their place but they are buying too much favoritism. I think Gov. Johnson is right that we need to end corporate tax. I agree with Dr. Stein that the wealthy are paying far too little in taxes after all of the loopholes. 

Crime: Currently, far too many people are going to prison unnecessarily and that is creating a business. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to reduce the number of jailable offenses. I think Dr. Stein is right that minorities go to jail more frequently for the same offenses that white people often don't and that prison has become a business that is perverting the judicial system. 

Drugs: I feel drugs need to be decriminalized, punishment is not prevention. I like Dr. Stein's approach to put drug users into rehab but I worry it will become a money making scheme. 

Education: There are huge problems with our education system, it is primed to fail spectacularly. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to abolish student loans, I feel that moving all student loan funding to work study programs would be enormously beneficial. I like that Dr. Stein wants to make all public education free.

Energy: We need to move to renewable energy, solar energy is practically free and could power a huge portion of our grid if we could just the red tape out of the way. I like that Gov. Johnson is in favor of nuclear energy and dropping cap and trade. I like that Dr. Stein is aggressive on renewable energy and fracking. 

Environment: Change needs to happen immediately in order to protect the planet, we need to limit the negative impact we have. I like that Gov. Johnson is willing to be aggressive with air quality and preservation of endangered species. I like that Dr. Stein is aggressive on environmental controls but I dislike her policy on GMO's. 

Family: Both candidates are great here. 

Foreign Policy: I think the US currently meddles too much, aid should be aid because it is necessary, not because it furthers some agenda with a foreign dignitary. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to pull back on foreign aid and wants to fully open trade with Cuba. I like that Dr. Stein wants to trade with Cuba and end US blessing of Israeli occupation. 

Free Trade: I think free trade has its place but that it is currently being used as a bulldozer instead of a chisel. I'm not a fan of Gov. Johnson's support of NAFTA. I like that Dr. Stein is opposed to TPP. 

Government Reform: Big monied interest are making a democracy that no longer works for the everyman. I like that Gov. Johnson ran a self funded Governor campaign but worry about the extensiveness of his veto record. I like that Dr. Stein supports a voter bill of rights and doesn't take large money donations. 

Gun Control: I feel that I am with the majority of gun owners when I say some common sense gun control is what we want. I would like to see a mandatory gun safety class taught nationwide. I'm not a particularly fond of either candidates stance on this issue. 

Healthcare: I want to see a Government system that leverages the buying power of the entire US while allows people to continue to use private practice if they so choose. I look to South Korea as an example. I agree with Gov. Johnson that Obamacare simply isn't working. I agree with Dr. Stein that medicare for all leverages the weight of the American people to provide best cost per person.

Immigration: I think illegal immigration will continue as long as there is great disparity in quality of life. I agree with Gov. Johnson that we need to provide citizenship to make illegal immigrants into tax payers. I like that Dr. Stein wants to provide a path to citizenship. 

Homeland Security: I strongly dislike the Patriot Act and spying on citizens without just cause. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to end spying on citizens and believes it to be a violation of the 4th amendment. I like that Dr. Stein wants to provide whistleblower protections and start returning bases to their home country.

Jobs: I don't believe there is a silver bullet here but I tend to fall on the square deal side of the line. Work hard and you deserve to make a living wage in safe conditions. I agree with Gov. Johnson that companies create jobs but I worry that pigeonholes him into the private sector. I like that Dr. Stein wants to create green jobs, I worry that we end up with another overly bloated ""stimulus package"".

Social Security: I think we need to raise the age for social security and tie the age to a nonbiased age metric. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to raise the age but the only privatization I agree with is investing the principal in safe diversified holdings. I like that Dr. Stein errs on the side of no privatization.  

Taxes: Our current system is ripe with loopholes, avoidance schemes and income laundering. If possible, simplifying taxes to ensure everyone pays what they owe would be ideal. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to revolutionize and simplify our tax code. I like that Dr. Stein wants to implement growth from the bottom by cutting taxes from the bottom up. 

I like both candidates approach to technology.

War: I feel the US is currently too militaristically involved across the globe. It is expensive and creating as many enemies as it is defeating and the only way to properly do nation building is South Korea where it took 40 years and a lot of money. If we can't commit to that then we shouldn't tear the place down. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to cut money and influence to Israel and that the way we are currently doing nation building isn't working. I like that Dr. Stein wants to keep us out of conflicts as much as possible. 

If you've made it to here I want to thank you for taking the time to read my viewpoints and respond. I'm sure we will disagree on somethings and that is ok. I prefer to have my positions challenged so that I can see what I truly stand firm on and what is something I'm acting out based on emotion or misinformation. Thank you, I look forward to your comments. ",2016-07-05T23:47:36+00:00
GreenParty,comment,Occupation,d50u66t,jetsjets369,,"For me, the issues above all other issues are campaign finance and media coverage.

Campaign finance is obvious. To address the other issues (healthcare, college affordability, moving to a renewable energy source, etc), we need representatives who work for the people. The current representatives largely work for rich billionaires, meaning that they're less incentivized to address the issues that matter to the constituency. If we don't address the issue of campaign finance, even our net neutrality could be at risk.

Media coverage is a product of the failing campaign finance system. The corporations that bribe political candidates also own media networks. Wonder why CNN is covering Hillary R. Clinton so much? Of course, Time Warner owns CNN and funds Hillary Clinton. This is the crux of why I believe that Jill E. Stein is a better candidate than Gary E. Johnson. The rich capitalist industrialists are more willing to broadcast Johnson, who protects their interests, than Stein, who protects your interests.

Having the workers own their own businesses means that more of the profit goes to those who do the work, not just those who buy business after business and live off of whatever salary they draw. It's essentially rent seeking and it has no place in a well functioning economy.

Essentially, giving tax incentives to co-ops would give money to small businesses for them to grow, it just happens to be that these small businesses would be worker owned and operated. They could grow, surely, but that characteristic would remain. 

Having corporate co-ops would be the best of both worlds for you, I'd imagine (Mondragon is the favorite to point to). We could reduce taxes on businesses so as to make them more competitive on a global scale, but ensure that the people who work there are getting a fair share of the profits and a voice in the workplace. 

The Green New Deal is, at this point, essential to combat climate change and provide jobs. The unemployment rate we should be looking at is, IIRC, the U-6 rate, which includes those who have dropped out of the workforce altogether, those working part time, and those who are underpaid. That's still around 10% which means that our economy is not functioning anywhere near full capacity, which means that productivity is hurting for it. By employing people in green jobs, we can combat climate change, push alternative energy globally (by making the equipment cheaper through US manufacturing), give back some dignity to the American working class, and pull capitalism just enough from the brink of collapse to transition slowly toward a better society.

Having the opportunity to share my concerns, and hear yours, on this scale has been an unbelievably humbling experience. Across the thousands of conversations I’ve had with neighbors and constituents, one thing is clear: people want a Representative who is a passionate, caring advocate for New London. Although I decided to run as a third party candidate because I believe New London can do better than it has been doing, I have high hopes about New London and Southeastern Connecticut’s future.  
>  
>Regardless of the outcome tonight, I won’t stop fighting for what I believe in. I think we’re looking to pay off our deficit in the wrong ways, and it’s not a good long-term solution. We need to prioritize the working-class in New London by ensuring they are not being taxed disproportionately. Similarly, we need to make sure the wealthiest among us are paying their fair share, but we need to be cognizant of the best way to go about this to make sure there is equity among all socioeconomic classes so we cater towards both business development and a high standard of living. Just as we need to work towards balancing the budget and make strides towards being a more stable state, we also need to invest in our future. When we discuss things like infrastructure, healthcare, and increased minimum wages, these are not only issues that affect us today, but these are issues that will affect us tomorrow. These are investments in our future and future generations; these are ways to attract graduates, businesses, and investment.  
>  
>I encourage everyone to never stop fighting for what they believe in. As your Representative, I would take policy to Hartford that advocates for us today and ensures our stability tomorrow, but even if we don’t get the outcome we want tonight, I’ll still fight for that policy where I can. Our next Representative will be pivotal in New London’s future, and it’s our responsibility to hold them—whoever they may be—accountable. We should encourage them to not only continue with the upward trajectory of the state pier, but also advocate for alternative energy industries to invest in the rare opportunity that exists therein. We should encourage them to not only continue with proposed legislation to bring down the deficit, but also advocate for ways to change the system that allowed it to happen in the first place. Be it attending two debates or knocking on doors, the power of the constituency could not be clearer to me. A Representative should represent the will of *all* their constituents, and it’s our responsibility to ensure they do.  
>  
>To my supporters: I cannot thank you enough. To support an atypical campaign takes courage, and there was no shortcoming of that in the past two months. The unprecedented support for a campaign like this speaks volumes about the change people desire, and I’m honored that so many have put faith in me to at least attempt to work towards that change. Elected or not, know that my passion for advocacy and love for New London will remain unaffected. A better, more equitable future is a vision we can all get behind, and I have no plans on stopping working towards that reality when I wake up tomorrow morning.  
>  
>To everyone who voted: thank you. An election like this is just as important as any other. The election will be defined by its low voter turnout, so take pride in the fact that you defied the odds. Having voted today means you believe in a different, better vision for New London, and regardless of the candidate you chose to back, this is a testament to the amount that you care for New London. As I emphasized earlier, don’t let the results deter you. Never stop voting, never stop fighting, and never stop talking.   
>  
>I love New London and I love its people. I hope to celebrate good news tonight, but I will celebrate a contentious election no matter the result. I cannot thank you all enough for giving myself and others the platform to share their visions for how to move forward as a community, and I am so thankful for the feedback and discussion that resulted from this opportunity. Wishing everyone the best.

The United States takes pride in calling itself a ""democratic"" republic, with ""free and fair elections."" Yet Illinois election laws are fixed to give a huge advantage to the candidates of just two political parties, stifling all other competition. Such a system cannot justly be described as ""democratic"" or ""free and fair."" That is why the Illinois Green Party urges Illinoisans to speak up and take a [**strong stand in support of Senate Bill 141**](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=141&GAID=15&DocTypeID=SB&LegId=115274&SessionID=108&GA=101).

Illinois has one of the most repressive, restrictive and grossly unfair ballot access laws in the United States. For example:

* When a Democratic or Republican (established party) candidate wants to get on the ballot for statewide office (president, governor, senator, etc.), that candidate must gather 5,000 petition signatures from registered voters. A Green, Libertarian, or other minority party candidate must gather five times as many – 25,000 signatures.  

* Similarly, when an established party candidate wants to get on the ballot for State Senate, they are required to gather 1,000 petition signatures from voters in their district. For State Representative, the number is just 500 signatures. A candidate of any other political party must gather a number equal to at least 5% of the total number of persons who voted in the district in the last election. In 2018, depending on the district, that number was between 1,711 and 5,756 signatures for State Senate, and between 1,330 and 3,103 signatures for State Rep.  

* The law is more complex for congressional candidates but the disparity between established party and other candidates is even more extreme. Taking the First Congressional District as a typical example: A Democrat running for Congress in 2018 had to collect 1,230 signatures, a Republican had to collect 408 signatures – but a candidate of any other party had to collect at least 16,640 signatures.  

* Established party candidates gather their petition signatures in the Fall preceding the March Primary election. Other candidates cannot even begin gathering the required signatures until late March – after the Primary. In both cases, the candidate has just 90 days to gather signatures. That restriction is ridiculous in both instances, but it accentuates the advantage of the established party candidates, who already enjoy the advantage of greater institutional and monetary support. For other candidates, the barrier is near-impossible, requiring a huge commitment of volunteer time and/or money – just to get on the ballot.  

* After filing their signatures, minority party candidates frequently must defend their petitions against legal challenges filed by an objector from one of the established parties. This again consumes time, money and many volunteer hours. Typically, the candidates won't even know whether their name will appear on the ballot until late Summer. Meanwhile, established party candidates can devote their time, money and volunteer support to actual campaigning, with a head start of several months.

During the objection process, election authorities frequently discount large numbers of petition signatures gathered by minority party candidates on dubious or highly technical grounds. As a result, minority party candidates must plan on gathering about 50 percent more signatures than the minimum required in order to ensure that they survive the challenge.

Polls consistently show that a [**majority of Americans support**](https://news.gallup.com/poll/244094/majority-say-third-party-needed.aspx) having third (or fourth) party choices on the ballot. Yet their desires are frustrated by unfair ballot access laws like those in Illinois.

The excuse given by the established parties to justify these laws is that they are needed to avoid having ""too many"" parties or candidates on the ballot. In court, they have defended these laws as necessary to avoid ""ballot clutter"" and ""voter confusion"" (yes, they have actually used those terms!) – as if voters would get hopelessly ""confused"" having to choose between more than two options. This argument is not only contrary to the public interest, it is an insult to Illinois voters.

Far from avoiding ""ballot clutter,"" the actual result of these laws is to have extremely uncompetitive elections, with many incumbents not even having to face any challenge at all. For example, out of Illinois' 118 State Representative races in 2018:

* There were 53 districts in which only one party had a candidate in the Primary Election. As a result, in the November General Election, there was only one candidate on the ballot in those 53 districts – 45 percent of the total!  

* In 87 State Rep districts, the Democratic candidate in the Primary ran unopposed. In 57 districts, the Republican Primary candidate ran unopposed.  

* There was not a single third-party or independent candidate on the ballot in any State Representative District. This was not for lack of trying. There was only one third-party candidate for State Senate. Only three independent candidates and one Green Party candidate (who had major-party status from prior elections) were on the ballot for Congress.

Senate Bill 141 will take a giant step toward solving this problem and making Illinois' ballot laws fairer -- simply by making the petition signature requirements equal for all political parties. This is not a complete solution. Democratic and Republican candidates will still have the advantage of being able to petition sooner and securing their ballot position sooner. However, making the petition signature requirement equal is the single most important step that could be taken to create a more equitable and democratic system in Illinois.

**Here's what you can do to help get SB 141 passed:**

1. Contact the offices of the co-sponsors – [Sen. Andy Manar](http://www.ilga.gov/senate/Senator.asp?MemberID=2617) and [Sen. Jason A. Barickman](http://www.ilga.gov/senate/senator.asp?GA=101&MemberID=2608) – and thank them for sponsoring the bill and let them know you want to see it passed.  

2. Contact the members of the [Senate Executive Committee](http://www.ilga.gov/senate/committees/members.asp?GA=101&committeeID=2320), and especially the [sub-committee on election law](http://www.ilga.gov/senate/committees/members.asp?committeeID=2558) – and let them know of your support and that you would appreciate their ""yes"" vote on SB 141 to get it on the Senate floor. You can use the points made here as talking points.  

3. [Contact your own State Senator](http://www.ilga.gov/senate/) and ask him/her to support SB 141 and consider joining on as co-sponsors. (If you are not sure who your current Senator is, you can check your voter registration card for the district number, or look it up by checking [your registration status here](https://ova.elections.il.gov/RegistrationLookup.aspx).)

GreenParty,post,Two-state solution,d3pyqj,dadoonan,Opinion: Introducing the Maryland Green New Deal,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rgm8m4mwedm31.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6a3f9bad8c1abc07601ded67318489d5e881e16

[**Maryland Matters**](https://www.marylandmatters.org/2019/09/13/opinion-introducing-the-maryland-green-new-deal/)  
**By Owen Silverman Andrew**  
**September 13, 2019**

Over the last decade, Maryland's political establishment repeatedly expanded corporate gambling in our state, promising the tax proceeds would swell funding for public education. In fact, the reverse happened, and the new tax revenue was used to offset steep cuts to K-12 education from the general fund budget.

A similar proposal was floated recently regarding taxing the fossil fuel industry, which could create a perverse incentive to maintain or even expand an industry wreaking havoc on our climate at a time when we must place a definitive sunset date on using dangerous energy sources altogether. While market-based proposals like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade might be an intermediate step in Maryland's green transition, these policies have been shown to be insufficient to the scale of the crisis we face; now is not a time for professional environmental incrementalism.

&#x200B;

Instead of an isolated policy taxing major carbon emitters like the fossil fuel industry, which threaten the very livability of our communities, we must implement a [**Maryland Green New Deal**](http://www.mdgreens.org/gnd) (MDGND) based on four guiding values: 100% renewable energy by 2032, an end to corporate influence over our environmental policies, a curtailment of the U.S. military's enormous carbon footprint in our state, and a just transition for working class folks, people of color, and other marginalized communities.

Instead of merely repackaging the status quo, the MDGND will begin to take us off a collision course with climate disaster and put us on track to leave Maryland to future generations in better shape than we inherited it.

The first essential principle of the Maryland Green New Deal is a commitment to 100% renewable energy by 2032. The science is clear that kicking the can down the road is a collective death sentence, so we cannot afford to wait on the implementation of half solutions to play out. This commitment to clean energy must be accompanied by reparations to those most negatively affected by climate change caused by environmental racism and oppression, communities like Baltimore, Brandywine, and Cove Point.

To ensure the success of this transition, and to fund it, Maryland must make it clear to fossil fuel polluters that it will use eminent domain to protect the public interest to acquire and sell off all non-carbon intensive industry assets that have not been converted to clean energy by 2032. We owe nothing less to our children and grandchildren's generations.

The second principle of the MDGND, without which all other components face longer odds, is to remove the undue influence of corporate climate deniers and destroyers on Maryland's democracy.

During the 2018 elections, the fossil fuel and other major carbon emitting industries poured big money into the campaigns of Republicans and Democrats alike. While the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling may prohibit an outright ban on these contributions on the state level, Maryland can enact a warning on all campaign literature funded in part by the fossil fuel industry, similar to those found on cigarettes. We must also create more robust public financing programs for all elections, ban former elected officials from professional lobbying, and end the structure of pay to play that made ""Healthy Holly"" possible in order to awaken our democracy.

The third principle of the MDGND would convert our state's sprawling weapons industry into green spaces and green jobs. Doing so will protect public health in two areas: reducing Per and Poly Fluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) contamination of our precious water resources and reducing dangerous contamination associated with firing ranges and weapons testing sites.

Recognizing the vacuum at the federal level, Maryland must establish maximum contaminant levels for PFAS in drinking water, groundwater, surface water, and sewer sludge. These levels must follow the lead of legislatures in California, New Jersey and Vermont with stringent guidelines. Ending tax breaks for corporate weapons dealers will provide another funding stream for the MDGND.

Finally, the MDGND will ensure a just transition to a green future by restoring communities harmed by the state and fossil fuel industries. It will do so both by additional direct investment in targeted communities as well as by employing workers to build the clean energy future as staff of a newly formed Maryland Environmental Neighborhood Defense (MEND) Corps.

Reparations mean repaying communities for harm caused by the state and providing the autonomy for these communities to build the just, green future they choose. Specifically, the MEND Corps would remediate all lead paint in homes in Baltimore's Black Butterfly neighborhoods and beyond, as well as remediating brownfield sites across the state while incubating democratically-owned green businesses.

True bottom-up climate resilience mobilizes everyone, from transitioning carbon intensive industry jobs to the green economy, to rapidly increasing the size of the green jobs sector, to instituting neighborhood-based disaster preparedness and inclusive participatory policy creation.

The MDGND would implement 100% renewable energy by 2032, awaken our democracy by reducing the influence of climate deniers and destroyers, move Maryland's war economy toward a green economy, and ensure a just transition to a green future for people of color, working class people, and other marginalized communities. We need to fund equity in Maryland— including in public education pre-K through graduate school — by holding climate deniers and destroyers accountable for the damage they have done, not simply by taxing their unabated growth.

In short, we need a Maryland Green New Deal, not another casino bait and switch. We invite Marylanders across the state to the table to plan our green future together, guided by the four principles outlined above, and in ways that best meet the needs of your local communities.

PROSPECTS FOR SOCIALISM are off in the future. The 2020 presidential election is here and now, and confronts us with a right-wing menace unlike any that has been faced before.

When asked what our goals are in the 2020 elections the majority of left activists in the USA will say: “to defeat Donald Trump.” Many are even more specific: “We are Bernie or Bust.”

If we are honest with ourselves, however, we must acknowledge that many of these will also end up urging people to vote for the eventual Democratic nominee. We would like to suggest an alternative: Support the positive choice of the [**Green Party**](https://www.gp.org/) candidate for president in 2020.

### How We Got Here

In almost every election cycle, going back to 1960 at least, it would have been reasonable to say (and many did): “Prospects for socialism are off in the future. The presidential election is here and now, and confronts us with a right-wing menace unlike any that has been faced before.” Because this is the entire analysis that most on the left have offered during these decades we are where we are today, trapped in a cycle of settling for the “lesser evil.”

There have been relatively small and mostly sporadic left electoral alternatives. The [**Peace and Freedom Party**](http://www.peaceandfreedom.org/home/about-us/about-peace-and-freedom), one consistent effort, first fielded a presidential candidate in 1968. Its largest vote on the national level (almost 740,000) was achieved when Ralph Nader ran for President in 2008 — the only year PFP tallied more than 100,000 nationwide. But the party was never a meaningful presence outside California.

There have also been formations like [**Raza Unida**](https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utlac/00102/lac-00102.html), the [**Black Panther Party**](https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/workers/black-panthers/), the [**National Black Independent Political Party**](https://blackamericaweb.com/2015/11/24/little-known-black-history-fact-national-black-independent-political-party/), [**Labor Party Advocates**](https://nader.org/1994/08/05/labor-party-advocates/), and others. Each had a relatively brief lifespan, however, and aside from the Panthers, mobilized only a small fraction of the constituency it was hoping to rally.

Small left parties — such as [**Workers World**](https://workersworld-party.org/), the [**Socialist Workers Party**](https://themilitant.com/about/), or the [**Socialist Party**](https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/eam/spa/socialistparty.html) — reached even smaller audiences with their campaigns. And most of the left has, for all these decades, focused its attention on the Democratic Party, or else just stood aside from electoral politics.

Let’s consider some of the reasons why. Integrated links exist between the labor bureaucracy and the Democratic Party machine. This deeply affects the outlook of the entire labor movement. Also, imperialism abroad grants the organized section of U.S. labor (and others) privileges in relation to the world working class, leading to support for — or at least acquiescence in — U.S. foreign policy by many.

In recent years currents have arisen (among nurses and teachers most clearly) which begin to understand that the interests of organized labor can be effectively defended only when the interests of the entire class are defended as well. So far, however, this has not extended to a generalized independent participation in the electoral arena.

The Democratic Party also has a hold on the Black community. Articles in [**Black Agenda Report**](https://www.blackagendareport.com/) and talks by [**Glenn Ford**](https://twitter.com/glenfordbar) help us understand why. Ford points out that the two-party system traps Blacks into voting for the lesser evil against the overtly white-supremacist Republicans.

The belief that this is some kind of protection has been disproved, however, by poverty, poor schools and housing, police brutality and killings even in cities where the Democrats rule. And while the DP allows Black electoral representation, it expects those who win office under its banner to promote a ruling-class agenda over the needs of the Black community. Similar analyses are needed about Latinx and Puerto Rican communities (although this is beyond what we can offer in this article).

### The “Spoiler” Argument

When workers, Blacks, Latinxs, and others have no alternative except to vote for the Democrats their votes can be taken for granted. The political rhetoric and policies of the DP become free to shift consistently rightward in an effort to capture votes from others. The Republicans shift rightward too.

The **Bernie Sanders**/**Ocasio-Cortez** phenomenon represents a momentary counter-current. How much staying power will it have? How much can it achieve? These things are unknown. Both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have already limited themselves in ways that ought to raise warning flags for their supporters. They have to limit themselves if their goal is to remain in and influence the Democratic Party.

Allowing electoral politics to be monopolized by parties which represent the interests of the rich and powerful is a serious default on the part of the U.S. left. The result has been that political protest movements consistently invest significant energy in pursuit of electoral solutions which, in the final analysis, reach a complete dead end.

Another factor that causes electoral politics to remain the same is, of course, the winner-take-all two-party system itself. As with the Black community, this consistently puts left and progressive movements in a position of supporting what they consider the “lesser evil.” Alternative candidates are pejoratively characterized as “spoilers.”

Instead of pointing to Democratic voters who switched to Trump, or the pathetic record of the Democratic Party on social justice which demobilizes voters (or has them looking to Republicans for answers), or the Republicans themselves, or the 46% of Americans who don’t vote, the ruling class, along with the two major parties and the media, encourage everyone to blame the defeat of any Democrat on the Green Party or other independent campaigns. But this [**“spoiler argument”**](https://www.gp.org/dadoonan/nader_not_a_spoiler) is largely a myth.

In the Florida 2000 election, for example, Bush won by 537 votes if we accept the official count. Eight third-party candidates tallied more than that number. (Somehow only Ralph Nader is singled out in the public discourse as “the spoiler.”) At the same time, however, it is estimated that 378,000 Democrats in Florida voted for Bush — almost four times more votes than Nader received. Clearly, what matters most here is not what Nader did but what the Democrats themselves did (or failed to do).

Likewise in 2016. The relatively poor mobilization of those who traditionally vote Democratic, and who would have been expected to cast ballots for Hillary Clinton, was surely caused not by the presence of the Green Party on the ballot but by the uninspiring campaign that Clinton herself actually ran.

Trump’s base of support, by contrast, came out in large numbers. That was the source of Clinton’s defeat, not any so-called “spoiler” effect from the Green candidate.

Exit polls tell us that the overwhelming majority of Green voters would probably have just stayed home if a Green candidate weren’t on the ballot. They wouldn’t go to the polls to vote for the Democrat. So the Green Party actually brings more citizens into the electoral arena, allowing them to express their preference for a left platform.

If Greens denied these voters that choice by deciding not to run, the result would be completely undemocratic. Everyone should have the opportunity to vote their conscience.

The Green Party has been instrumental in promoting something called “[**ranked choice voting**](https://www.fairvote.org/rcv#where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used)” which would totally eliminate any possibility of a spoiler effect. RCV has now been [**adopted in the state of Maine**](https://www.gp.org/maine_greens_ranked_choice) and for primaries in New York City. A massive campaign is underway in Massachusetts. Every leftist in this country should join in the fight for this critical electoral reform.

### Defeating Donald Trump

Yes, the overt racism of Donald Trump is a problem. But the covert racism of the Democratic Party includes the racism of U.S. foreign policy which imposes an imperial reality on the rest of the world, predominantly made up of people of color, maintaining a global military presence and engaging in military campaigns, always on a bipartisan basis. A victory for covert racism is not a defeat for overt racism, except in form.

It is, of course, still important for Donald Trump to be defeated in 2020. How then might that be achieved?

The 2020 Presidential race, from a very practical point of view, will primarily be shaped by the U.S. ruling class which owns and controls the means of mass public communication in this country. What candidate(s) they decide to back, to what degree and with what methods, will make far more of a difference than anything the left decides to do.

True, a large section of the capitalist class opposed Trump in 2016, making an attempt to discredit him at a decisive moment through the publication of information that would have derailed any other candidacy. What was missing from the calculation, however, was that Trump’s base of support was willing to ignore his lying, alleged sexual assaults, and financial manipulations and probably crimes.

So the tactic failed. But we can reasonably expect more sophisticated methods to derail a 2020 Trump campaign — if the ruling class is actually convinced that this is something it needs to do. That suggests organizing in ways that might convince the ruling class that another four years of Trump will be a disaster for them.

Rather than door-knocking for Demo­crats, we need a meaningful effort to generate both substantial mobilizations for social justice and specific forms of organization that the ruling class cannot control. Part of that should include building and strengthening a meaningful electoral alternative in the form of the Green Party — which has maintained a principled antiwar and anti-racist stand for over two decades.

### “Bernie or Bust”

Those who tout Bernie Sanders as the alternative also need to confront the question of covert racism posed above. The groundswell for Bernie results from the fact that he advocates a more equitable share of this nation’s wealth going to working people, a consistent social democratic politics. And yet that entire policy depends on maintaining the source of this wealth, which is the imperial system of U.S. world domination.

It’s a system Sanders has consistently voted to maintain/defend throughout his years in Washington. If that’s true, what effect does it have when socialists offer Sanders their unconditional support?

Then there is the other difficulty: that most of the “Bernie or Bust” advocates will, in fact, follow Bernie himself by campaigning for the eventual Democratic nominee. Ocasio-Cortez will do the same, as will most of her supporters.

This points to the limits of what left-wing Democrats can achieve in their current, and seemingly sincere, efforts to pull the DP to the left. In the end, as has happened repeatedly in the last 50 years, they create a trap for those who want the more leftist rhetoric to actually turn into policy. Their movement will have nowhere to go except becoming a left tail on the right-wing dog of the Democratic establishment — unless it’s prepared to break with the Democrats and join the Green Party or create some new, genuinely independent, formation.

Leftists such as in [**Democratic Socialists of America**](https://www.dsausa.org/) (DSA) who tell us that they support an “inside/outside strategy” can only reasonably make that assertion if there is an outside electoral vehicle that’s able to attract genuinely anticapitalist forces away from the dead end of the Democratic Party.

### The Green Party

The Green Party today is faced with tremendous opportunities. There is rising mass ferment and growing disaffection from the Democratic party. A Gallup poll taken in 2016 reported that 61% of Americans thought there should be a third party, up from 57% in 2015. This includes according to Gallup: 77% of independents (up four points), 52% of Democrats (up nine points), and 49% of Republicans (down two points).

True, the Green Party is confronted by considerable challenges — a media blackout, undemocratic ballot laws, the loss of the equal time provision for candidates, internet trolls, and the smears of Democrats — and will not win the 2020 Presidential elections. It isn’t necessary, however, for the Green Party to win in order for it to have a significant effect, helping to pull politics in this country to the left.

It’s sufficient for the party to field a credible candidate who can effectively challenge racism (overt and covert), imperialism, and other reactionary policies of the Democrats and Republicans, generating enough active support for others to take notice.

And helping to shift the political discourse in this country to the left has, in fact, been one practical effect of past Green Party campaigns.

Consider two issues that are currently part of the mainstream discourse: [**“Medicare for All”**](https://www.gp.org/single_payer) and the[**“Green New Deal.”**](https://www.gp.org/green_new_deal) Both of these ideas were promoted first by the Green Party and its candidates, only later adopted by left and even some mainstream Democrats.

The presence of the Green Party as a strong advocate was at least a significant factor in popularizing these issues and impelling some Democrats to adopt them. Now that they have been adopted we must deal with a different problem: that the “green new deal” being promoted by Democrats does not even begin to solve the global climate crisis. (On this point, [**see Howie Hawkins’ analysis**](https://solidarity-us.org/atc/203/which-green-new-deal/) in the previous issue of Against the Current, November-December 2019.)

So the Green Party’s continued political presence and ongoing critique remains critical in the 2020 election.

In 2012 [**Jill Stein became the most successful female presidential candidate in U.S. history**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Stein_2012_presidential_campaign), winning 469,501 votes. The GP that year tallied more than 11 times more votes than any other national progressive party. It won federal matching funds for the first time, raising over $1 million. The GP hit a high point in ballot access: 38 states comprising 82% of voters. There was a surge in GP registration, volunteer lists, local candidates, and state organizations.

In 2016 the Green Party campaign of [**Stein and Ajamu Baraka**](https://www.jill2016.com/) won 3.1 times more votes (1,457,216) than it did in 2012, 21 times more than any other progressive alternative party.

This was also the highest tally of any independent left presidential candidate in the last 100 years — with the exception of Ralph Nader’s 2,883,105 in 2000.

Stein/Baraka did this with a lot less name recognition than Ralph Nader. Their campaign won federal matching funds two months earlier than in 2012 raising over $3.4 million — triple the 2012 total. Another high point was reached in ballot access: 45 states comprising 89% of voters.

Jill and Ajamu utilized their campaign to mobilize people for the women’s march, the climate march in NYC, against police brutality, and were the only candidates speaking out against imperialist war. All Green Party campaigns are activist campaigns urging voters to not only vote but to become engaged in ongoing struggles for social justice.

This helps us understand why the GP runs candidates for President, and why socialists should support them. The party can achieve a growth in volunteers, in donors, in state and local party activity, in registered voters, coalition partners, visibility in conventional and social media, trained staff and the recruitment of other candidates. Running for President is also a requirement for gaining ballot access in many states, which is only one way a national campaign supports independent state/local efforts.

The number of people who heard about Jill Stein’s campaign in 2016 surely numbered in the tens of millions. She convinced enough of those who heard her message that almost a million and a half cast their votes for the Green Party. Imagine how many more Stein might have influenced had the U.S. left united around her campaign?

### Conclusion

The stronger an alternative like the Green Party becomes, the more votes it has the potential to win, the greater the possibility that the U.S. ruling class will at some point be faced with a truly mass political force to the left of the Democrats which it cannot control. This is the most important element in any ruling-class calculation about what needs to happen in the electoral arena.

If the Democratic Party sees voters leaving the fold it will be forced to move its rhetoric (at least) to the left, and perhaps some if its actual political agenda as well. Campaigning for left-wing Democrats, on the other hand, is much less effective, because in the end all that political energy will be folded into the candidacy of the establishment Democratic nominee. That’s no threat at all to politics-as-usual in the USA.

The orientation we propose is rooted in an understanding that every choice socialists make in immediate campaigns — struggles like those around immigrant rights, against climate change, for prison abolition, a labor strike, or the 2020 elections — should at least attempt to advance two tasks simultaneously: a) winning some immediate goal or objective while b) also getting us closer to the prospect of a revolutionary transformation in the USA.

Under no circumstances can we develop a strategy to gain immediate objectives at the expense of our longer-term goals.

By helping to maintain the power of the Democratic Party and the imperial world system it supports, any effort to promote the Democratic nominee for president in 2020 will undermine these longer-term objectives. It needs to be excluded as a “tactic” on that ground alone.

Support for Bernie Sanders likewise means urging people to get involved in Democratic Party politics, and for many actually backing the eventual Democratic nominee. It therefore raises precisely the same difficulty.

By supporting and building the Green Party, however, we can pursue both our immediate goal of keeping the overt racist from another four years in the White House while also working to bring our longer-term objectives closer.

A stronger Green Party creates a deeper threat to ruling-class politics-as-usual, which can cause those who have far greater power than we do to take more resolute steps to ensure the defeat of Donald Trump.

By supporting the Green Party we also help to promote the self-mobilization and self-organization of the mass movement. Supporting the Green Party is, therefore, by far the best electoral strategy available to the U.S. left in the 2020 Presidential campaign.",2020-01-10T02:32:03+00:00

HOW THE EVOLUTION OF CAPITALISM CAN SAVE THE PLANET

Dedicated to Jonah - for a better world.

&#x200B;

1. Rethink?

There are few, if any, areas of life unaffected by COVID-19. Terms including social distancing, PPE and flattening the curve form part of our everyday conversation. We are necessarily denying our most basic human need to be close and connected to one another because of a virus that forces us physically apart. Irony aside, a worldwide pandemic has brought humanity together into a state of shared experience on a level unlike any in history.

In America the lights shone and the water ran; the delivery trucks still rolled. Do we emerge from this nightmare with a sense of triumph, unapologetically returning to the ways of the past? Or do we proceed with the recognition that a world apparently too big to fail sits on an untenably fragile foundation?

The pandemic is a clarion call that lets us shake off institutional dust that may have settled over time. An unbiased (to the extent possible), open and label-free confrontation of our past is our chance for growth—a true rethink.

At the root of why, with this virus, it is different this time, is a borderless world much more tightly interconnected by trade and travel than it was during the 1918 flu pandemic. Such interconnectedness will work to our advantage if we let it. If we reflect, and turn that reflection into action, we will reach a deeper meaning to this unprecedented global experience.

So how do we make the most of this transition?

2.	Ask ‘Why?’

Rather than spouting a list of societal ills, we can examine root causes. The limits and structures of the biological, anthropological and technological realms that so dictate the form of our commerce and development are not fixed, and the outcomes we took for granted are ripe for change. As business reward systems squeezed the last cent out of the marginal customer’s pocket, few of us questioned them, and even fewer of us had the means to offer alternatives. The forces at work were bigger than us. Coordinated, collaborative economic models found no oxygen.

After all, humanity was forged in the same fiery crucible as all life on earth. Consider competition and the law of the jungle: a lion must be the biggest and most savage to ward off rival lions. This winning survival strategy applies to germs, plants, animals and humans. Indeed, the free market and conventional capitalist systems are patterned on it. Over a billion people were lifted out of extreme poverty under this regime over the last thirty years^(1).  Such a rising tide lifted all boats, and we need not minimize its positive effects.

3.	So what?

Still, the rising tide has been anything but uniform. The majority of US earnings growth accrued to the top 20 percent of earners^(2)  and large corporate interests in the last fifty years. Ordinary, hardworking people were left in a very distant second tier. The structural barriers that deny upward mobility kept quality of life nearly stagnant over the same term for the middle and lower classes. This lack of earnings growth has been estimated to equal $2.5 trillion a year, $47 trillion since 1975^(3).

And why? The short answer, the law of the jungle, dictates that those who hold power hoard power, be it Wall Street bankers, heirs and heiresses to generational fortunes, or corrupt officials. We can observe the historical thread of hoarding, starting with tribal warlords, to monarchs, to the nobility and aristocracy, to the robber barons building the industrialized world, and finally to the utter intoxication of participants in capital markets and government. We also observe little meaningful change to power dynamics along the way.

In the US, layering a democratic government over a free market solves for some of conventional capitalism’s side effects, but perverse incentives are nevertheless cross-pollinated between politics and big business. Furthermore, a constrained government lacks the resources for overwhelming success, and so the bureaucratic class does a poor job with most tasks.

Meanwhile, power hoarders have their thumb on the scale, armed as they are with ruthlessness and a focus on distributive outcomes^(4).  America may be the poster child, but this holds true for basically every place one can think of.

In 2018, the 26 wealthiest people held the same wealth as the bottom 50% of all humanity (3.8 billion people). In 2017 it was the top 43, in 2016 it was the top 61^(5).

4.	An emerging downside

Where does the status quo lead? A system so inherently and so passionately rivalrous works ‘great’ in yesterday’s world, with a billion people, or two billion people, or perhaps even five billion people—not so much at eight billion. Humanity is bumping up against the carrying capacity of earth’s gifts, with its hand on a tinderbox of social tensions ready to blaze. We are all connected; dire consequences from the next Black Swan event, no matter how far away its geographical origin, will not leave us undamaged.

Hardly a path to survival, the status quo in the real world of environmental resource constraints and outsized social power imbalances looks like an extremely bad bet. If we are not yet careening off a Thelma-&-Louise-style cliff at 100 mph, we’re only a thousand yards away going a good 45 mph. Neither braking nor steering away is an option. We must disassemble, re-engineer, and rebuild that Thunderbird convertible and take to the skies before reaching the precipice. Environmental and social tipping points are real, and we need to be planning for the consequences of crossing our first. We are lucky it didn’t come from this virus. Our addiction to some form of capitalism has been millennia in the making, and the institutional inertia is too great to ignore for one more instant.

The question of whether we can escape the forces that defined our past is existential, and the answer, therefore, binds our very future.

5.	Coordinates of the solution(s)

Does answering the question require entirely new technologies, or can we simply make use of existing technologies in novel ways? What features of existing systems—especially conventional capitalism—can be incorporated into a new and improved system with little disruption to the old and tired way of doing things? What tweaks allow for a stable evolution rather than a violent revolution?

Should such adjustments be available, then superior paths forward reveal themselves absent the attachment to any form of politics, economics or ideology. Taking this one step further: how can the best features of established systems coexist while locking out their worst features and consequences?

6.	The silo of low-hanging fruit

We may well strive for wholesale changes in the laws of the land, the roll call of our political representatives, social justice, the economy, or in our collective relationship to the natural world. Balancing our aims with what is realistic, and with what will move the needle, guides our direction.

While all societal silos^(6)  are probably ripe for a refresh, the focus of this document is commerce and economics. As important as the ballot box, economic participation is a weapon the individual can wield on a daily basis. Whereas political elections take place once every two years, we can vote with our wallet each and every day, and the effects are cumulative.

We are not, however, taking this weapon up in a meaningful way. The low-hanging fruit for effecting change is described by the primary pillar of Sustainablism: a sustainable business organization (SBO).

7.	Sustainable Business Organization (SBO)

How businesses are organized dictates how business is done as a system (see Appendix I). The impact of these choices is profound. These are the four defining organizational principles required by Sustainablist firms:

i)	50% employee ownership, 50% customer ownership

ii)	equitably minded governance

iii)	hyper-transparency

iv)	externality^(7)  recapture

(See Appendix II for brief explanations of the principles.)

8.	The SBO footprint

Any industry may contain SBOs, but Sustainablist entrepreneurs should endeavor to create a robust ecosystem of SBOs in the following sectors:

i)	agribusiness

ii)	water supply & sanitation

iii)	apparel

iv)	housing & construction

v)	energy supply

vi)	education

vii)	health care

viii)	transportation & mobility

ix)	communications

Self-determined, democratic control over these sectors is the basic outcome targeted by Sustainablism. Universally high-quality access to these resources should be seen as a prerequisite for a high-functioning, Sustainablist society. Given our daily transactions in these domains, we are overlooking almost all of our opportunity to vote for meaningful upward mobility or other forms of change.

9.	Features and consequences of SBOs

Broadly, SBO entrepreneurs work toward three outcomes:

i)	levelling the socioeconomic playing field (rising tides lift all boats equitably)

ii)	establishing superior economic equilibria^(8)  and outcomes

iii)	reducing the work of government

All four of the SBO organizational principles from section 7 play a role in achieving these outcomes, but a special focus on superior economic equilibria (see Appendix III and this section) makes the strongest case.

To explore what is different in an SBO ecosystem, we have to understand the status quo (see Appendix IV), namely that the basic stock and trade of power hoarders is asymmetric information^(9),  the fungibility of power^(10),  and differential advantage^(11).  These are the thumb-on- the-scale effects that result in errors in the attribution of profit—and, ultimately, inequity.

Profit is a crucial component of SBO transactions, and it is attributed to a firm’s individual owners just as in conventional capitalism. The traditionally accepted view of capitalism is that the pursuit of profit should be the primary goal of the firm. This need not change under Sustainablism. Obviously, should the owners of a firm wish to keep realizing this profit, then decisions that would lead to the collapse of the firm must be avoided. Although there are many decisions to be made for a working SBO, the most important for our immediate discussion relates to setting the market clearing price^(12)  on any good or service.

Let us compare price-setting under conventional capitalism and Sustainablism. Under the former, no firm will:

•	increase prices beyond the point where customers are willing to purchase the good or service produced by the firm: no willingness to pay = no sales = no firm = no profit for the owners

•	decrease prices beyond the point the firm can cover the cost of producing the good or service: no means of production = no sales = no firm = no profit for the owners^(13)

Firms naturally seek the highest possible price for their goods and services, and customers seek the lowest possible price. This tension is settled by the free market and the forces of supply and demand.

In contrast, Sustainablism establishes or assumes the following to achieve equilibrium:

•	firms are composed of employees (specifically, the managerial class^(14)) who set the prices of their goods and services

•	sales are executed with customers, who accept the sales price

•	this setting and acceptance of prices is required for a transaction to take place

•	transactions create profits for owners

•	owners want continuing profits

•	because owners want continuing profits, they will make decisions that ensure the long-term life of the firm (rather than its destruction)

•	Sustainablist firms are 50:50 owned by employees and customers

•	Because ownership of Sustainablist firms is held equally by employees and customers, they must therefore fairly resolve any underlying tensions to set prices so that transactions can take place for themselves, as owners, to realize profit

Under the SBO framework, every transaction involves owners seeking fairness and long-term sustainability. The effect cascades up and down the supply chain because the sellers of goods and services to end consumers are indeed customers themselves (and therefore owners) of their suppliers^(15).  Instead of fighting over 100 percent ‘ownership’ of one side of every transaction, an assemblage of SBO firms effectively becomes 50 percent owners of all sides of every transaction in a given supply chain, with consumption restricted to the goods and services customers actually want to buy, as profit-seeking owners.

Ownership is by far the most important path to wealth and is therefore the most important means of levelling the socioeconomic playing field. Furthermore, with ownership supercharging agency, Sustainablist outcomes flowing from the bottom up gain more traction.

None of this requires the necessary government interventions found in conventional capitalism, nor the central command found in real-world applications of communism (these systems are two sides of the same law-of-the-jungle coin). Nothing conceptual should prevent us from having the same economy under Sustainablism as we do today. If producing a 99¢ hamburger involves cutting down the Brazilian rainforest for grazing and paying burger flippers near poverty wages, and if all economic actors, including customers, workers and resource suppliers, collectively decide^(16)  that what matters is producing that 99¢ hamburger, then that is what we get under Sustainablism. Hyper-transparency requires us to do this with our eyes open, externality recapture assigns a dollar cost to repairing the rainforest, and 50:50 ownership makes paying a living wage a necessity (otherwise we fail to attract any employees). While our Sustainablist stipulations mean we might not have a 99¢ hamburger anymore, whatever arrangements or product we are left with—a pricier, healthier foodstuff or a healthier food-supply chain—will, by definition, increase to the stock of society’s profit.

The superior outcomes resulting from superior equilibria drives economic efficiencies and fosters a mindset of coordination. The pursuit of profit under Sustainablism is a unifying force rather than a rivalrous one.

Because consumers, firms and resource suppliers—all economic actors in a Sustainablist framework—make decisions based on self-interest and against self-harm, government expenditure on legislating, regulating or policing corporate activity is meaningfully reduced. By relying on corporations that actually self-regulate with integrity, Sustainablism leads to smaller government while affording the free market leeway to solve our challenges in a coordinated fashion. Sustainablism’s end game, if you will, sees government focused on foreign relations^(17),  the military, large public works and taxation.

Sustainablism’s simple, natural efficiencies of less regulation and inherent cooperation achieve positive change without a forced redistribution of wealth away from power hoarders in the form of higher taxes. Sustainablism moves the invisible hand of the free market, wherever it hovers over the dark side, into the light.

The 50:50 ownership structure stipulated for SBOs is crucial for true long-term sustainability. Equilibrium is balance; any tilt towards one party introduces a drifting force and an eventual reversion to something that looks much like the status quo. Furthermore, the 50:50 structure leads to a positive blurring of the lines of the firm as individual links in supply chains coordinate more and more to produce the best goods and services possible. As the ethos of Sustainablism achieves a meaningful hold on market participants, new entrants may propose alternate ownership structures, but the reader is cautioned that these may amount to a fatal flaw^(18)  and could be the mark of mere virtue-signallers.

For Sustainablism to take hold, consumers will have to vote with their wallets in favor of SBOs. Amenable voters would number in the hundreds of millions, and they should be easy to activate in this particular moment of our history.

To the extent the ideas in this paper resonate, readers need to act to create this demand. If the clawing of power hoarders at the walls of democracy disgusts you, strongly consider your creative role by supporting emerging Sustainablist businesses. Power hoarders don’t yet realize that the bricks they tear down are the same which fortify their vaults.

10.	So, how?

There are only three fundamental problems that need to be solved before Sustainablism can gain a meaningful foothold in the real economy:

i)	the resource problem;

ii)	the technology problem; and

iii)	the coordination problem

We are very fortunate to be living in an age—for now—when we have yet to cross the line marking a general availability of resources. Society needs to act well before this changes.

The technology problem^(19)  is a matter of combining existing solutions rather than one of invention. It can be solved, likely within twelve months, given sufficient resources. Conveniently, this is probably around the same amount of time it will take to fully transition out of a COVID world.

This leaves the coordination problem. The plan for answering that can be found at [https://dunbarscafe.com/](https://dunbarscafe.com/the_plan_and_next_steps.php).

11.	Common criticisms

This is naïve and idealistic

This is optimistic—and there is a massive difference. Whether we experience an economic recession or expansion, it is nothing more than a self-fulfilling prophecy. When people are generally optimistic about their circumstances, they work and spend and the economy grows. When people are generally pessimistic, they cut back on spending, some lose their jobs and the economy shrinks. It really is as simple as that, and we need not shy away from this linkage. We should be leaning into this property and applying it to other areas of commerce. At its core, the establishment of Sustainablism represents the weaponization of optimism in a parallel economy. If people are made aware of Sustainablism and are conceptually tuned to demand the goods and services offered by SBOs, SBOs will form and fill this need^(20).

Sustainablism doesn’t require everyone’s optimism to be feasible; pessimists will remain in the larger, original system for some time. If Sustainablism is to become the dominant system, however, it does require the optimists to outcompete the pessimists. Within the fundamentally cooperative infrastructure set by SBOs, and with a levelling of the playing field that results, this should prove eminently workable.

Meanwhile, pessimists will convert to optimism in a virtuous cycle. Why? Pessimists aren’t really pessimists, they just don’t see another way. Optimists need to start showing them one, and there are certainly enough of us out there. In other words, once we hit Sustainablist critical mass, it will trigger a positive social tipping point.

This is communism/socialism

Every communist and socialist society submits to the heavy hand of central planning, bloated bureaucracies, public ownership and power hoarding that characterizes conventional capitalism. This is in opposition to what is described by Sustainablism.

Unlike communism, Sustainablism is not in conflict with conventional capitalism in any way whatsoever. Indeed, it is a form of capitalism and uses the same levers—no revolution required. With a bit of insight we can ‘hack’ our economy and change the status quo and its consequences.

The Sustainablist system relies on individual choice and private ownership to direct the economy. The profit from transactions is not directed to the single commons of socialism^(21);  rather, people direct their transactions to a commons that they themselves define, own and control. In other words, those that create profit decide where that value goes. Sustainablism is the most democratic and freedom-aligned way of organizing economic infrastructure.

This will stifle innovation

If the ownership share of entrepreneurs, as the founders of SBO firms, is reduced as it is shared with employees and customers, will they have the incentive to innovate in the first place? Firstly, money’s role as a motivator is overestimated when the fate of the planet is at stake, especially for millennials and Generation Z. Secondly, founders can still command very high compensation through their salaries. Finally, the initial ecosystem of SBOs will be focused on rolling out and scaling up existing technology in food, housing, and energy to consumers rather than creating new technologies. There is plenty of incentive for the  development of new technologies within the status quo of concentrated founder ownership, venture capital, and institutional investment in IPOs. A transitional stage may last decades, and we will not likely see innovative, high-risk startups organized as SBOs until a new generation of entrepreneurs is born into a Sustainablist economic system.

This off-ramp of sorts puts society into two classes: the innovative class, which develops new technology under the status quo, and the virtuous class, which scales existing technology using SBOs. These labels are for convenience only and are not meant to be mutually exclusive; the innovative class needs to be virtuous and the virtuous class needs to be innovative.

12.	Conclusion

Sustainablism is a centrist approach to economic thought,  the design of which should appeal to everyone across the political spectrum. It encompasses the ideals of universal access to food, shelter and the like while clinging tightly to the free market, private ownership and the maintenance of a class system. It is capitalist with respect to rules and processes and socially conscious with respect to outcomes.

Business can no longer afford to look the other way; stakeholders increasingly demand that commercial enterprise align with their values. The four organizational principles of SBOs guarantees this alignment across different supply chains and through the economy. Sustainablism requires no new technologies, and it incorporates some of the best features of existing economic systems while locking out their worst features.

In a free market system where competition ensures that humanity is always in its best age in the present moment, it is naïve to assume that there is no room for improvement. If the availability of the latest and greatest <insert your favorite product here> is a result of efficient competition between the elements within a system, what healthy outcomes arise from competition between parallel systems? Add the field of business organization to the list of those undergoing a restructuring in 2021.

While Sustainablism may not prove to be the answer, it is a very good candidate as a starting point. This paper is meant to jumpstart us into actually living the search for a new way of doing things and not just having a conversation about it. ‘Innovate or die’ never rang more true than it does today.

As we look toward a world without COVID-19, we ask: What world do we want to emerge into? How will we reconnect with each other? What will future generations say about what we made out of these circumstances and our legacy? Will the human world ultimately be one of stewardship and balance? Or will it be one of ruin? If your answer is the same as mine, let’s make the world a better place together.

GreenParty,post,Negotiations,16e4g9y,AnthonyofBoston,"A new book on Amazon entitled ""Steep Goals and Rabbit Holes"" lays out how the democrats in opposing Trump, would find themselves stuck in an open borders, separatist, pro-war rabbit hole, of which they could never climb out of","Initially, former President Donald Trump tried to push ""All Lives Matter"" and tried to call the country together, but was not given the honor. In fact, it was the Democrats who were the first proponents of ""All Lives Matter."" It wasn't until Trump uttered the same words that the democrats would ditch the ""All Lives Matter” platform. It was blatant contrarianism at its best and now look at the racialized mess the United States is in. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley each used the phrase ""All Lives Matter"" early in their campaign, but would concede to ethnocentric diatribes from groups who were threatening to withdraw their support. Sen. Bernie Sanders, at one of his rallies, had even said, 'Black lives matter, white lives matter, Hispanic lives matter.' But when it came to Trump, the media continued to vilify him for his “All Lives Matter” stance, even after he publicly disavowed the alt-right and David Duke on numerous occasions. Eventually, though, the democrats would have to try the same thing—reunify the country—in the midst of all this separatism. But since they allowed themselves to go down a rabbit hole, thinking everyone would forget how they advocated seperatism and open borders, they now have to manage these two outlooks without alienating their political base. It’s important to note that a divided country is unsustainable in a capitalist country where people have to compete with each other for jobs and resources. Being divided along racial lines just adds fuel to the fire. The two don't mix. This is the new normal that our willingness to go to the extreme has brung us. Now the country has to deal with this. There is no going back to a time in which both negative and positive interactions didn't draw the extreme racist connotation it does now. One can best believe that when they go out and their day is inconvenienced by someone that doesn't represent their racial, cultural background, all of them—right or left—will wonder whether or not race played a role in it. Here is the lesson. Never sabatoge your political opposition by destroying the country, all for the sake of pointing the finger at the people in charge. Because, in the event that you come to power, you’ll find yourself left with the impossible task of trying to convince the public that you really don’t advocate for the destructive polices that you once propagated just prior to your ascent. Now the democrats are left holding the bag of racial separatism, open borders, and criminalizing political opposition, trying to figure out a way to walk all of it back. But its sad to say, that they are now stuck with it. The extreme left castigated the ideas of “All Lives Matter,” and “securing the borders” when Trump was in office, and now that they are in power, they are left with these bizarre ideas, both of which their supporters now expect them to uphold. Not to mention, the democrats are pro-war now, which is another rabbit hole they went down as a result of Trump derangement syndrome, believing that Trump was pro-Russian/pro-negotiation and because they don’t support Trump, then they must seek to be anti-Russian, anti-negotiation as a way to distance themselves from Trump. The logic is bizarre.

They claim that a realistic plan of saving the world would be redistributing rearmament money into environmental projects.

The group says that the annual army budgets around the world is 1.500.000.000.000 euros. They say that it has been calculated that 1/6 of that money would be enough to make Sahara desert green i.e. forest it. They also say that money should also be used to fund education in different countries and to fund other environmental and social projects.

The goal of the group is to collect signings to the campaign and introduce it to UN. They hope that it would lead to negotiations and actions among the superpowers worldwide to aim military budgets to environmental projects.

However, they dont believe that uniting the armies could be realisitic within short period of time e.g. wihtin 5-10 years. One superpower wont cut their military budget if other countries dont cut too. That is why they hope that the UN could be leading the negotiations.

Their website is very ""old-school"" looking but dont let it bother. You can support their initiative via the link.

GreenParty,post,Negotiations,rtu3ak,DustyBogey,COP26 reflections.,"Hi all, I was lucky enough to volunteer at COP26 and had an insight into conversations happening at many levels there. This is me reporting back. 

The official, high-level conversations being had at COP26 are primarily a media circus. The pledges made are not binding and the negotiating rooms are currently full of the vested interests who got us into this mess.

There is, none-the-less, plenty of meaningful action happening. Green parties, Socialist (red-green) parties, civil society (associations and charities), indigenous groups, youth groups, marches, and direct action.

The system of power will naturally act to oppose all meaningful challenges to it. Therefore you can generally gauge the efficacy of an action by how much it is suppressed by the authorities.

I really approved of the Green parties of Europe, having attended a panel hosted by them. They are pushing for the adoption of post-growth economic policies, and seem to be coherent in this effort, and furthermore, framed it in a way whereby it was clear that it would improve people's quality of life, which is good to see. 

Post-growth economics was a big topic of discussion among political activists and campaigners. It is definitely an ideology force on the up. My main education in this comes from Tim Jackson's Prosperity without Growth, (2nd ed.), which I can highly recommend. Interestingly, with reference to point 3, there was no discussion of systemic or economic change within the official zone, despite 2 weeks of talks. 

Music, culture, sport and the arts are vital for bringing people together and creating trust between people who are fighting for change.

How to get involved politically (beyond individual action).

Join something! XR is a good start and definitely get stuff done, although they're not perfect, but who is. Green parties are also good. Find people who know what they are doing and learn tactics from them.

Engage with democratic processes. Vote at local and national levels.

Look after yourself, avoiding burnout is important. You don't have to be a hero, and resisting/building better alternatives is allowed to be fun.

Actively seek out community. It doesn't have to be political what-so-ever, but community power is real and effective. I also reckon the more community you have, the more secure you'll generally feel, and the less you will consume.",2022-01-01T22:17:52+00:00

GreenParty,post,Negotiations,4lx363,odog502,The Green Party's #1 priority should be to spoil elections and demand Instant Runoff Voting (Alternative Vote) (x-post from /r/Green),"The biggest obstacle any 3rd parties face is simply being considered a viable option.  The current [plurality/First Past The Post](https://youtu.be/s7tWHJfhiyo) system makes winning an election by any third party an uphill battle at easiest and impossible in most cases.  The Green Party's #1 priority should be to use the little power it has as a spoiler to pressure Democrats to champion [Instant Runoff Voting/Alternative Vote](https://youtu.be/3Y3jE3B8HsE).  No other Green causes can move forward without making it possible to win elections first.  [IRV is on the Green Party platform](http://www.gp.org/democracy#DemPoliticalReform) but I see it discussed so little.

When David Cobb ran for President on the Green ticket in 2004 he chose a [""Smart States""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cobb_presidential_campaign,_2004) strategy which emphasized states that were secure Democrat/Republican states and ignoring battleground states.  The reason for this strategy was because the Democrats cried foul after Nader spoiled the election for Gore, causing Bush to win the election.  Cobb's strategy was flawed however, because it essentially just gave the Democrats what they wanted, no competition from Greens.  Cobb had the initiative and could have pressed the matter further but essentially backed down in 2004.  We got nothing for it and Bush was still elected.  Now look at our present situation.  Is Hillary vs Trump any improvement from Bush vs Kerry?  Don't expect it to get any better in the future by voting for the lesser of two evils.

The only influence Greens have in this system is the spoiler effect.  And to not use it is the same as not running a campaign at all.  If Greens had kept the momentum from 2000 going with the same strategy in 2004, Democrats would have realized that their whining didn't work and they would have to start negotiating.  But their whining did work, because we let it.

I've noticed that IRV is mysteriously absent from the [Libertarian platform](https://www.lp.org/platform), but I see no reason why it should be.  Libertarians can be affecting the Republicans in the same way.  Greens should reach out to Libertarians and develop a joint strategy emphasizing the spoiling of different races.

No other issue on either party's platform can make headway until we get elected first.  And to get elected we need IRV.  To get IRV we need to spoil elections.

This is what I suggest in a nutshell:

* Green Federal level campaigns(Congress, Senate, President), should not be focused on winning, but on spoiling(unless polls actually show that the Green has a chance of winning).  Campaigning should be the hardest in battleground areas.
* When Democrats complain, double down and pledge to continue doing the same in every future election.  Don't negotiate as they can always back down from a promise.  The power is in the hands of the Democrats, they are able to fix this if they wish to.
* Create a partnership with Libertarians to do the same thing to Republicans, choosing together which contests to specifically focus on.
* Instant Runoff Voting will now become a higher priority for the Democrats and the Republicans as they realize the only way to stop the spoiling is to eliminate the spoiler effect.
* Once Instant Runoff Voting is implemented, we can now compete normally in elections and stand a chance of pursuing the other causes in our platform.

As a sidenote the only other candidate that has IRV in their platform is [Bernie Sanders](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-political-and-electoral-reform/#the-two-party-system).  He is the only other candidate I'm considering voting for.",2016-05-31T19:40:12+00:00

Israel has industrialized murder. And no, I don't believe the IDF when they say that they are actually reviewing each target. They have been caught lying numerous times, obstructed third-party investigations into their war crimes, and murdered journalists and doctors in broad daylight. 

&#x200B;

>Btw, do you also scream about the Russians with this level of intensity? How about the Syrian government against its own people? Chinese against the Uyghurs?

I do, but here's the key difference that you're ignoring to fit your morally bankrupt ""everyone who criticizes Isreal for committing genocide is an anti-semite"" narrative. 

My country isn't actively providing arms to further those crimes against humanity. 

My country isn't the actively blocking UN resolutions to address those crimes against humanity. 

&#x200B;

>How about the Apartheid perpetrated throughout the centuries against the Jews in Arab societies?

Yeah, I retroactively condemn those crimes against humanity but again, my country isn't actively funding and arming those parties.

USpolitics,post,West Bank,4wvp22,ShaunaDorothy,"Hillary, Queen of War: The Road Map Ahead - by Pepe Escobar (x-post /r/WorkersVanguard)","It all starts with a Wahhabi-Zionist lovefest.

The Saudi Foreign Ministry was forced to go on a non-denial denial overdrive about a visit to Israel on July 22 by a delegation led by retired Gen. Anwar Eshki.

Eshki happens to be close to Saudi intel superstar and onetime close Osama bin Laden pal Prince Turki bin Faisal, who recently met in the open with former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) generals Yaakov Amidror and Amos Yadlin.

While in Israel, Eshki met with Foreign Ministry Director-General Dore Gold, and Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, the top IDF honcho in the West Bank.

There’s absolutely no way the House of Saud would not have given a green light for such a visit – and such high-level meetings. By the way, the Interior Ministry in Saudi Arabia bans all travel to Israel – as well as Iran and Iraq.

So what’s the big deal? The Israelis spun it as the Saudis – fronting for the Arab League — offering a normalization of ties with the Arab world without Israel abdicating from anything on the Palestinian front. The only thing Tel Aviv would have to do, much later, is to adopt the 2002, Saudi-proposed Arab peace initiative.

That’s nonsense. For starters, the ultra right-wing Zionists in power in Tel Aviv will never accept reverting to the pre-1967 borders and recognizing the state of Palestine. What was “discussed” was a non-deal, even as Tel Aviv gloats, “important Arab states are willing to openly embrace us even though we have not given up one inch of the West Bank and even as we continue to control Al-Aqsa Mosque.”

If the Arab League would ever embark in such a blatant non-deal, forever throwing the Palestinians under myriad bulldozers, chances are oligarchies/petromonarchies all across the spectrum should start booking that one-way ticket to London.

That Moscow-Tehran-Ankara alliance

So what did they actually talk about? Predictably, the imminent prospect of the Full Spectrum Dominatrix finally taking over the White House.

Both Bibi Netanyahu in Tel Aviv and de facto House of Saud ruler and Prince of War Mohammad bin Salman in Riyadh have been reduced, under the Obama administration, to the status of proverbial, euphemistic “estranged allies”. Between them, they are de facto allies – even as they cannot admit it to the Arab street. Both are dead sure, under the Queen of War, there will be – what else – war. The question is against whom.

Informed speculation points towards the Saudi/Israeli common enemy, Iran. That’s complicated. The joint Saudi/Israeli strategy across the Middle East is indeed in tatters. Tehran has not been trapped in a quagmire neither in Syria nor in Iraq. ISIS/ISIL/Daesh and assorted “moderate rebels” – covertly supported by the Saudi/Israeli axis — are on the run, even if they insist they are not “al-Qaeda” anymore. Prince of War bin Salman is entrapped himself in an unwinnable war on Yemen.

And then there’s the spectacular post-coup pivot by Sultan Erdogan in Turkey – for all practical purposes abandoning those elaborate no-fly-zone dreams of annexing a post-Assad Syria to his neo-Ottoman set up.

The House of Saud is livid as Turkish diplomats have started to spread this blockbuster news: Erdogan has proposed to Iran’s Rouhani an all-embracing alliance with President Putin to finally solve the Middle East riddle.

Whatever erratic Erdogan’s agenda may be, a possible ice-breaking new deal between Moscow and Ankara will be discussed de facto in the upcoming Putin-Erdogan face-to-face meeting. All geopolitical signs at this stage point – albeit tentatively – towards a revived Russia/Iran/Turkey alliance, even as a horrified House of Saud is going no holds barred to gain Moscow’s trust by offering “untold wealth” and privileged access to the GCC market.

As confirmed by a top Western intel source, “the Saudis are definitely keeping all contacts open with the Kremlin. The Saudi King is in Tangiers now and has met Russian envoys there. They mean what they say. But Putin will not abandon Assad. There has to be a compromise. Both need it.”

President Putin is in a privileged spot. Even without accepting the Saudi offer – which is just a promise, with no ironclad guarantees – Russia holds the best cards, as in a quite problematic but ultimately feasible Moscow-Tehran-Ankara alliance that is all about Eurasian integration (and a future seat for Turkey, alongside Iran, in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, SCO.)

A Saudi-Moscow alliance for its part would inevitably lead a Queen of War administration towards – what else — regime change in Riyadh disguised as R2P; “responsibility to protect” the Saudi populace. One should expect Hillary crony Samantha Power to vehemently defend it at the UN.

It’s all about The Three Harpies

Yet considering the Queen of War’s instincts, all signs do point towards Iran.

The manual/blueprint/road map for Hillary’s wars is arguably here, in this very dangerous intersection between US neocons and neoliberalcons. The CNAS think tank is led by one-third (Michele Flournoy) of what I have dubbed The Three Harpies; Hillary Clinton, Flournoy and – the most terrifying words in the English language – Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, the possible lethal trio in charge of foreign policy under a Clinton Three administration.

This is in fact PNAC (the Project for a New American Century) on steroids, with echoes of the warlike 1992 US Defense Planning Guidance disguised under the soothing rhetoric of benevolent hegemony and “rules-based international order”. If the Trump campaign managed to restrain his motormouth and/or motortweet instincts and focus on what this warmongering opus means for the US and the world at large they would strike a chord with millions of undecided US voters.

For all her bluster, and that will be elevated to unheard-of hysterical levels, the Full Spectrum Dominatrix won’t be foolish enough to launch a war – which will inevitably be nuclear – against either Russia (Baltics as a pretext) or China (South China Sea as a pretext), the Pentagon’s top two “existential threats”.

In Syria, on the other hand, by January 2017 al-Qaeda/not al-Qaeda goons formerly known as “moderate rebels” will be mostly six feet under.

Erdogan may be making NATO’s life in Turkey unbearable. As the Queen of War is in AIPAC’s pocket, and considering the Clinton Foundation’s by now legendary cozy ties with the House of Saud, the war target would have to be the Saudi/Israeli preferred target, on top of it pro-Damascus and in close touch with both Ankara and Moscow: Iran.

But how to pull it off? One avenue, already being explored, is to bomb by all means — and not figuratively — the Iran nuclear deal. A concerted campaign in US mainstream media is already burying the deal; and even Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei – as reported in the US – is on the record saying Washington cannot be trusted; ‘‘They tell us ‘Let’s talk about regional issues, too.’ But the experience of the nuclear deal suggests this is deadly poison and in no way can the Americans be trusted.’’

So expect from Team Clinton the proverbial media barrage of dodgy spin, baseless accusations and the occasional, perfectly positioned false flag to lure Tehran intro a trap, like, for instance, in neoliberalcon wishful thinking, Iran reviving its nuclear program. Of course this won’t happen, but a Hellfire barrage of disinformation will be used by the powerful anti-Iran lobby in the US Congress to sort of make it happen, even as an illusion.

And all this while Iran, among other development matters, is busy planning a new transportation corridor from the Persian Gulf to the Black Sea, connecting to Armenia, Georgia and Bulgaria, and positioning the nation as a key trade hub connecting the Arab world in the south and west; Central Asia in the north; and Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east, all the way to Europe. Once again, Eurasian integration on the move.

Tehran has myriad reasons to be on red alert if the Full Spectrum Dominatrix gets her hands on the nuclear codes (how’s that not scarier than Trump?) She will act as a surefire faithful servant of the Saudi/Israeli alliance. The road map is ready. And neocons and neoliberalcons alike can hardly contain their excitement at seeing in action “a force that can flex across several different mission sets and prevail.”

We annually spend on military security alone more than the net income of all United States corporations.

Now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence—economic, political, even spiritual—is felt in every city, every Statehouse, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet, we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved. So is the very structure of our society.

In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.

Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades.

In this revolution, research has become central, it also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal government.

...

The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocation, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.

Yet in holding scientific discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.",2023-11-06T18:52:42+00:00

This is unprecedented.  This is insane.  This man is ultimately suggesting an authoritarian nation.  He wants democracy (or what's left of it in this oligarchy disguised as a democracy) to cease to exist.  How do Trump supporters make excuses for a man that does not want us to be able to choose, calls veterans of wars suckers and losers, makes fun of the handicapped, practices blatant mysoginy, sexism, and nationalism, downplays a pandemic allowing the worst loss of life since the Vietnam War, allows for foreign interference, blatantly admitted he'll be a sore loser if he loses, is accused of countless sexual assaults, is connected deeply to a known pedophile, went through countless cabinet members, was called a spoon fed enabled idiot by his own family and the most powerful ranking members of both the US Government and US Military, has lied on record more times than all Presidents both living and dead, and is the first and only president in history to divide, propagate panic, discourage voting through a 0.00001% chance at mail fraud, lie to the American people repeatedly, and name-call like a child everyone and anything that opposes him in a showing of obvious pathological narcissism and inability to work across the aisle?  How?  Only answer I can surmise is it just pure brainwashed indoctrination and the systematic defunding of education in America since the 80s.

USpolitics,post,Peace process,p5t0ic,northstardim,Rumsfeld's military and how we have gotten heavily into Africa without the public even knowing,"Rumsfeld redesigned the lines of authority within the Pentagon and set out many black ops organizations all under his SECDEF leadership.  What this means is there are only 8 members of congress who even know about those operations.  This gang of 8 includes both republican and democratic leaders of the house and senate who run the committees responsible for military funding and are sworn to secrecy about this information.

The funding for those operations come through the military budget process only as black ops with zero details.  Congress depends upon this gang of 8 to approve them and so far they have not disapproved any of them essentially giving them carte blanc for anything.

While the Africa command is well known and offers the public face of our military in Africa, they officially offer explanations of peace keeping and/or well drilling as their primary claims for operations.  But in reality what our black ops people do is far more than that. What we do can be ""Training"" or ""ride along"" in other country's operations many times becoming actively involved in what was never meant to be our fights but somehow we get involved anyway.

Africa is now the focus of far too many outside forces such as China getting their fingers in mining and oil there in Africa which inevitably means control of vast tracts of African landscape.

Africa could easily become the next Afghanistan for the US.  Except instead of a single country it will be nearly Africa wide.  There are currently over 600 black ops operations scattered throughout the continent where American soldiers are risking their lives for questionable reasons none of it covered by  congress, none of it publicly known.",2021-08-17T00:36:18+00:00
USpolitics,post,Peace process,jpdcnh,Sundburnt,Post Election To Do List (Please Feel Free To Add To This)," 

Post Election To Do List: 

* Treat entire Trump Family as “Flight Risk” and detain them immediately. Marine One should just take him directly to a prison “for his own safety” where he is met by a representative from every agency that is planning on charging him/ them. 
* Dejoy should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 
* Make sure that all jail/prison cells have live webcams that the public can monitor 24-hours a day, since we can’t trust private agencies to monitor the prisoners. 
* Trump’s “Lame Duck Session” should be the lamest duck that ever ducked. He should have to just sit there and watch as the rest of the country flat out ignores him. 
* Make Trump pay back all the taxpayer money that was spent on his businesses during his presidency. Sell all of that gold furniture to pay for it. Take the clothes off of  his back. 
* File charges against Members of Congress who were insider trading in March after the Covid briefing. Yes, even Feinstein. 
* Dismantle the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. 
* Begin process of releasing detainees at ICE Detention Facilities. Begin working on re-associating families separated by Trump’s border policies. Put them all up in the mega churches around the border, or Trump Tower Las Vegas, or Fry’s.
* Issue a Cease and Desist order to all pipelines being built on Indigenous peoples lands. 
* Impeach McConnel, and Lyndsey Graham for their part in the Trump Supreme Court Appointments, and stolen appointment from Obama. *There has to be justice to be found somewhere in regards to this. And not just adding seats to the court. What McConnel and Graham did was criminally wrong and should not be tolerated. If we just add more seats and don’t address McConnell and Grahams actions, then this will happen again and one party will be able to bully the other to get more lifetime appointments again.* 
* Get rid of the filibuster.
* Recommit to Paris Climate Agreement
* Reinstate the standards that were reversed by Trump for Auto emission Standards, Greenhouse Gas emissions for businesses, National Parks protected lands 
* Get rid of the Electoral College 
* Move to run off elections. 
* Cap Campaign spending and make it a law that for every dollar spent on the campaign they must make a matching donation to homelessness in America
* Shut down the Space Force.
* Create a Dept. of Peace to make a new Civil Service Force made up of homeless veterans. After a bit of training, they will become a force to deal with homelessness, providing shelter, training, education, mental health services, counseling and a purpose in helping to recycle people into healthy productive members of society. 
* Build 4 more USN Hospital Ships as a gesture of goodwill to the rest of the world. Their mission would be to aid in times of disasters  (not necessarily Covid, but earthquakes, tsunami, etc.). 
* Put Congress on the same health care plan as the rest of the country. Perhaps then, they will be interested in fixing it. 
* Tax all churches.
* Disband the Republican party for the crime of conspiracy against the United States of America. And ban all party leaders from participating in American Politics for two presidential terms at minimum.  Name individual members of the party as co-conspirators on every charge directed against Donald Trump for their complacentry.",2020-11-06T21:00:34+00:00

An alliance with Hong Kong is much better than an alliance with Taiwan, let us not forget that we had a strong deal with Hong Kong for decades upon decades and the business ties were much stronger. Hong Kong has done much more for us than Taiwan and now their power is slowly being diminished. More and more companies move out, go bankrupt, or get bought by the Mandarin speaking Han Chinese community. And they are also big partners of our partners. The British. Together, we can have a triple alliance which is much better than one with Taiwan. 

We should take note of how awful this is but due to our limitations on options and lack of power to send a military force there to take HK and clear it of Chinese influence, we should instead make a deal with them whereby we swipe support for Taiwan and just let them snatch it in exchange for control of Hong Kong.

WTF don't you understand about talking tough concerning missile defense to the naive sheeple Americans (you and the rest) and then bending over for the Russians in his typical, appease everyone, please  can't we all get along mentality.  Another lie told to our  allies and to the American people for the sake of political expediency during election time.

If you ask me, yes they should buy other countries and turn them into states. It's a better idea than trying to build a wall (cough cough Trump) or letting migrants come in all Willy Nilly without legal documentation (cough cough Biden). 

Turning countries into states would be a good thing because we can fix any dumb laws that country has and impliment ours. For example, Colombia has a problem with theives stealing phones and no one is doing anything about except saying ""Oh I wanna go to the United States so badly, but it's hard to get a Visa"". That and their  current President (Gustavo Petro) is so corrupt that he's releasing prisoners for no reason. If we bought Colombia and turned it into a state, then we can offer these Colombians the right to bear arms so that they can fight back and impeach Petro by electing a real American Governor to run Colombia.

Another reason to buy other countries is to have the numbers and strength to keep Vladimir Puta at bay. The more land we have, the less likely he'll keep fucking around with his KGB commie ideals that he's putting on Ukraine.

The whole world needs a taste of American freedom. You don't hear Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and Virgin Islands complaining.

USpolitics,post,Two-state solution,173th4i,Georgeo57,AI Peacemaker Test: What would cause the United States to support a two state plan to end the war in Israel?,"There are a number of factors that could cause the United States to support a two-state plan to end the war in Israel. These include:

* **A change in Israeli public opinion:** If there is a significant increase in support for a two-state solution among Israeli voters, the US government may be more likely to pressure Israel to pursue this option.
* **A regional initiative:** If a group of Arab countries were to come forward with a comprehensive peace proposal that includes a two-state solution, the US government may be more likely to support it.
* **A new US administration:** If a US administration is elected that is more committed to the two-state solution, it may be more likely to put pressure on both sides to reach an agreement.
* **A humanitarian crisis:** If the humanitarian situation in Gaza deteriorates significantly, the US government may be more likely to support a two-state solution as a way to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people.
* **A growing threat from Iran:** If the US government perceives Iran as a growing threat, it may be more likely to support a two-state solution as a way to promote stability in the region.

It is important to note that there are also a number of factors that could prevent the United States from supporting a two-state solution. These include:

* **The political situation in Israel:** If the Israeli government is opposed to a two-state solution, it will be difficult for the US government to pressure Israel to pursue this option.
* **The domestic political climate in the US:** If the US public is not supportive of a two-state solution, it will be difficult for the US government to take a leading role in promoting it.
* **The opposition of regional actors:** If key regional actors, such as Iran and Syria, are opposed to a two-state solution, it will be difficult for the US government to implement it.

Overall, the decision of whether or not to support a two-state solution is a complex one that will be influenced by a variety of factors. The US government has traditionally supported a two-state solution, but it is unclear whether it will continue to do so if the current situation does not change.

“You’ve come a long way, baby,” crooned the old Virginia Slims commercials on TV in the late 1960s, and the bourgeois media has picked up the tune again on this, the fiftieth anniversary of the Pill (no further definition necessary—everyone knows you are talking about s-e-x). And everyone knows the Pill is all about sex. When in 1975 Loretta Lynn sang, “I’m tearin’ down your brooder house ’cause now I’ve got the pill,” the hearts of millions of women across America beat in time to the rhythm of her song, which dozens of radio stations tried to censor—until it made the hit charts.

The Pill was the first reliable contraceptive that gave women control over their own reproduction. This tremendous medical advance enabled women to separate sexual enjoyment from fear of pregnancy, freeing them from the now excessive fertility with which evolution has endowed our species. But birth control and abortion remain restricted throughout the capitalist world by the state, by the institution of the family, and by organized religion, which all serve to enforce women’s oppression. As long as the capitalist order exists, the benefits of science will be limited by the exploitation and oppression of this class system. Marxists look forward to the day when science can be “applied with full understanding to all the fields of human activity,” to quote the words of German socialist leader August Bebel, whose 1879 work Woman and Socialism was one of the first major Marxist works on the woman question.

Leon Trotsky, co-leader with V.I. Lenin of the 1917 October Revolution, underlined that birth control and abortion are among woman’s “most important civil, political and cultural rights” (The Revolution Betrayed [1936]). We fight for women’s liberation through socialist revolution. We call for free abortion on demand as part of free, quality health care for all and for free, 24-hour childcare to address the deep class and racial oppression of poor and minority women. The wealthy will always get their medical care, including their abortions, while myriad anti-abortion laws and restrictions on birth control target young, working-class and poor women, who can’t afford quality health care, childcare and housing.

At the time of its first release by the pharmaceutical company Searle, big predictions were made about the effect that the Pill would have on society. Moral bigots wailed that it would promote female promiscuity and the decline of religion and the patriarchal family, while birth control advocates believed it would save the family, create happy marriages and end the world population explosion. The Pill was even hailed as the solution to the “Red Menace.” In her book America and the Pill: A History of Promise, Peril, and Liberation (Basic Books, 2010), historian Elaine May speaks of how some Cold Warriors believed that the Pill “would alleviate the conditions of poverty and unrest that might lead developing nations to embrace communism, and instead promote the growth of markets for consumer goods and the embrace of capitalism.”

In fact, the “sexual revolution” that is often credited to the Pill was the result, in one way or another, of the convulsive social struggles of the civil rights movement, which broke the back of Jim Crow segregation in the South, and of opposition to U.S. imperialism’s war against the Vietnamese Revolution. The major social upheavals of the 1960s that broke up the reactionary Cold War consensus also led to substantial advances in access to higher education and professional jobs for women. At the same time, the civil rights movement could not eradicate the race-color caste oppression of black people, which is the bedrock of American capitalism, just as the institution of the family, the main source of women’s oppression in capitalist society, is a bulwark of the bourgeois order.

Abortion Rights Under Attack

While U.S. bourgeois pundits celebrate the reproductive freedom that the Pill has given women, it is striking that most do not mention the precipitous decline in women’s access to abortion. The assault on women’s right to abortion continues unabated in the courts and halls of government, especially on the state level. As of June, some 370 bills to restrict abortion rights had been introduced this year alone in state legislatures across the country, and many have already passed. These range from Oklahoma’s cruel requirement that a doctor show the woman an ultrasound of the fetus, to Nebraska’s ban on all abortions after 20 weeks based on the claim that the fetus can feel pain. Perhaps the most barbarous is Utah’s new law. Passed after a desperate 17-year-old paid a man $150 to beat her in an effort to induce a miscarriage, the law now allows homicide charges against women in similar cases! Meanwhile, the lies that abortion causes depression and breast cancer continue to circulate, and some recent polls show that for the first time more Americans call themselves “pro-life” than “pro-choice.”

The arsenal of legal measures on the federal as well as the state level has already made abortion virtually inaccessible to a large number of women. Thirty-eight states prohibit abortions after a specified point in pregnancy. Fully 35 states require one or both parents of women under 18 to be notified and/or consent to an abortion. Some 87 percent of U.S. counties and 31 percent of metropolitan areas have no abortion services.

In May 2009, the “pro-life” war on women claimed yet another life. Dr. George Tiller—one of only three doctors whose clinics provide late-term abortions in the United States—was assassinated while attending his church in Wichita, Kansas, by a right-wing anti-abortion bigot. Tiller, a main target of the anti-woman God squad for decades, was the eighth person murdered in this anti-abortion, “family values” onslaught since 1993. In an article titled “The New Abortion Providers,” the New York Times (18 July) details the long decline in the number of doctors trained in performing abortions and tells the story of young doctors in groups like Medical Students for Choice fighting to make abortion part of a doctor’s regular practice. Abortion is a medical procedure, now one of the safest in the world, that does not need to be carried out in isolated clinics, where doctors and their families, friends and co-workers can easily be subjected to harassment, violence and death by anti-abortion fanatics.

Ever since the passage of Roe v. Wade in 1973, the basic democratic right of legal abortion has been under attack. The war on abortion rights has become a spearhead for social and political reaction because at its heart lies the question of legal and social equality for women. Providing women with some control over whether or not to have children, abortion is viewed as a threat to the institution of the family.

Access to contraception, too, is limited by cost and lack of basic information, while “conscience clauses” allow pharmacies to refuse to fill prescriptions for birth control and Plan B, the “morning-after” pill. To all this can be added anti-woman moralizing, which rants that a girl shouldn’t want to have sex. The argument goes that while any unwed mother is a bad girl, if she can claim she got carried away, maybe the sin is not quite as great (as long as she doesn’t have an abortion). But having birth control implies premeditation. Precisely! In the words of the late comedian George Carlin, “Not every ejaculation deserves a name.”

Today sex education in schools is increasingly under attack, while abstinence remains the focus of government-funded programs like the State Personal Responsibility Education Program, established by Barack Obama’s recent health care “reform” act. Abortion clinics are overwhelmingly outnumbered by “pregnancy crisis centers”—fake clinics set up by anti-abortion groups with the purpose of subjecting pregnant women to anti-abortion propaganda and otherwise pressuring them to carry the fetus to term. According to the Nation, some 4,000 of these centers have received over $60 million in federal abstinence and marriage-promotion funds. As a result of the ignorance and miseducation produced by this tangle of social reaction, almost half of pregnancies in the U.S. every year are unplanned, according to the most recent government survey.

While U.S. newspapers headline “The Pill: Making Motherhood Better for 50 Years” (Washington Post, 9 May), the masses of working-class, minority and poor women have missed the celebration. The Great Recession rages on; union-busting is destroying what good union jobs remain; homes are in foreclosure; millions of working people cannot get jobs and their children cannot get a decent education or affordable health care. Except for the women at the very top of society, where the rich are certainly getting richer, the decades-long assault on the working class and the poor has more than canceled out the important improvements in women’s legal status over the last 50 years.

In times of substantial class and social struggle, the capitalist class may be forced to cede some reforms. But as long as the capitalist order remains, the ruling class will seek to overturn these gains, as it is now doing, when such struggles are at an ebb. As revolutionary communists, we defend every gain that’s been won for the exploited and oppressed, such as the gains wrested during the hard struggles of the civil rights movement. But these reforms have a fundamentally token quality to them because they leave untouched the capitalist system. The source of black oppression and anti-woman bigotry is not the particular capitalist party in power—whether Democratic or Republican—but the capitalist order that breeds oppression and bigotry as a necessary corollary to its system of exploitation.

Sex and Social Control

The capitalist class seeks to buttress the family, which, along with organized religion and the state, form a triad that props up the exploitation of labor. To free women from their deeply entrenched special oppression will take a workers revolution to rip this system of exploitation out by the roots and replace it with a workers government to begin the construction of a socialist world. Only then can we undertake the profound changes in the fabric of everyday life where the institution of the family is replaced by socialized childcare and housework, enabling women to fully participate in social and political life.

The family is not an immutable, timeless institution, but a social relation subject to historical change. In his classic 1884 work The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State, Friedrich Engels traced the origin of the family and the state to the division of society into classes. The development of agriculture allowed the creation of a social surplus. In turn, that surplus gave impetus to the development of a leisured ruling class, thus moving human society away from the primitive egalitarianism of the Old Stone Age (Paleolithic). The centrality of the family began with its role in ensuring “legitimate heirs” for the patriarchal inheritance of property, which required women’s sexual monogamy and social subordination. In the 10,000 years since the advent of class society, the family has taken many forms—including polygamous, extended and nuclear—reflecting different political economies and their cultures and religions. But the oppression of women is a fundamental feature of all class societies.

The family is a socially conservatizing force that imposes certain behavioral norms. For example, in this country the definition of “manhood” is, besides getting a girl pregnant, the ability to support a wife and children. But that is becoming ever more difficult given the lack of decent-paying union jobs. If not for wives entering the workforce, the entire bottom 60 percent of the U.S. population would have had real income losses since 1979. At the same time, the institution of the family serves the capitalist rulers by placing the burden of raising a new generation of proletarians on working men and women. Indeed, the “family values” crowd (which encompasses Democrats as well as the Republicans) wails about the so-called “crisis of the family” and insists that it is both right and proper that parents should be wholly responsible for the upbringing of their children.

Even the most cursory examination of laws regulating abortion, contraception and the like that go back thousands of years shows that they are integrally related to the maintenance of the family. Some of the first documented legal measures to strengthen the patriarchal family were enacted in ancient Rome under Augustus Caesar. These included prohibitions against adultery, incentives for widows to remarry, “sin” taxes on bachelors 30 years and older, and incentives for fathers of three or more children. The concern of the government was to have enough Roman citizens to fill the ranks of the army and maintain the city of Rome as the core of the Empire.

Modern abortion laws show how social and legal institutions have changed to reflect the interests of the capitalist class. In 1803 the British Ellenborough Act marked the advent of abortion as a statutory crime in the English-speaking world. The interest of the ruling class in this law and others following it was to protect the male’s right to heirs, punish (especially single) women for illicit sex and encourage population growth for the newly forged capitalist nation-state, its army and labor pool.

Alongside legal prohibition stands religion, the strongest ideological force against birth control and abortion, especially the Roman Catholic church. The claims by the Pope and other clergy about the “souls” of unborn children are revealed as so much superstition by the science of human development. Yet thanks to the reactionary influence of religion, tens of thousands of women die each year from illegal abortions—lives that would have been saved with access to birth control and abortion. A brief look at Catholic doctrine shows that the church has changed its mind several times about when the nonexistent “soul” enters into the conceptus. For most of the existence of the church, this was considered to be the time of “quickening,” at about the fourth month, when the pregnant woman can feel the movement of the fetus. John XXI, who became pope in 1276, was the author of a book called Treasury of Medicines for the Poor, which is the greatest single source of information about the practical means of birth control and abortion that was known in the Middle Ages. It was not until 1869 that Pope Pius IX declared that abortion “from conception” was a sin. This was a political calculation carried out in exchange for recognition of “papal infallibility” by French Emperor Napoleon III, who was seeking to stem France’s decades-long decline in the birth rate.

The woman-hating strictures against birth control and abortion, the poisonous bigotry against homosexuals, the witchhunting of “deviant” sex (who defines that?), the relentless pressure on youth to somehow refrain from giving in to their raging hormones—all these are corollaries of the institution of the family and the social control that it gives the ruling class. As communists we oppose attempts to fit human sexuality into legislated or decreed so-called “norms.” Government out of the bedroom! The guiding principle for sexual relations between people should be that of effective consent—that is, nothing more than mutual agreement and understanding as opposed to coercion. All consensual relations are purely the concern of the individuals involved, and the state has no business interfering in human sexual activity.

Some History of Birth Control

In Contraception and Abortion from the Ancient World to the Renaissance (Harvard University Press, 1994), John M. Riddle explores the ways that pre-industrial people might have tried to enjoy sex without the consequence of procreation. Nobody knows if the methods he documents had much effect on the birth rates, but they certainly show intent. One city in Northern Africa, Cyrene, is believed to have made its name and its fortune from a wild giant fennel that grew nearby, which people believed to have abortifacient effects. Its use became so widespread that it was harvested to extinction.

Peter Fryer, in his witty and erudite book The Birth Controllers, documents that ancient Egyptians used crocodile-dung pessaries (vaginal suppositories) and other dubious methods to control fertility. The Christian Bible’s story of Onan is only the most well known of a long-practiced method (withdrawal), a story used for centuries to put the terror of hell into countless adolescents for masturbation. Some historians believe that the tens of thousands of women who were executed as witches in early modern Europe may have been abortionists and birth control practitioners. In 20th-century America, before the Pill, housewives often resorted to the dangerous practice of douching with Lysol.

In the 1830s, a Massachusetts doctor named Charles Knowlton was the first person in the history of birth control to be sent to prison for advocating it. The United States also has the dubious honor of passing the first nationwide laws prohibiting the dissemination of birth-control methods. In 1873 Congress passed the Comstock Act, named for its sponsor, Postmaster General Anthony Comstock. It outlawed the circulation of contraceptive information and devices through the U.S. postal service as “pornography.” In 1915 Comstock boasted that he had convicted enough people of “sexual misconduct” to fill a 60-car passenger train.

One of Comstock’s prominent targets in later years was Margaret Sanger. Sanger, who would go on to found Planned Parenthood, began her political life as a member of the Socialist Party, working on the party’s women’s committee. She was working as a nurse, visiting immigrants in New York’s Lower East Side, where she saw firsthand the suffering of women whose health had been ruined by too many pregnancies, who were struggling to feed children they could not afford to support, who all too often ended up butchered by some back-alley abortionist. Soon she began writing about sex education and health for the party’s women’s page under the heading, “What Every Girl Should Know.” In early 1913 Comstock banned the column, and the paper ran in its place a box titled “What Every Girl Should Know—Nothing; by order of the U.S. Post Office.”

Sanger soon left the Socialist Party to focus single-mindedly on fighting for birth control, a term that she herself invented. A courageous woman, Sanger set up the first birth control clinic in the country and endured arrests and imprisonment as she sought to overturn the Comstock Law and to educate women and doctors in birth control methods. She traveled to Europe to research the latest techniques and wrote a sex manual in 1926 where she describes the act of sex in ecstatic, uplifting terms. Seeking to promote the cause of birth control among the wealthy and influential, she steered her movement away from the socialist movement. Sanger, a bourgeois feminist, was willing to make any political compromise she saw as necessary to win advocates to her side and thus embraced some ugly arguments popular among bourgeois reformers of the time, such as endorsing eugenics, including the call to bar immigration for the “feebleminded.” While the eugenics movement, which stigmatized the poor for their own oppression, was at the time not yet associated with the genocidal movement that would emerge in Nazi Germany, it was widely opposed by socialists. American socialist and birth control pioneer Antoinette Konikow denounced the presence of eugenicists at a 1921 New York City conference on birth control, declaring that the working-class mothers she represented “are often considered to be not fit” by such forces.

The “Population Bomb”

Behind the scenes (or not), people have always struggled to control fertility for their own private reasons. But there is also a longstanding chain of argument in favor of population control on the part of bourgeois ideologues. The most notorious of these was made by Church of England parson Thomas Malthus, whose 1798 Essay on the Principle of Population predicted unrelenting misery on account of population growth that would, he claimed, inevitably outstrip available resources. Writing at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Malthus proposed two solutions: leave the poor to die of their misery (he opposed poor relief) and postpone the age of marriage so as to reduce the number of children per couple (that is, “abstinence” as birth control).

Malthusianism was, as Friedrich Engels characterized it in The Condition of the Working-Class in England, “the most open declaration of war of the bourgeoisie upon the proletariat.” Lenin, too, denounced Malthusianism in a short 1913 article, “The Working Class and Neomalthusianism.” At the same time, he noted, “It goes without saying that this does not by any means prevent us from demanding the unconditional annulment of all laws against abortions or against the distribution of medical literature on contraceptive measures, etc.” Lenin called for “freedom for medical propaganda and the protection of the elementary democratic rights of citizens, men and women.”

The corollary of Malthusianism, eugenics, with its calls for compulsory sterilization and forced abortions, has its contemporary advocates, including Obama’s “science czar,” John Holdren. In 1977, Holdren co-authored Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment with the (now largely discredited) population “experts” Paul and Anne Ehrlich. Dripping with contempt, Holdren et al. wrote: “If some individuals contribute to general social deterioration by overproducing children…they can be required by law to exercise reproductive responsibility.” Such “reproductive responsibility” laws could include “compulsory abortion,” “adding a sterilant to drinking water or staple foods,” “sterilizing women after their second or third child” and other “involuntary fertility control” methods that would be implemented by a “Planetary Regime,” which “might be given responsibility for determining the optimum population for the world.” The ravings of Holdren and the Ehrlichs are worthy of the genocidal Nazi eugenics movement.

Marxists are of course not indifferent to the problem of rapid population growth. But our starting point is the fight for socialist revolution to open the widest vista of human freedom. As we wrote in part two of “Capitalism and Global Warming” (WV No. 966, 8 October):

“Only a society that can raise the standard of living worldwide can provide the conditions for a natural decline in reproductive rates….

“Under communism, human beings will have far greater mastery over their natural and social environments. Both the division between town and country and economic dependence on the family will be overcome. The time when people were compelled to have more children in order to ensure enough manpower to work the land or to care for the elderly will have long passed.”

Genesis of the Pill

Margaret Sanger first had the idea of a “magic pill” to prevent conception in 1912, but the scientific knowledge to create it did not exist. By the end of World War II, decades of research into human reproductive biology had revealed the crucial role of hormones in conception and pregnancy. In 1953 Sanger, accompanied by International Harvester heiress Katherine McCormick, paid a visit to the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, where Gregory Pincus, who in the 1930s engineered the first in vitro fertilization (a rabbit embryo), conducted his privately funded research. Pincus’s early work had been cited as a great scientific achievement, but the storm of media condemnation over “babies in test tubes” led to him being denied tenure by Harvard University and all but driven from mainstream research as a “mad scientist.” Another maverick scientist, chemist Russell Marker, had developed a technique, later refined by Carl Djerassi, to extract massive, cheap amounts of a synthetic progestin from a species of enormous yam that grew only in Mexico. The research to create an oral contraceptive was funded almost entirely out of McCormick’s private fortune; the pharmaceutical companies would not touch research into contraception at that time.

The post-World War II years were hard for American women. The outbreak of the Cold War, the purge of communists and other militants from the unions and the rise of McCarthyism also included a wholesale campaign to put women back into the kitchen and nursery. Many women had escaped from such drudgery during World War II, when their labor was necessary for the war economy. As the government investigated “subversives,” there was an unprecedented state intrusion into family life and the deadening of every aspect of social and intellectual life. A “normal” family and a vigilant mother were supposed to be the front line of defense against treason, while anti-Communists linked “deviant” family or sexual behavior to sedition. Most women were married by age 19; the birth rate became the highest in U.S. history.

At the same time, the groundbreaking reports by Alfred C. Kinsey documented what Americans really did behind the bedroom door (and in some other places, too). And women wanted better contraception. The Pill was first marketed in 1957 as a treatment for menstrual disorders. When word circulated that it suppressed ovulation and prevented pregnancy, doctors across the country were besieged by hundreds of thousands of women asking for prescriptions to treat their suddenly discovered menstrual problems.

The leap to respectability and mainstream medicine for the Pill came through Harvard gynecologist John Rock, a fertility specialist, who had the medical practice and experience in working with women patients that enabled the first clinical trials to be conducted. A devout Roman Catholic, Rock later wrote a book, The Time Has Come: A Catholic Doctor’s Proposals to End the Battle Over Birth Control, trying to garner public support in a fruitless campaign to make the Catholic church change its denunciation of birth control as a sin.

In its first incarnation, the Pill had doses of progesterone and estrogen far higher than it does today, leading to serious side effects in some users. These dangers were seized upon by anti-woman bigots, including in the Senate, which in 1970 held a series of hearings to “investigate” the matter. Over the years the Pill has been massively tested in many combinations. While risks remain regarding breast cancer and stroke for some, the Pill in fact helps to protect women from ovarian and uterine cancer. Because it reduces or eliminates the menstrual flow, it also reduces the risk of anemia, a serious problem in poor countries. The experience of millions of women, researchers and doctors working to improve the safety of the Pill has provided the basis for the clinical trials and testing now routinely used by the Food and Drug Administration.

From Carter to Reagan: Resurgence of the Religious Right

By 1960 the Pill was available by prescription as a contraceptive, but laws against contraception remained on the books in many states. Until 1965, it was illegal for married people in Connecticut to use birth control. Until 1972, it was illegal for single people to use birth control in Massachusetts and many other states as well. Bill Baird, a heroic fighter for women’s right to abortion and contraception, spent three months in jail in Massachusetts for giving a package of contraceptive foam and a condom to a Boston University student as a challenge to the law. His case later went to the Supreme Court and helped lay the basis for the right to privacy—the main legal argument behind Roe v. Wade, which established legal abortion in the United States in 1973.

The legalization of abortion was itself a product of the explosive struggles of the 1960s. For the American bourgeoisie, the all-sided social turmoil and defiance of authority of that period were deeply disturbing. U.S. imperialism was suffering a humiliating defeat at the hands of Vietnam’s heroic workers and peasants. In the late 1970s, a major bourgeois ideological assault was launched to overcome the “Vietnam syndrome”—popular hostility to direct U.S. military intervention abroad—and to instill an unquestioning acceptance of “free enterprise,” God and the family among the population, which included the desirability of dying for one’s country. Coming to office in 1977, the Democratic Carter administration brought “born again” religious fundamentalism front and center into the White House as it kicked off a renewal of U.S. imperialism’s Cold War drive to destroy the Soviet degenerated workers state, garbed in the call for “human rights.”

This was the backdrop for the decades-long anti-sex witchhunt against abortion rights, pornography, gay rights and teen sex as well as for the vicious persecution of AIDS patients and day-care workers, who were targeted and jailed as “child molesters” amid hysterical allegations of “satanic ritual abuse.” Beginning in the 1980s, scientific research into new contraceptive methods virtually screeched to a halt as Reagan slashed funding for family planning internationally, including for abortion and birth control, leaving many Third World women with not much to turn to. While Obama has reversed this particular policy, he explicitly disavowed defending the rights of women as well as immigrants in his health care proposal, proclaiming that “the reforms I’m proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally” and that “no federal dollars will be used to fund abortion, and federal conscience laws will remain in place.” Obama pledged to uphold the Hyde Amendment, which outlaws Medicaid funding for abortions.

For Women’s Liberation Through Socialist Revolution!

Birth control methods like the Pill, medical knowledge, understanding of women’s health—these things have indeed taken giant leaps forward in the last 50 years. But exploitation, poverty and religious and cultural strictures deprive most women on the planet of these benefits. For them, daily life is little more than that of a beast of burden. Across vast regions of the globe, in the backward neocolonial capitalist countries oppressed by imperialism, women are swathed in the veil, sold into marriage against their will, or subjected to barbaric punishments like death sentences for “adultery” in Saudi Arabia, Iran and elsewhere. Poverty and backwardness, buttressed by imperialist domination, mean that much of the basic infrastructure necessary to bring basic medical care, contraception and abortion to Third World women is simply not there. Some researchers estimate that in Latin America and the Caribbean the primary cause of death for women between the ages of 15 and 39 is complications from illegal abortions.

Feminism, a worldview counterposed to Marxism, is not capable of generating a program for the liberation of women. Feminism analyzes society as gender-based rather than class-based. It views anti-woman ideology as just bad thinking and puts forward that what is needed is to spread correct ideas and then maybe people will catch on and stop being bigots. Feminism is an anti-egalitarian ideology of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois women who support the capitalist system and seek their own power and privilege within it. Indeed, for women like Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama, the good life will only continue to get better. But for working-class, poor and minority women, jobs disappear, wages plummet and life only continues to get harder. The fundamental source of women’s oppression is not bad laws or male chauvinist attitudes—these are but reflections of the subordination of women in the institution of the family and the capitalist system that requires it.

The liberation of women can be realized only with the victory of proletarian revolution, which will smash all forms of social oppression, lay the material basis to free women from age-old family servitude and reorganize society in the interest of all. The family cannot simply be abolished; rather, its social functions like housework, child rearing, preparation of food, etc., must be replaced by social institutions. This perspective requires a tremendous leap in social development, which can be achieved only through sweeping away capitalist rule on a global basis and replacing it with a rational, democratically planned economy. The International Communist League fights to forge Leninist-Trotskyist parties throughout the world to lead the struggle for working-class power. Inscribed on the banners of these parties will be the struggle for women’s liberation, which is an integral part of the emancipating goals of communism. As we wrote in “In Defense of Science and Technology” (WV No. 843, 4 March 2005):

“Communism will elevate the standard of life for everyone to the highest possible level. By eliminating scarcity, poverty and want, communism will also eliminate the greatest driving force for the prevalence of religion and superstition—and the attendant backwardness, which defines the role of women as the producers of the next generation of working masses to be exploited.”

For women’s liberation through socialist revolution!

""In the fall, when Biden first requested supplemental funding to support Ukraine and Israel amid their respective conflicts, Johnson said he wanted to tie that money to changes in immigration policy.

For months, a group of bipartisan senators worked to hammer out a deal that they said would implement the most comprehensive immigration reforms in years. Even before the details of the deal were released, Johnson cast doubt on whether it would pass muster in the House. Shortly after the bill was unveiled, he deemed it ""dead on arrival"" in the House.

At the time, Johnson denied the characterization that he reversed course. He told ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott that the legislation was a ""nonstarter"" because it didn't contain, in his view, ""real border security reform.""

The Senate then moved ahead with a standalone $95 billion foreign aid bill, which passed early Tuesday morning. Twenty-two Senate Republicans joined Democrats in supporting the measure.""",2024-02-15T12:46:46+00:00

Nancy Pelosi suggested that Russia may be funding pro-Palestinian protesters who have been interrupting Democratic campaign events, saying that some calling for a ceasefire are promoting “Putin’s message.”

Protesters disrupted Pelosi’s appearance in Seattle on Thursday to call for an end to Israel‘s assault on Palestine. Vocal demonstrators have also been appearing regularly at President Joe Biden’s events. Pelosi said that she would like the FBI to investigate whether Russia is financing these groups.

Here's a report from November: 

> Attacks by Israel on targets within Gaza have destroyed or damaged 45 percent of all housing units in the Gaza strip, internally displaced about 1.5 million people and killed over 10,000 people, including over 80 UN staff. Over 25,000 people have been wounded in the airstrikes. Sixty-seven percent of all fatalities are reportedly children or women. More than 2,300 people – among them 1300 children are reported missing, most of them likely trapped under the rubble.

https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/11/gaza-destroying-civilian-housing-and-infrastructure-international-crime

Here's another: 

> About 1.7 million people - more than 80% of Gaza's population - are displaced, with nearly half crammed in the far southern end of the strip, according to the United Nations.

> Further analysis, by BBC Verify, reveals the scale of destruction of farmland, identifying multiple areas of extensive damage.

> The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it is targeting both Hamas fighters and ""terror infrastructure"", when challenged over the scale of damage.

> Now, satellite data analysis obtained by the BBC shows the true extent of the destruction. The analysis suggests between 144,000 and 175,000 buildings across the whole Gaza Strip have been damaged or destroyed. That's between 50% and 61% of Gaza's buildings.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68006607

Here's one from last month:

> Over 70 per cent of all housing units across the Gaza Strip have been destroyed, and that number climbs to over 80 per cent in the north.

> An independent UN expert on housing, Balakrishnan Rajagopal, told the Human Rights Council that the scale and intensity of destruction in Gaza “is far worse than in Aleppo, Mariupol or even Dresden and Rotterdam during World War Two.”

>The White House offered no details about how it would assess whether Israel complied with Biden’s demands and how U.S. policy could change if the administration determines Israel does not meet its demands.

From [an earlier Politico report](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/06/jared-kushner-trump-jerusalem-mideast-peace-283770).

>From Kushner’s perspective, according to people familiar with his thinking, **the hope was that the announcement would fulfill a long-standing promise but do little damage to the relationships he has forged with players in the Middle East**, like the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, widely referred to as “MBS.”

>**“I think [Trump] and Jared figure that** ***after all the posturing and a few days of riots, things go back to normal when it comes to the negotiations,”*** said a person close to the administration.

>Kushner also feels like he has the private backing of major players in the region. The close confidant who speaks to Kushner regularly said: “It'’s a bold, bold move. Jared and MBS are locked at the hip, and they are saying, 120 years of this hasn’t worked. Let’s take it in our hands.”

Everything will be fine after a few days of riots.

politics,comment,Peace process,dqvsi1u,Appaguchee,,"Trump is trying to get his Russian nuclear reactors built.

(https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1DV5Z6)

He was supposed to do it with dissolved Russian sanctions, but has been embroiled in Russian-collusion since the beginning of his election.

So now he declares Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Who benefits from such a move? Well, Russia, mostly, I'd say. That and big international US corporations. While the Jews and Muslims get back to their guerrilla/terrorist warfare, Israel gets its guns from US manufacturers, Islamic nations from Russia. They get back to arguing over whose god loves whom more. In the meantime, Russia finds a relatively conflict-free region of the Middle East, agrees with local leadership to provide weapons at a reduced price if they agree to buy a nuclear power plant. Russia provides nuclear power, the US (or US certain citizens' privately owned international firms) assists in providing materials, Trump argues Russia is humanitarian, sanctions drop as US and Russia bankroll enormous funds from local conflict and subsequent power sales at ""nominal"" prices to the local region. Where does the money go? Corrupt Russian leadership (Putin and cronies) and GOP superfund donors and finally, a super tiny percentage to Trump corporations, which installs hotels and charges nominal (cheap) fees for bigwigs to stay at his elite-level accomodations and negotiate how best to ""deal"" with the local infidel.

Why did Kushner go over there? Well, Putin and Russia is connected with the Islamic side, Kushner is the US' Isreali side, and Trump is the useful idiot to gap the two sides to ensure good control and management of the conflict as well as present a ""plausible deniability"" and innocent facade to the whole thing.

Putin plays Trump as the useful idiot he is. Putin, bigwig US CEOs laugh and share expensive drinks, and Trump feels he gets to be a big boy at the big boy table, ignoring the pity, disdain, and disrespect the Billionaire's Club Members show him.

> 
> In May 2017, the former president defended his actions after he was found to have discussed sensitive details about an alleged Islamic State [Isis] plot with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office. Trump said he had an absolute right to do so. The intel was said to have been provided to the U.S. from Israel.
> 
> It was suggested at the time that the former president's handing over sensitive information from Israel could have damaged the relationship between the two countries. It also could have raised the possibility that the details could be passed from Russia to Iran, the Gulf nation that is a fierce adversary of Israel and has long supported Hamas.
> 
> On Saturday, Hamas, designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and the European Union, launched a large-scale attack against Israel, resulting in the deadliest day of violence in the Israel-Palestine conflict for decades. More than 700 people have been killed in Israel, and a further 400 in Gaza, since the incursion by Hamas, according to the Associated Press.
> 
> On social media, a number of people believe that Trump's handing over of Israeli information may have resulted in Iran assisting the Palestinian group.
> 
> **Thom Hartmann, author and political commentator, posted on ~~X, formerly~~ Twitter, while sharing a 2017 article from The Washington Post: ""Hamas apparently knew how to get around Israel's Iron Dome defenses. They probably learned this from Iran. Iran almost certainly got the information from Russia. And who gave it to Russia? Sure looks like it was Donald Trump, at the request of Putin.""**
> 
> Allison Gill, who tweets using the account for the Mueller, She Wrote podcast, added: **""Don't forget: Trump gave Israeli intelligence to Russians in the Oval Office 6 years ago. Putin armed Iran in exchange for drones to attack Ukraine.""**
> 
> While sharing a link of its own reporting of Trump's handing over of sensitive materials, the Meidas Touch X account posted: **""FLASHBACK: Trump shared classified intelligence from Israel with Russia—and admitted to it. Israeli intelligence feared it would end up in the hands of Iran.""**
> 
> ""This isn't hard to follow,"" added musician and author Mikel Jollett. **""Trump gave military intel to the Russians. The Russians, who are extremely close allies with Iran, gave it to Iran. Iran gave that information to Hamas. Hamas used it to attack Israel. This is why intel security matters. Republicans DO NOT CARE.""**
> 
> Newsweek has contacted Trump's office for comment via email.
> 
> In an interview with CNN, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. has not found any evidence to suggest Iran is also behind the attacks.
> 
> ""We have not yet seen evidence that Iran directed or was behind this particular attack, but there is certainly a long relationship,"" Blinken added.
> 
> In 2017, Trump defended sharing sensitive intel with Russia at the White House (WH), saying it was necessary for security reasons.
> 
> ""As president, I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled WH meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety,"" Trump wrote. ""Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against Isis and terrorism.""

As a History major, I've had to do my fair share of research about the current Arab-Israeli conflict. As a human being I have a great deal of sympathy for the Palestinian CIVILIANS as well as Israelis whether they are Jewish, Christian, or Muslim.

To date, only 1 person has been sent to death in Israeli courts. His name was Adolf Eichmann and he was very much apart of the Nazi Party and Holocaust (6 million Jews and 6 million political opponents, Polish, Rhineland Bastards, Slavic, and homosexuals were killed in less than a decade). The Israeli military and Mossad have successfully defended (that's right IDF stands for Israeli Defense Forces) Israel since they were attacked after declaring independence. No armed forces or intelligence branch is perfect, and I'll be the first to admit that innocents have died unfairly from Israeli hands. I also am not a fan of the new settlements (they should be postponed for the sake of peace talks). I'm for the blockade seeing as weapons are being shipped through at alarming rates whenever such restrictions are lifted.

Moving on: i understand exactly where you are coming from because i have been fighting this exact same battle for quite sometime. You make all of your points clear, everything you stated is correct and yet people still find ways to argue. It really is sad. 

The problem is because, for whatever reason, people dont like jews, and israel, for being a jewish controlled country is seen as bad. 

You can keep trying to explain all these points. You can keep pointing out the obvious, but here ia the biggest problem: most people are fucking stupid. They easily believe shit that the biased media spoonfeeds them, and they are brainwashed into believing that israel is bad. 

It doesnt matter that israel is one of the usa's biggest allies. It doesnt matter that they are THE ONLY democracy in the middle east. It doesnt matter that they have the largest percentage of nobel prize winners, scientists, and intellectuals out of ANY country in the world.  Who gives a shit if israel invented tons of modern technology that everyone alive uses today, at home, schools, hospitals etc...Theyre bad. Because the news says so. 

No matter how many times you try to show the world the truth, they just wont listen. They have been brainwashed into believing that israel is bad and it is just unfourtunate. 

Hamas IS responsiblr for all that crap happening to the palestinians, but no one will believe it. They use awful tactics like shooting missiles from schools, so that when israel retaliates, and hits the locations that the missiles came from, boom its all over the news that the evil israelis bombed a palestinian school. Its really fucked up, but whats worse is that the news will never show you how hamas really doesnt give a shit about the people, because the ones in control dont have to die. They get to control everything. Their lives are just dandy. Why should they careabout the poor palestinians? And the other part of the problem? The poor palestinians have no idea whats going on. Hamas tells them its israel's fault, so the poor palestinians hate israel, go blow themselves up because hey, their lives suck. What have they got to lose? And even better for them, they get abunch of virgins up in heaven. Its such a pathetic system of lies yet it is unbelievable how people are just so fucking stupid to see through it all.

But I'm fairly confident that Netanyahu is doing all this to a) avoid legal issues in his country and b) to help divide the Left in America, weaken Biden's stance (though he's not doing himself any favors...), and he's probably working with Putin on this. They do have a relationship due to how many Russian Jews there are (plus they're both Fascists). Unfortunately, there's a lot of latent anti-Muslim hatred so whether or not a lot of other Israeli government officers are part of it, I'm not sure.

Nikita Khrushchev, premier of USSR (now Russia), from 1958-1964 is credited with this quotes:

""We do not have to invade the United States, we will destroy you from within.""

""The John Birch Society is Communism’s greatest ally. With its help we will divide and confuse the American people until they have lost faith in their Government, their nation has ceased to be a major world power, and their country is ripe for revolution.""

It seems this prophecy came to fruition with the 2016 Presidential election.

Further evidence came in the form of Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL), Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), Sen. John Thune (R-SD), Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), Sen. Jerry Moran (R-KS), Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND), Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Rep. Kay Granger (R-TX) visiting Russia on July 4th, 2018.

They met with Sergey Kislyak at this time — the guy that met secretly with numerous members of the Trump 2016 campaign, including disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Plus they met in a plenary session at the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) had a private meeting with Russian representatives plus said he ""was honored to deliver a letter from President Trump to Vladimir Putin's administration.""  This was three weeks after the Trump/Putin meeting in Helsinki, Finland.

Dr. Robert Paxton's definition from The Anatomy of Fascism:

>""A form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy and purity, in which a mass-based party of **committed nationalist militants**, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, **abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing** and external expansion."" (Emphasis added.)

Friendly reminder:

>""Trump was over a billion in debt and the Russians bailed him out.  
>  
>►  Trump was first compromised by the Russians in the 80s. In 1984, the  Russian Mafia began to use Trump real estate to launder money. In 1987,  the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for  Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to  Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after  his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO  calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign  policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as  laundering money for the Russian mob through Trump's real estate, but  evolved into something far bigger.  
>  
>►  In July 2008, the height of the housing bust, Trump sold a mansion in  Palm Beach for $95 million to Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian oligarch.  Trump had purchased it four years earlier for $41.35 million. The sale  price was nearly $54 million more than Trump had paid for the property.  Again, this was the height of the recession when all other property had  plummeted in value.  
>  
>►  So many Russians bought Trump apartments at his developments in Florida  that the area became known as Little Moscow. The developers of two of  his hotels were Russians with significant links to the Russian mob. The  late leader of that mob in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich  Ivankov, was living at Trump Tower  
>  
>►  According to a Bloomberg investigation (3/16/2017) into Trump World  Tower, “a third of units sold on floors 76 through 83 by 2004 involved  people or limited liability companies connected to Russia and  neighboring states.”  
>  
>►  In 2013, Federal agents busted an “ultraexclusive, high-stakes, illegal  poker ring” run by Russian gangsters out of Trump Tower. They operated  card games, illegal gambling websites, and a global sports book and  laundered more than $100 million. A condo directly below one owned by  Trump reportedly served as HQ for a “sophisticated money-laundering  scheme” connected to Semion Mogilevich.  
>  
>►  The Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. Russia is a  mafia state. that is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the  fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of  the United States is deeply disturbing.  
>  
>►  Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a  federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive. Now he's  deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani  appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990,  and the FBI described Kislin as having ties tot he Russian mob. Of  course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for  smashing the Italian mob.  
>  
>►  A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian  money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. The NRA got as much as $70M  from Russia, then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial  Campaign Committee lead by McConnel got millions from Leonard Blavatnik.  In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like  Speaker of the House Tom Delay. Unger's book alleges that most of the  GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money.  
>  
>►  At the Cityscape USA’s Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets  Conference held in Manhattan, on September 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Trump  Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family  business, saying ""...And in terms of high-end product influx into the  US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of  our assets.""  
>  
>►  Eric Trump told golf reporter James Dodson in 2014 that the Trump  Organization was able to expand during the financial crisis because “We  don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of  Russia.”  
>  
>► Russian oligarchs co-signed Trump’s Deutsche bank loans.  
>  
>Trump now gleefully takes cues from Putin:  
>  
>►  At the end of 2018, Putin and his allies started making a strong push  for a resolution that would justify their country’s 1979 invasion of  Afghanistan and reverse an 1989 vote backed by Mikhail Gorbachev that  condemned it. The Putinists’ goal was to pass the resolution by Feb.  There is no one on this side of the Atlantic who thinks the USSR was  justified in invading Afghanistan. And out of nowhere, on January 2nd,  Trump came out strongly supporting Russia's 1979 invasion of  Afghanistan.  
>  
>►  Trump went against American intelligence on North Korean missiles. He  told the FBI he didn't believe their intelligence because Putin told him  otherwise. ""I don't care, I believe Putin""  
>  
>►  Trump met in secret with Putin the G20 summit in November 2018, without  note takers. 19 days later, he announced a withdrawal from Syria. As a  note, Trump conducted FIVE completely private meetings and conferences  with Putin, and has gone to great lengths to prevent literally anyone,  even people in his administration, from learning what was discussed.  
>  
>►  Trump refused to enforce sanctions legally codified into law - and in  some cases reversed standing sanctions on Russian companies.  
>  
>►  He has denounced his own intelligence agencies in a press conference  with Putin on election meddling - and publicly endorsed Putin's version  of events.  
>  
>►  Trump pulled out of the INF treaty with no explanation, which allows  Putin to create long-range hypersonic missiles that threaten Europe with  impunity. The US already has all the weaponry that the INF would ban  the development of, so this offers us literally nothing, while allowing  Russia to develop powerful new weapons to challenge our allies.  
>  
>► Demanded Russia get invited back into G7  
>  
>► Pushed the CIA to give American intelligence to the Kremlin.  
>  
>► Withdrew from the Open Skies treaty  
>  
>►  Received intelligence in 2019 that Russia was paying bounties for dead  American soldiers, and hasn't done anything about it by the time of this  writing.  
>  
>►  Announced troop withdrawal from Germany (America's missile defense from  Russia and forward operating base against Russian aggression)  
>  
>►  And of course, Trump continues to threaten to pull out of NATO, a move  so catastrophically stupid, so inconceivably cosmically myopic, I truly  can't express the profundity of the idiocy. Suffice to say, pulling out  of NATO would be like the only guy in a prison yard with a shotgun just  throwing it over the fence for absolutely no reason, suddenly giving the  people with crude homemade shivs complete power.""

politics,comment,Occupation,fyqq0yq,Royal_Ambition,,"Vote. vote.

Every two years you have Americans asking ""what can we do"" and every two years just over 50% of eligible voters bother to vote.

Vote.  Vote.  Vote.

Not just at a federal level, not just at a state level, but even at a local level.  Judges, mayors, city council.

No one is going to save you.  No candidate is going to sprout up and be the hero you need to save the day.  No prosecutor is going to hunt down the bad guys and eradicate evil.  No team of investigators are going to suddenly unearth the eureka moment that will bring this all down around its ears.

It is a slow process of gradual change.  Get it started already.

Vote.

 Edit:

America: ""How do we solve our societal problems?""

""Vote.""

America: ""Nah.""

Seems like America's problem isn't corruption but cynicism.  How embarrassing to be sitting there with your country on fire, 200+ millions of people holding buckets of water in their hands, saying ""but it's just one bucket, it won't make a difference"" and watching them spill it down the drain.

The craziest part is that so many replies to me say ""you're naive! this doesn't work!"" but ignore the fact that it's literally proven to work.  The radical and evangelical right are a minority in America and they have slowly and gradually shifted control and power to their ideals by just consistently voting, over and over.  They've done it in less than 20 years.

You have all the proof you need that it works, you just won't accept it because it means you won't have an excuse for your inaction anymore.  You won't have someone to blame except yourself for what's happened.

Every cycle you vote, you will start to see more and more representation that appeals to what voters want (that isn't optimism, that's the fundamentals of the job).  It won't happen at once, it'll happen gradually, inch by inch.  No not every candidate will be perfect, yes some will break their promises.  It happens: grow up and get over it.  Keep voting, keep being politically active, stay a threat and a weight hanging over the heads of those who need you to keep their job.

Little by little you'll start to see the gridlock easing.  Candidates pushing for changes in bylaws and finance reforms, changes to campaign funding and political interference, changes to not just the social infrastructure but the political one.  Pushback and laws against electoral rigging, gerrymandering, voter suppression, better and better and better representation.  You'll see candidates who better represent your views, are more active and aggressive in pushing the change you want, more accountable to public response.

No you're not going to vote in a hero to save the fucking day, what you're going to do is shape the job.  Set the standard higher and higher for those who apply, and keep them more accountable.  Until one day you realize that you're not picking the better of two evils, that you have a genuine choice.

Do that, or do nothing.  Masturbate with your cynicism, telling yourself your inaction is justified, that the perfect and most immediate solution does not exist so nothing should be done, that it's too much work or too slow.  Fail yourself, your neighbours, your country, and its future the same way the people before did you.  Keep the cycle of civil inaction going and all your self-pity fulfilling its own prophecies to make you feel ""right"".  Keep being a coward.  Keep waiting for a populace that is too stupid to wear masks during a pandemic to somehow navigate a sudden, complicated, political revolution.

No, voting is not the only solution.  No, voting is not the perfect solution.  But it's the difference between why every other first world country has its shit together and why you're still a mess.



ALSO, are we not going to talk about how hard it is to vote in America? From certain areas being purposefully sent either broken or malfunctioning polling equipment, long lines that dissuade people from voting because ya know it's not a national holiday. Voter suppression is real and just telling people to vote when there is an active movement to make it harder is crazy. I believe people should vote definitely but we have to recognize the reality of how hard it really is to do so here.


people so worked up they don't vote.  We end up suppressing ourselves.

Here's the big takeaway: Make a plan to vote, now.  Learn the voting options in your state, make sure you're registered, and decide how to make it easy.  Roughly speaking:

Voting by mail: If your state will let you have a mail-in ballot, make sure you have a plan to send it in as soon as it arrives.  Ten states have ballot drop-boxes (Arizona, California, Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington), which let you get your ballot in right away.  If you have to send it back through the mail, don't waste time - cast your votes, sign the envelope, and drop it in the mail the same day you receive it!

Voting in person: While the wild fantasies of spooks abducting you at the polls are pretty damn unlikely, if you're worried, VOTE EARLY.  Thirty-nine states let you do it, and there are much smaller lines.  Also a good way to avoid COVID (but definitely wear a mask!)  If you have to vote on Election Day, don't worry about abductions; worry about the fact you may be in a multi-hour line.  Book the day off in advance, bring snacks, charge your phone, bring a book, have an umbrella if you live somewhere hot...think of all the little things.

Make sure you know your state's requirements, and don't forget yours!  If you don't have a needed ID, VoteRiders can help you out).

This election is too important to leave up to chance.  Make your voting plan now, carry it out, and make sure you send the GOP packing!  We can do it if we all do our part!

And if you want to go a step further and help others vote?  Come by r/VoteDEM and volunteer for Democratic candidates!",2020-07-21T06:32:23+00:00

There are so many directions this discussion could lead, but in the end the most important question seems to be whether or not Iran has violated their part of the Joint Comprehensive plan of action. [The text of the JCPA can be found here](https://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/iran/jcpoa/).

>A former senior Israeli intelligence official said the documents were significant because they revealed that Iran’s nuclear program “was a far larger project” than anyone knew, and proved that the Iranians were “on a clear path to the bomb.” The official said that while **none of the documents were currently operational**, they provided a sort of lending library for future generations of Iranians who might want to build a nuclear weapon when restrictions in the agreement expire.

>In the report, the Agency assessed that, before the end of 2003, an organizational structure was in place in Iran suitable for the coordination of a range of activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device.

The Agency’s overall assessment was that a range of activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device were conducted in Iran prior to the end of 2003 as a coordinated effort, and some activities took place after 2003. The Agency also assessed that these activities did not advance beyond feasibility and scientific studies, and the acquisition of certain relevant technical competences and capabilities. The same report stated that **the Agency had no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009**. Based on the Director General’s report, the Board of Governors declared that its consideration of this **issue was closed**.

NeutralPolitics,comment,Israel,dyah0jn,B0h1c4,,"Watching his presentation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qBt4tSCALA , it doesn't appear that he is trying to provide proof that the deal has been breached.  It appears that his focus is that 1.the Iran nuclear deal was based on false pretenses, and 2.that the deal didn't address key components that are critical to disarming an Iran nuclear program.

1.He provides evidence (assuming the documents are real) that Iran was actively working on a nuclear weapons program despite their claims that they never did. And documents showing that they would officially cancel the program and continue the work in secret. Iran was supposed to destroy any weapons materials and instead archived them to be used in the future.

2.The deal allowed them to continue operating their weapons facility  (the one under the mountain).  It permits them to continue development of longer range ICBMs that are capable of carrying a nuclear payload. And it allows them to enrich uranium that could then (not permitted by the deal) be weaponized if they would decide to restart their weapons program.


His case that Iran lied about developing nuclear weapons seems pretty strong.  And it also seems pretty strong that Iran failed to destroy any weapons research (that is where they got this information).


It looks like the *claim* is that Iran's plan was to shelve their nuclear weapon research, and focus on enrichment while simultaneously developing delivery devices.  Then at some point in the future, when those two components were secured, they could back out of the nuclear deal (or secretly violate it) and resume their nuclear weapons program. 

Assuming that the nuclear archives were the only copies of this information, and is now in Israeli hands, it would appear that they would essentially be back at square one if they resumed this program.


So to the question ""Does this presentation show that Iran violated the nuclear deal?"", it looks like they didn't necessarily violate it by resuming their weapons program, but that the deal was based on untruths from them.  I think the presentation makes a compelling case that they went into the program intending to resume this program at some point.

One key point is that he makes the claim that this program is still being funded by a secret program.  But he doesn't show any evidence of that.  The rest of the information puts the deal on shaky ground, but if they could substantiate the claim that it is still being worked on, then that would blow the deal out of the water.  But it doesn't appear that they have that evidence at this point. ",2018-05-01T21:39:47+00:00

Members of the administration fed sensitive information to House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes in the middle of the night.

This seems to imply that Egypt is limiting aid to 20 trucks per day, while Israel wants to allow unlimited aid via the Egyptian border.

On the other hand, [this October 21 article in the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/21/israel-hamas-war-aid-trucks-enter-gaza-egypt-rafah-border-crossing-opens) reads: ""The Rafah crossing point between Egypt and Gaza has finally opened to allow in a trickle of aid for the first time in two weeks, after intense negotiations involving the US, Israel, Egypt and the UN... Under the US-brokered agreement, only 20 trucks are being allowed in on Saturday, deliveries from the Egyptian Red Crescent to the Palestinian Red Crescent organisation.""

I think the Economist is a great source in general, but I am guessing they are referring to Biden's quote https://edition.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-news-hamas-war-10-18-23/h_e4fc21b3a3c82bcfdc753643ad2bf472

If that's the case, there is no mention of 20 per day, just 20 period. 

And video of Biden's comments: https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1714762800189624688

Biden also mentioned a first tranche, a possible second tranche, 150 trucks total, and that things would be stopped if Hamas took any aid. So no mention of 20 per day. And The Economist should have pointed to a source.

I tried to find more source(s) around this. I found an article that said the Egyption president said in a speech that 20 trucks/day is not enough:

> A convoy of 20 trucks a day in the Gaza Strip ""is not enough and we need more aid"". The president of Egypt said this today, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, in a speech at Egypt's annual Industrial Forum

Google did not have any other results for the quoted text, but that might be because it was translated (and translations are not always consistent). https://www.agenzianova.com/en/news/Egyptian-President-Al-Sisi%27s-warning%3A-Only-20-trucks-a-day-in-Gaza-are-not-enough/ seems to be the only source.

You posted a 2019 link about tunnels being closed. This is misleading. Egypt did not magically close all tunnels and Hamas did not magically stop building them. They had to do the same in 2013. If they had to do it twice in 6 years, why would those tunnels not have been rebuilt and remade by 2023?

After all, they were still finding them [in 2021 too](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-factions-accuse-egypt-of-pumping-toxic-gas-into-tunnel-killing-3-reports/).

That aside, [Israel itself said](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-said-to-bomb-rafah-crossing-to-egypt-after-telling-gazans-to-flee-through-it/) that there were tunnels in the area. Unfortunately, Egypt is not a liberal democracy and does not exactly allow journalists free rein. Nevertheless, Israel provided warnings to evacuate nearby areas beforehand, including the crossing.

Egypt is not going to let trucks drive through the Rafah Crossing which Israel is bombing (the Rafah Crossing is not just the actual gate, it is the area). Any errant bomb hitting any of the convoys will create a tense situation, especially on domestic side. The first video shows how close a bomb fell close to civilians. The errant tank hit on a border post already inflamed the situation even if it was quickly hushed away by both governments.

[Hamas was elected to the parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_legislative_election,_2006#List_of_Change_and_Reform), mostly representing Gaza. After the election, this lead to a split where two separate governments would govern either the West Bank or Gaza. Through the agreements, Fatah exercises control over the West Bank (where most of their support resides) and Hamas controls Gaza (where most of their support resides.) [Also following the split, the United States tried launching a coup in Gaza by arming Fatah fighters](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/04/gaza200804) in order to help Abbas (leader of Fatah) consolidate control over Gaza. The coup attempt was unsuccessful and Hamas reasserted its military authority over Gaza.

It's important to note that during the 2006 elections, the United States, through USAID, spent money on beautification projects in Palestine to help Fatah win, as well. There's the sense that Fatah is in bed with the United States because of these events.

[Hamas maintains control because they are viewed, by Gazans, as a legitimate military force resisting Israel.](https://news.vice.com/article/palestinian-support-for-hamas-soars-after-israel-war-as-fatah-loses-backing) Everytime they get into a war with Israel, their polling goes up. [They also spend a lot money on rebuilding infrastructure and providing social services.](http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/02/world/fg-charity2)

>Further why does the international community stand for this

They don't, but they can't do anything about it. The United States already tried to overthrow Hamas by using Fatah (see above) and it backfired immensely.

> and why would Israel not just gain control of the area and help the PNA restablish control.

1.) Because it's illegal for Israel to unilaterally invade Palestine without cause. Simply Hamas being the head of the government in Gaza is not cause for them to invade. They already tried using that as an excuse for their blockade, which itself was considered illegal by the UN. That aside, [they already have an illegal occupation in West Bank.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-must-end-its-50-year-occupation-of-palestine-the-white-house-says-10129448.html) And, again, their [blockade of Gaza was illegal, as well](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/un-independent-panel-rules-israel-blockade-of-gaza-illegal-1.384267). If Israel wants to further alienate themselves from the international community, then they could do this. Otherwise, they can't. Even Bibi, one of the most revanchist Israeli PMs in recent memory, probably knows that this would be stupid to do.

2.) If Israel does invade Gaza, they won't do it to help the Palestinian Authority establish control. They're going to do it to exert their own control over the land and people, more so than they try to do now. Again, look at the illegal occupation of the West Bank. That's not there to help the PA stay in control -- that's in there to help Israel stay in control.

>At this point it seems that would be Israel's best option as opposed to a blockade.

...no. The blockade was roundly considered to be illegal and they caught a lot of shit for it from the UN and from Obama's White House. If they actually went in and invaded Gaza to overthrow Hamas themselves, it would be one of the biggest and deadliest shitstorms we've seen in this larger shitstorm yet. Not even Fatah would go along with it, even if Israel was doing it to get them into power, because Fatah would completely lose whatever credibility they have left.",2016-05-26T22:40:25+00:00

>A nation born by the UN must live by the UN. Since Israel’s creation, the United Nations has passed at least 42 Resolutions against Israel for violating international law — 17 of which were passed before Hamas existed. These include resolutions condemning Israel for illegal practices against civilians in Lebanon, condemning Israel’s contravention of the Fourth Geneva Convention, calling on Israel to withdraw from all Palestinian territories, calling on Israel to recognize the Palestinian right of return, and calling on Israel to respect Muslim holy places. Post-Hamas, the UN has passed Resolutions against Israel to abide by and accept the Fourth Geneva convention, condemning Israel’s invasion of Lebanon, condemning Israel’s killing of UN employees of the World Food Program, and condemning Israel settlements established since 1967 as illegal — all of which have nothing to do with Hamas. This further establishes point two above that Hamas is not the root cause of this conflict. Unfortunately and remarkably, Israel has asked and the United States has agreed to veto all 42 of these UN Resolutions.

Israel is often under threat from various state and non-state actors in the Middle East. Historically, Israel has been involved in several wars in the region (see the Six Days War or the Yom Kippur War) and various groups (Hezbollah, Hamas, Iran) often posture themselves as anti-Israel to drum up support. Whether these groups have the ability or the actual will to threaten the existence of Israel is up for debate, but the United States has historically taken the posture that Israel needs to have the ability (both materially and diplomatically) to vigorously defend itself from  attack to preempt any aggression.

This decision seemingly came out of nowhere, and I have a fairly limited understanding of what this means for the middle east. Could anybody please provide some clarity on this in context to what it means for the future of the middle eastern political landscape

To summarize, I have a 2 main questions:

- What are the factors that led to this decision?
- What are the political implications of this decision?",2017-12-06T18:07:49+00:00
NeutralPolitics,comment,Jerusalem,dqv90pe,tasunder,,"It did not come out of nowhere.  This was a campaign promise and the repercussions were discussed a bit in 2016, per [this Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/09/israel-donald-trump-netanyahu-jerusalem).

> Israeli government ministers and political figures are pushing the US president-elect, Donald Trump, to quickly fulfill his campaign promise to overturn decades of US foreign policy and recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv.

> Their calls came as one of Trump’s advisers on Israel and the Middle East, David Friedman, told the Jerusalem Post that Trump would follow through on his promise.

> ‘It was a campaign promise and there is every intention to keep it,” Friedman said. ‘We are going to see a very different relationship between America and Israel in a positive way.”

Additionally, the timing is related to a semi-annual deadline to extend a waiver to move the embassy to Jerusalem.  The waiver is required in order to delay a [1995 law requiring that the Embassy move](https://www.congress.gov/104/plaws/publ45/PLAW-104publ45.pdf).  

The move was hinted at in news sources such as [Washington Post last week](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-trump-administration-debate-over-declaring-jerusalem-to-be-israels-capital/2017/12/01/4a02852c-d6b5-11e7-95bf-df7c19270879_story.html):

> Some of President Trump’s senior national security aides convened at the White House on Monday for what was expected to be an uncomfortable but straightforward discussion.

> On the table was how the administration would handle an upcoming deadline to say whether it would again defer its promise to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The expectation of many participants going into the session, according to officials and others familiar with the discussion, was that the White House would once again put off the move but issue a statement that Trump is keeping his campaign promise because the embassy move was a question of when, not if — a familiar talking point from the administration.

> Then Trump showed up.

> [...]

> The result of the meeting was a proposal, still under discussion, to issue a waiver but make a formal declaration that the United States considers Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital, officials said.

However, it does seem to be a bit of a reversal, perhaps of [statements in October](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-israel-trump/trump-says-giving-peace-a-chance-before-u-s-embassy-move-to-jerusalem-interview-idUSKBN1CD00R):

> In an interview with former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee on the TBN program “Huckabee,” Trump noted his administration was working on a plan for peace between the two sides.

> “I want to give that a shot before I even think about moving the embassy to Jerusalem,” he said.

> “If we can make peace between the Palestinians and Israel, I think it’ll lead to ultimately peace in the Middle East, which has to happen,” he said.

----

As a side note about the 1995 law linked above, although the law explicitly recognizes Jerusalem as the capitol, Congress does not have the authority to make that decision, and that authority is exclusively that of the President, per the Supreme Court's decision in [Zivotofsky v Kerry](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-628_3dq3.pdf):

> *Held*

>  1. The President has the exclusive power to grant formal recognition
to a foreign sovereign.
[...]
>  2. Because the power to recognize foreign states resides in the
President alone, §214(d) infringes on the Executive’s consistent decision
to withhold recognition with respect to Jerusalem. ",2017-12-06T20:44:35+00:00

The spokesman cited a 1980 United Nations Security Council resolution, which declared that any Israeli actions that ""have altered or purport to alter the character and status"" of Jerusalem constitute ""a serious obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.""

However, the number of *deaths* attributable to conflict is a bit different.

1. Intrastate and interstate conflicts are both down from historical levels, but we are in an uptick.
2. Conflict deaths are way up due to the scale of the conflicts.
3. These numbers do not include any conflicts in 2023, although these are mostly small scale outside of Ukraine. Myanmar has also had a non-insignificant number of conflict deaths this year, but not on the scale of the others. Depending on how the Myanmar conflict, Sudan conflict, and Israel-Hamas conflict develop, they also may be major contributors this year.",2023-11-07T10:48:05+00:00

Is it possible that Duterte's war on drugs was part of a large scale operation to crack down on and kill large amounts of small time drug dealers so the larger operations wouldn't have any competition?

Meth is a drug that [can be made by small operations](https://science.howstuffworks.com/meth3.htm)

> Small meth labs can be found in suburban houses, motel rooms, car trunks, in campsites or in the woods. Outdoor operations often result in water contamination and a dying-off of nearby vegetation

And [this source too](https://www.recovery.org/topics/history-methamphetamine-meth/)

> Small toxic labs (STLs) refer to the “mom-and-pop” operations where meth is produced cheaply and easily. In fact, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimates that, with just about $100 of raw materials, a meth cook can produce up to $1,000 worth of the substance in just a few hours. Because of this, there are probably thousands of these local operations spread around the country.

Seems plausible that a gross order to take out small time meth operations could result in a large amount of STLs being taken down, while keeping the larger organizations out of the line of fire.",2018-12-03T20:26:06+00:00

President Obama has made the argument that the only reason Syria has even approached this negotiation is because of the very real threat of US military intervention.

NeutralPolitics,comment,Ceasefire,cc6z00w,ajehals,,">If the US wasn't a legitimate threat, why would Assad consider any deals? 

The problem is that the US wasn't really a legitimate threat, the US (and the UK) already faced major problems domestically with any military action and frankly the US continues to arm the rebels (which is probably a more direct threat) and organises the arming and support of other fighters in the area.  What Assad is trying to do is make the case that he is the good guy and that the US is being overly aggressive,  so far that seems to be working and is broadly accurate.  

The problem I think is that people have started framing this in the context of chemical weapons, which frankly is absurd.  This isn't about chemical weapons, this is about an excuse to strike directly at the Government - after all the US has been pursuing an aggressive and interventionist approach (albeit an indirect one) for a very long time when it comes to Syria.  I would also add that if you read through the various documents that have come out of the UN, there have been suggestions of chemical weapons usage by both sides on a small scale from well before August - yet we didn't see any real push to deal with that until the US felt it could claim a regime led atrocity.  I suppose the question is why the US continues to arm rebel groups that may be implicated in the small scale use of CW and whether it would take action if they were shown to have used them, or were to use them on a larger scale.

The Russian initiative is one aimed at de-escalation, which broadly is the right way to go, the US continues to push for escalation and it isn't really working as a counterpoint to the Russian position (a stick to go with the carrot..) because it is coming across as incredibly illegitimate.

**My question is the following: How and why did Afghanistan become an American concern? Why does it remain an American concern? And how does it affect American foreign policy?**",2018-10-24T12:59:00+00:00
NeutralPolitics,comment,Peace process,e8eeg27,None,,"The US entered Aghanistan in October 2001, after the 9/11 attacks. The objective was to find Osama bin Laden who was the central figure of the terrorist group, al-Qaida, that was linked to the attackers. al-Qaida was operating in Afghanistan and being protected by Afghanistans's ""government"", the Taliban. The Taliban were extremely oppressive toward women, and liberating women was stated as a secondary objective of the war. [1](http://www.airuniversity.af.mil/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-12_Issue-1/Salt.pdf)

The Taliban offered to give bin Laden up for trial in a third country [2](https://web.archive.org/web/20130628053351/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/17/afghanistan.terrorism11). The US refused this offer and attacked. The Taliban government fell in December 2001, but the fighting continued as Afghanistan has been ravaged by war for centuries without any outside empire being able to control it since the 1700s (and that wasn't for a lack of trying, as the UK and Russia can attest). Ten years later the US claimed to have found bin Laden in a villa in Pakistan, where he was killed without trial and his body dumped in the ocean [3](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-13256676).

So the primary objective of rooting out the leaders of the 9/11 attacks through the war in Afghanistan failed. The secondary objective of helping the women of Afghanistan failed. While most of the world understood the US's reasons for invading Afghanistan, many even supporting the sentiment at the time and contributing neutral forces to help keep Afghanistan from falling into complete chaos, the sympathy was quickly overshadowed by the US's invasion of Iraq in 2003. After that, practically all international support was lost.

To clarify, the world opposed the war in Iraq to begin with. The fact that the US not only lost the war, but left the field open for one of the most brutal and destructive regimes in modern history has all but completely exhausted the patience of the US's closest allies in Europe.

If the US were to withdraw forces from Afghanistan now, there are three things that could happen.

* The Taliban could fall into civil war with what used to be the Northern Alliance, just as it was in the 1990s.  That is, Afghanistan could ""go back to normal."" This is the best-case scenario for the US.

* Mercenaries backed by Saudis or other rich Arabs could take over the power vacuum, essentially giving power to al-Qaida, ISIS or worse. The international community is terrified of this outcome, which would be a huge blow to US's reputation, especially considering what happened in Iraq.

* Worst of all and perhaps most likely, influence would be given up to Russia and Iran and to a lesser extent China and India. Russia and Iran are playing a very active role in rebuilding Afghanistan, and have close cultural and linguistic ties to the people of Afghanistan. Arguably, this would be much worse geopolitically for the US than the Taliban coming back to power, which is unlikely, or the country falling into complete chaos which is quite likely but not certain. Both Russia and Iran have competent militaries that could continue where the US leaves off, and unlike the US these countries have no prestige that compels them to unilaterally ""win"" the war, so they don't need Afghanistan to end up as a liberal democracy, and more importantly they can divide responsibilities between them.

US foreign policy is completely bound up by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. A substantial portion of the offensive military capacity and logistics is busy in these wars, and there is no readiness to start new invasions while the war in Afghanistan is still going on, even with the war in Iraq being all but abandoned. Given these wars, the Iraq war in particular, the US has isolated itself diplomatically. The world hoped that this would be repaired by Obama, which didn't happen given how the ending of the Iraq war was handled, and even if that could be forgiven diplomatic relations are now being completely stomped on by Trump.

Trump is frustrated because he recognizes that Afghanistan is a huge drain on capacity and money while giving nothing tangible in return. Domestically, the US are sick and tired of war. The tools that Trump is left with is heavy-handed diplomacy, shredding old contracts and demanding new ones to assert America's dominance and greatness.

This non-militaristic mode has already done a great deal to damage the US's standing in the world. Europe is abandoning the US dollar for its trade with Iran [4](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/eu-china-and-russia-in-move-to-sidestep-us-sanctions-on-iran), and India is following suit. These changes are just happening, but it is reasonable to suppose that a substantial number of nations, China, India and Russia included, could switch to the Euro for trade in the coming decade.

To compensate, the US is looking to Saudi Arabia as a springboard for projecting power and controlling the world's hydrocarbon trade. While Saudi Arabia is highly stable and powerful as a US ally, this is highly problematic for a number of reasons which I will not elaborate on now.

NeutralPolitics,comment,Peace process,e8doxxe,RajaRajaC,,"I am going to do an ELI5 version. Anything longer and I would need to write a 200,000k word paper on this topic and still not even scratch the surface. 

We go back to Egypt in 1928 and the founding of a very influential, pan Arab nationalist organisation called the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) by a Sunni Muslim named Hasan Al Bana. It broadly believed and continues to believe to this day that,

* Western cultural influences are evil,
* Western imperialism in the Muslim world (Arab world really) is preventing a glorious unification of all Arabs under Islam
* Sharia law is supreme and Islam is the first and only authority on all things concerning humans on Earth. 

Banna explicitly wanted to chase out the French, Americans and British from the middle East and create a caliphate stretching from North Africa to Indonesia, united under Sunni Islam. Ring a bell? If not, it will in a couple of minutes. 

In the mid 50's, President Nazer of Egypt organised a massive crackdown on MB and 1,000's of MB members fled to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait. 

Now these were almost entirely illiterate countries but had massive and a rapidly expanding oil wealth. The MB members were all highly literate (both on secular education and Islamic philosophy and theology). This was a match made in heaven and the royal families of these states funded a massive education program but the ideology and the actual teaching was done by MB members. 

In the late 70's the US and Saudis signed the 
*Military Training Mission Treaty*. This basically allowed a very small number of US advisors to be stationed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) as trainers to the KSA military. This stayed till  Gulf War 1 when America massively expanded it's military presence in the Kingdom. 

Now post the war the US military didn't just vacate entirely but had a much larger presence (ostensibly to enforce the no fly zone restrictions against Saddam's Iraq). This numbered around 5k active duty military personnel, mostly in and around the air Base at Dharhan. 

Starting the early 50's, America had been steadily intervening in the affairs of Iran, Palestine, Turkey, KSA, Jordan, Egypt (incl pushing for the crackdown that saw the 1,000's of MB men flee Egypt) amongst other states and this deeply affected the MB and other pan Arab ideologues who saw this as an assault on their ways. 

The Soviets invaded Afghanistan and US saw this as a chance to exact revenge for Vietnam. The US Senate though really didn't want to allocate a lot of money (initially) to this effort so the CIA, GID (KSA intelligence) and ISI (Pakistani intelligence) worked out a formula. America contributes half, GID matches it and ISI is the conduit to the Mujahideen. This worked but Afghanistan was awash with guns and easy money. When the Soviets were defeated the US lost all interest. The ISI And GID funded a hardcore Deobandi Sunni group called The Taliban against the Northern Alliance funded by Iran, India and Russia. The Taliban won because of the sheer money power it had. 

The taliban made the MB look tame by comparison. They not only wanted Sharia law but wanted to go back in time to a time when Islam was pure (hence the attack on everything from radios to cinema). They also needed money to run their govt and allowed any wannabe Jihadi a base as long as they were Sunni Muslim and paid up their dues. .

Enter Osama. Now Osama's mentor, advisor and personal physician, Ayman Zawahiri was an Egyptian and had joined the MB at age 12 iirc. He was a very devout MB follower. His own advisor and  friend, Ahmed Khadar was another Egyptian who while not having any ties with the MB had very similar thoughts (khadr was never a violent person though and mostly just funded charities, but his ideas were the same as Zawahiri). 

Around the late 80's, after the Soviets fled, a rich Saudi Scion named Osama who had a very minor role in the Jihad against the Soviets met these two men and started getting influenced by them. They had the thoughts, he had the money. That man? Osama Bin Laden. 

The ISI negotiated with the Taliban and gave him space and sanctuary as long as he funded (and gave volunteers) for the Pakistani operations in Kashmir. 

This is when gulf war happens (and the first falling out between the MB and KSA. MB wanted not a single US soldier in the ME and wanted the Arabs to resolve this conflict internally, the KSA thought otherwise) and OBL also fell out of favor with both his family and the Royal Saud dynasty. By now he was deeply influenced by Zawahiri and Kader. He was in other words influenced by the MB ideas. 

9/11 was a manifesto of those. He wanted the Americans out of the middle East, esp KSA. He wanted the Arabs to unite under Sunni Islam (sort of like MA*Arabs*GA) and as the US wasn't listening he figured a bold and audacious strike on US soil would get the civilians to pressure their govt to withdrawing from the KSA and ME in general.

We go back to Egypt in 1928 and the founding of a very influential, pan Arab nationalist organisation called the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) by a Sunni Muslim named Hasan Al Bana. It broadly believed and continues to believe to this day that,

* Western cultural influences are evil,
* Western imperialism in the Muslim world (Arab world really) is preventing a glorious unification of all Arabs under Islam
* Sharia law is supreme and Islam is the first and only authority on all things concerning humans on Earth. 

Banna explicitly wanted to chase out the French, Americans and British from the middle East and create a caliphate stretching from North Africa to Indonesia, united under Sunni Islam. Ring a bell? If not, it will in a couple of minutes. 

In the mid 50's, President Nazer of Egypt organised a massive crackdown on MB and 1,000's of MB members fled to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait. 

Now these were almost entirely illiterate countries but had massive and a rapidly expanding oil wealth. The MB members were all highly literate (both on secular education and Islamic philosophy and theology). This was a match made in heaven and the royal families of these states funded a massive education program but the ideology and the actual teaching was done by MB members. 

In the late 70's the US and Saudis signed the 
*Military Training Mission Treaty*. This basically allowed a very small number of US advisors to be stationed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) as trainers to the KSA military. This stayed till  Gulf War 1 when America massively expanded it's military presence in the Kingdom. 

Now post the war the US military didn't just vacate entirely but had a much larger presence (ostensibly to enforce the no fly zone restrictions against Saddam's Iraq). This numbered around 5k active duty military personnel, mostly in and around the air Base at Dharhan. 

Starting the early 50's, America had been steadily intervening in the affairs of Iran, Palestine, Turkey, KSA, Jordan, Egypt (incl pushing for the crackdown that saw the 1,000's of MB men flee Egypt) amongst other states and this deeply affected the MB and other pan Arab ideologues who saw this as an assault on their ways. 

The Soviets invaded Afghanistan and US saw this as a chance to exact revenge for Vietnam. The US Senate though really didn't want to allocate a lot of money (initially) to this effort so the CIA, GID (KSA intelligence) and ISI (Pakistani intelligence) worked out a formula. America contributes half, GID matches it and ISI is the conduit to the Mujahideen. This worked but Afghanistan was awash with guns and easy money. When the Soviets were defeated the US lost all interest. The ISI And GID funded a hardcore Deobandi Sunni group called The Taliban against the Northern Alliance funded by Iran, India and Russia. The Taliban won because of the sheer money power it had. 

The taliban made the MB look tame by comparison. They not only wanted Sharia law but wanted to go back in time to a time when Islam was pure (hence the attack on everything from radios to cinema). They also needed money to run their govt and allowed any wannabe Jihadi a base as long as they were Sunni Muslim and paid up their dues. .

The Taliban was the main government and had farmed and exported massive fields of opium poppies which to this day is still the number one exporter.

[America 'invaded'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror) on the false pretenses of: Osama bin Laden both being responsible for the attacks, and being in Afghanistan; and the ""war in terror"" which is a war on ideals, borderless, and illegal. They won't say it was to put military bases on each side of Iran (Afghanistan & Iraq) and to take over the opium production.

[Osama bin Laden was apparently found in a raid in Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Osama_bin_Laden) who possesses nukes, but I don't understand how a man who was dying of kidney failure before 9/11 supposedly lived in a cave for so long needing dialysis

America has been going through an opioid epidemic and I like to think it's correlated.

Those saying that it goes back to 9/11 are wrong. 9/11 was perpetrated by [Saudi Nationals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijackers_in_the_September_11_attacks) At least according to the official report of a passport found blocks away from the collapsed twin towers which indicated who were the hijackers.",2018-10-25T02:47:59+00:00

It's a combination of fear of the unknown and finding problems with the solutions you already have. 

No one wants to be the reason the 'next 9/11' happened, but the problem is that 'next 9/11' is such a nebulous concept to begin with. We're inside three countries out of fear of a potential attack that took only 16 people to pull off. 

It's an impossible task you will never be able to finish, especially because the American presence has been the biggest boon to Islamic terrorism than anything else in the first place. It would be hard to find someone in that region that doesn't have a friend or family member that became collateral damage in the War on Terror. 

It's trapped us in a cycle of trying to stop a growing threat that's growing because we're trying to stop it.  We keep kicking the wasp nest so the swarm of angry wasps doesn't attack the little kid's birthday party across the park. Keep in mind, we don't know if they'll actually attack the birthday party if we stop attacking their nests. What we do know is that one kid got stung in the past, and the wasps are definitely pissed off now because somebody keeps kicking their nest, so we don't dare stop. 

Secondly, we built up a very well-made system of CIA and military assets in the region and they keep finding targets because that's their job. I honestly don't know what the current Al Queda command structure is, but I'm pretty sure in the past 15+ years, we got the guy that replaced the guy, that replaced the guy. We're still left with this massive global operation, but all that's left for them in Afghanistan are local problems. Would the guy planting IED's continue do so if American convoys weren't driving down it? How many of these insurgents would continue to be insurgents if there wasn't an occupying force in their neighborhood for them to fight against? 

Again though, who wants to be the guy that says 'Stop! No more!' then wakes up to the smoldering remains of a building on every single channel? It's easier to stay the course.

Finally, the whole concept of modern warfare has become so disconnected to the modern American that the cost no longer registers with them. No one's child is getting sucked into the draft and the kids that do fight volunteered for it. Hell, with UAV's in the mix, we don't even have skin in the game most of the time. We're killing them with blips in the sky. We've basically turned the longest war in America into a chore. ",2018-10-24T21:53:02+00:00

Not even Fatah would go along with it, even if Israel was doing it to get them into power, because Fatah would completely lose whatever credibility they have left.


At the end of the day, the only thing that will change the situation with Hamas is the will of the people. And with money and education scare, you do have - and I know this term has been overused in the last 12 months - a lot of low information voters. A lot of people whose sole exposure to the outside world is what they hear on Hamas controlled radio, a lot of people who say they hate everything about Israel, but either due to political circumstance or lack of money, have never actually set foot in Israeli territory or met an Israeli.

For example, they left out the fact that Hamas' rocket attacks were a result of Israel putting in the blockade *after* Israel and the United States, in conjunction with Fatah, had attempted a coup against Hamas (see my link to the Vanity Fair article on this above.) Israel had no cause to throw up the blockade in the first place because Hamas, at that point, had done nothing for it to be required.

Second, after the wave of rocket attacks in response to the blockade, Israel brokered a cease fire with Hamas. Hamas stuck to this agreement pretty faithfully. [The Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, at Tel Aviv University, found](http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/war_on_gaza/2009/01/2009110112723260741.html) that Hamas violated the agreement only 7% of the time, whereas the vast majority of the violations came from Israel. On November 4, 2008, Israel, unprovoked, laid siege to Gaza and that's how Operation Cast Lead started, effectively ending the cease fire.

Israel used this incident as an excuse to maintain the blockade. This is left out of the Palmer Report, so when evaluating claims of legality, it's not advisable to use their report especially since the report cited the blockade as legal because of ""self defense"" (not to mention it was in part written by one of the largest human rights violaters in Latin America, Alvaro Uribe.) The report that did say the blockade was illegal was from an independent UN Human Rights commission, and they gave a fuller and more nuanced account of the events and the blockade itself.

Where did that 7% come from exactly? 

It doesn't appear anywhere in your link, nor in the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center's report it links to. 

Is it perhaps from this section?

>[According to a joint Tel Aviv University-European University study](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nancy-kanwisher/reigniting-violence-how-d_b_155611.html), this fits a larger pattern in which Israeli violence has been responsible for ending 79 per cent of all lulls in violence since the outbreak of the second intifada, compared with only 8 per cent for Hamas and other Palestinian factions.

If so, you should know that it's based solely around deaths, not violations of the agreement/ceasefire. 

>We defined “conflict pauses” as periods of one or more days when no one is killed on either side, and we asked which side kills first after conflict pauses of different durations. 

Their definition means that a constant barrage of rockets into Israel counts as a ""conflict pause"" so long as nobody dies, but if Israel responds to the attacks and someone is killed somehow it's Israel that is ending the lull in violence?

Pretty clear double standard at work here. ",2016-05-27T00:10:29+00:00

This is completely false. During the period of September 2005 to June 2007, before the attempted coup and before the blockade but after Israel unoccupied Gaza, there were over **1,000 rocket attacks on Israel**.

That's right. You're wrong. You're criticizing the Palmer Report based on false history.

>Second, after the wave of rocket attacks in response to the blockade

Rockets were fired at Israel well before the blockade. Don't lie.

> Hamas stuck to this agreement pretty faithfully. The Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, at Tel Aviv University, found that Hamas violated the agreement only 7% of the time, whereas the vast majority of the violations came from Israel.

I know it's tempting to quote Al Jazeera, a Qatari-run news source, but on Israel it's the least credible thing you can quote short of ""Al Arabiya"". His link to the ITIC is broken, and the link was to ""Rightsidenews"", which doesn't exactly inspire confidence. Surprisingly, the entire site is a mix of Islamophobic conspiracy theories.

Of course, you're also completely lying about the source. You're mixing together a Tel Aviv University-EU study with the ITIC's study. If you actually look at the [ITIC study](http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/data/pdf/PDF_08_300_2.pdf), it says that while Hamas tried to keep the agreement, other groups didn't keep it. Then when Israel responded to those other groups, Palestinians claimed Israel was ""violating the ceasefire"". Only problem is, Israel is allowed to strike groups attacking it mid-ceasefire.

Then you (and LeVine) misrepresent the study presented in the Huffington Post article. It isn't actually a study, first of all. It's just an opinion piece by three researchers in a news site. Second of all, the study looks at who *kills first*, not who actually violates the ceasefire. Israel is more likely to kill in retaliation, hence it is more likely to be pinned as at fault. But attempted murder leading to retaliation...who breaks the ceasefire in that case? Their ""study"" says Israel, but in reality attempted murder broke the ceasefire.

Consider their example. They look at November 4, 2008, and how Israel killed a Palestinian. By their telling, this was what broke the ceasefire. The problems with this are:

1) The Palestinian killed was a Hamas gunman.

2) The death was in a [gunbattle](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/world/middleeast/05mideast.html?_r=0) when Israel went to close a Hamas tunnel that **violated Israel's borders**.

The violation of the ceasefire was the tunnel. But they blame Israel for this, claiming Israel killed ""a Palestinian"" (not noting it was a Hamas gunman in a gunbattle).

Of course, such biased op-eds tend to be easy to pick apart for precisely that reason.

>On November 4, 2008, Israel, unprovoked, laid siege to Gaza and that's how Operation Cast Lead started, effectively ending the cease fire.

Uh, what? Israel went into Gaza to destroy a tunnel that was **going into Israeli territory**, meant to abduct Israelis as terrorists did with Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. In the ensuing gunbattle, a Hamas member died, and Hamas fired rockets at Israel.

There was no ""siege"" laid to Gaza leading to the operation. You're pulling history out of nowhere. Gaza was already blockaded, since Hamas had fired over 1,000 rockets at Israel from it in a year and a half **before the blockade**.

> Israel used this incident as an excuse to maintain the blockade. This is left out of the Palmer Report

The Palmer Report doesn't include false history. I should hope it left out your version.

> so when evaluating claims of legality, it's not advisable to use their report especially since the report cited the blockade as legal because of ""self defense"" (not to mention it was in part written by one of the largest human rights violaters in Latin America, Alvaro Uribe.)

Amusing accusation, considering the UNHRC is full of the largest human rights violators in the world but you're quoting their report as fact. By the way, the panel still would've sided with Israel even without Uribe, as Palmer sided with Israel himself.

The UNHRC report included people like Richard Falk, who blamed Israel for the Boston Bombings and who believes 9/11 conspiracy theories. If you want to throw mud, let's see.

> The report that did say the blockade was illegal was from an independent UN Human Rights commission

""Independent"", by including someone who doesn't support Israel's right to exist, appointed by a council that also doesn't support Israel's right to exist.

> and they gave a fuller and more nuanced account of the events and the blockade itself

They absolutely did not, and I doubt you've read both reports since you got the history so wrong.

> They concluded that it was illegal, and contradicted and amended the Palmer Committee's account

They didn't ""amend"" anything.

They were not responsible for 78% of the violations. The methodology of the ""study"", which was really just an opinion piece, was gravely flawed. They even counted Israel closing a tunnel that violated the ceasefire as a ""violation"".

>It's not a wild exaggeration. Gaza is still reeling from the 2014 Israeli airstrikes. That's in addition to the fact that Israel still drives bulldozers into Gaza to raze buildings, etc.

Israel drives in bulldozers to destroy tunnels and keep a buffer zone that prevents smuggling and tunneling into Israel. All of these are legitimate goals and needs, particularly when you border a terrorist organization. Egypt also does the same in clearing a buffer zone and flooding those tunnels.

Gaza is not ""leveled"". At all. Far less than 10% of it is ""destroyed"", and only that much is because Hamas intentionally hid among the civilian population.

No, it was from three people, one or two of whom work at the university. Not the same thing at all.

It's completely flawed. Again, they count Israel destroying a tunnel into its territory as a ""violation"", and look only at retaliations that kill one side or the other. Attempted murder is a violation, but they leave that out of their analysis, despite the many more attempts by Hamas or other terrorist groups.

It's logical to say that if a death occurs, it's because of some military action, which constitutes a breach of the agreement. Israel did that 78% of the time during the agreement. So, yes, they do look at violations of the agreement. Further, if you actually go down in the article, they show that Hamas only shot rockets 11 times during the four months out of the six month agreement. If these were ""retaliatory attacks"" on the part of Israel, then they should have only ""retaliated"" 11 times in those four months. They didn't. They *attacked* far more than that. At that fourth month is when Israel started their siege of Gaza, and so rocket attacks grew.

>Funny, I saw a link to Al Jazeera that sourced their numbers & analysis from a Huffington Post article.

If you're going to criticize the source, maybe you should actually look at it. The HuffPo article was written by the people on the TAU team. You notice the first-person style of the article, right, since you spent so much time interrogating it?

>Their analysis didn't even attempt to determine if Israel's ""violations"" were in retaliation to hostile acts, hence for all we know based on their methodology all of them may very well have been.

When you're violating the agreement 78% of the time, if those attacks were retaliatory attacks, then it stands to reason that Hamas should have been violating it 78% of the time, if not higher, as well. Meaning Hamas should have been accruing the same or higher death toll.

They weren't. Within that definition they were nowhere near that, and in the raw data they weren't, either. You're willfully choosing to be ignoring of the data that's being presented.

>It is they (and by extension you) who are making an ideological argument by pretending that rocket fire does not disrupt a ""period of nonviolence"".

The entire argument you're making is that ""for all we know"" all Israel attacks were simply reprisals. But you're not actually dealing with the data, showing that they weren't.

Chomsky argued that the only way out of the nuclear crisis was to embrace the initiative for a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East, adding that Egypt had played a leading role in advocating the initiative since 1995.
He further added that a conference was scheduled to be held in January in Helsinki to look into ways of implementing a nuclear-free zone in the region.
He argued that this initiative was blocked because of the American insistence that Israel be excluded from the plan.

From:http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138224/uri-bar-joseph/why-israel-should-trade-its-nukes

For 45 years, Israel has been the only nuclear power in the Middle East, enjoying a formidable strategic safety net against any existential threat. Since 1957, Israel has invested tremendous resources in building up a solid nuclear arsenal in Dimona. Today, according to various estimates, this stockpile comprises some 100–300 devices, including two-stage thermonuclear warheads and a variety of delivery systems, the most important of which are modern German-built submarines, which constitute the backbone of Israel’s second-strike capability. For Israel to give up these assets in the midst of an ongoing conflict strikes most Israelis as irrational.
This consensus, however, overlooks the fact that Israel’s nuclear capability has not played an important role in the country’s defense. Unlike other nuclear-armed states, Israel initiated its nuclear project not because of an opponent’s real or imagined nuclear capability but because of the worry that, in the long run, Arab conventional forces would outstrip the power of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). As early as the 1950s, Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion sought to manage the threat of modernizing Arab armies, which were inspired by pan-Arab sentiment and backed by the Soviet Union, by developing the ultimate deterrent. Shimon Peres, the architect of Israel’s nuclear program and now Israel’s president, relentlessly argued in public speeches and writings that Israel needed to compensate for the large size of the Arab armies with “science” -- a code word for nuclear arms...

The whole point is to prevent civilian casualties, which in the case of conventional warfare, are minimized because then it is optimal to strike military targets before civilian ones, unlike the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings in which civilians were the prime targets.

American and British and Allied air-forces in WWII murdered at least 3 million Japanese and German civilians in fire bombings of such non-military targets as Dresden with the deliberate intent to terrorize and slaughter the civilian population.

And I love how you sweep under the carpet the supposed ""pathetic"" offensive biological and chemical capabilities of Egypt and Syria, most of which were obtained by ex-Nazi German scientists working in Egypt in the 1950s and 60s until the Mossad assassinated them.

They call these weapons MWDs for a reason I hope you realize. The US has done studies showing that if a single brown paper bag containing just a few kilograms of weaponized Anthrax spores were dumped of the roof of a high rise in Manhattan, 5 million people would be dead in a week.

England used a remote Island north of Scotland for Anthrax testing during WWII and when they released some goats on it in the late 1980's, 40 years later,  they all dropped dead in 2 days.

The idea of settlements are ""[Facts on the ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facts_on_the_ground)"", once you have settlements on the land it makes it much harder to give the land up. Hardcore Zionists started to settle deep into the West Bank in order to establish a Jewish foothold in the region which would force the government to mass relocate them if they ever wanted to give control of the land over. There is conflicting views of how effective this would since Israel did [pull out of Gaza in 2005](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081000713.html) and forced the relocation of the settlers in that territory, but the sheer number of settlers in the West Bank make it a far more daunting task, which [some say is impossible](https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-why-israel-will-never-be-able-to-withdraw-from-the-west-bank-1.5381292).

The territory was fragmented and surrounded by enemies. Once attacked, there was little to conclude but that Israel would need to change its borders if it intended to survive.

The West Bank is important because, citing my earlier article, the city of Jerusalem was meant to be an international one, but neither the Jewish nor Arab population really wants that. Occupying large portions of the West Bank gives Israel the ability to eventually claim and defend [Jerusalem as its capital](http://www.newsweek.com/course-jerusalem-capital-israel-739860).

The settlements are very useful towards this goal, as the migration of Israelis to these areas makes it prohibitively costly or politically impossible to move them later on.

The pro-settlement security argument is an odd one because the growth of settlements [antagonizes](https://www.timesofisrael.com/state-department-says-settlements-lack-of-hope-drive-palestinian-violence/)

NeutralPolitics,comment,Settlements,dxyixnx,garlicroastedpotato,,"On this, the 2005 pull out was part of a good faith structured agreement signed between the PLO (representing all Palestinians) and The Israeli government called [The Oslo Accords](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1993-2000/oslo).

The Oslo Accords dictated that the territories of Gaza Strip and The West Bank would become an independent state of Palestine and that Israel would stop building new settlements and in fact tear down any existing ones in that border.

And Israel honored that commitment.

Just about all parts of the Oslo Accords were implemented except for one thing, the democratically elected government of Palestine.  In the past the PLO had held elections within its party in which party members could vote on who the leader is, they always chose the same person.

So they held a national election in which [HAMAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Palestine) won it.  As the legitimate government of Palestine HAMAS' first act as elected leaders was to... tear up the [Oslo Accords](http://crownheights.info/chabad-news/603270/rabbis-agree-hamas-tear-olso-accords/).

So that deal is dead.  The major problem is that the international community called the election a fraud and refused to recognize HAMAS as a legitimate government and thus believe the agreement as tabled is still in effect... just have to wait on that election.

But Israel doesn't believe the agreement is good anymore and neither does Palestine.  [The UN](https://news.un.org/en/story/2013/01/429802-ban-renews-call-rescind-plans-new-israeli-settlements-after-site-protests) still thinks it is legitimate and have called upon Israel to make settlements illegal again.

Building settlements doesn't just act as facts on the ground.  You are right in this.  But it also states that there are no Palestinians in these areas and thus they have no claim to the territory.

Israel's strategy going forward is to register as many Arabs in the region to become citizens of Israel.  Currently [1/3 of all Palestinians in Israel](https://www.haaretz.com/pa-palestinians-to-outnumber-jews-by-2020-1.5285402) are Israeli citizens.  In a couple of years the total number of Palestinians will out number Israelis.

And because of this they have stopped being worried about Palestinian people and more worried about Palestinian organizations.  By setting up these settlements in regions they're making a lot of Palestinians homeless... who will receive no help from HAMAS or Fatah. ",2018-04-25T19:08:20+00:00

First, Soviet Union forces were already in Sevastopol. During the USSR era it was the primary Naval Base for USSR Naval Fleet. 

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine took over; this did not sit well with Russia \[even when it was much weaker\]. After initial conflicts that lead to a long- term lease of the city and the base which the Russians controlled exclusively. 

https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Sevastopol

in 2014, when Ukraine deposed the pro-Russian leader with the help of the West and NATO its pro-Russian leader \[who had rejected becoming part of NATO\]; the Russians took over \[without firing a shot so to speak\], and later annexed Crimea which included Sevastopol. 

Then about the same time the Russia-backed rebels seized government buildings in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, proclaimed the creation of ""People's Republics"" and battled Ukrainian troops and volunteer battalions. 

The Minsk Agreement helped end full-scale fighting, but the situation remained tense and regular skirmishes have continued till today. The terms of the agreement were never implemented by the Ukrainians. Facing calls from Berlin and Paris for its implementation, Ukrainian officials increased their criticism of the Minsk deal and warned that it could lead to the country's demise. 

As talk of Ukraine joining NATO grew, Putin warned of conflict. That lead to the present situation. Putin does not want NATO in its backyard, nor is it happy with the three other blocks already members of NATO. 

Crimea annexation was limited. Although it is more than likely Putin will annex the two provinces too; that still would not satisfy Russia. Putin has stated Ukraine belongs to Russia. He does not recognize it as a real country and consider its government a puppet of the West and NATO. 

The present situation is different in that Putin will not be satisfied with the two provinces and it is now looking for Ukraine to resist it when it enters to the two new provinces and that will give him an excuse to enter Ukraine proper to topple its government and install its own puppet.  If Putin does not get resistance from Ukraine, it will embark on a false flag incursion.

It is an extension of it.  Russia wants to redraw borders, and it wants Ukraine's concession.  Russia covets  1/6 to 1/4 of Ukraine.  Obvious they want Crimea; history at bottom.  Massive naval base at Crimea.  This excellent video,  [Why Russia is invading Ukraine (see @ 12:30)](https://old.reddit.com/r/centrist/comments/t2mebi/why_russia_is_invading_ukraine_2022_003056/, see at  @ 12:30), discusses the economic importance of the Black Sea gas fields.

This [map](https://www.quora.com/Do-East-Ukrainians-tend-to-be-ethnically-Russian-or-do-they-tend-to-be-Russian-speakers-of-Ukrainian-blood) shows ethnic composition of Ukraine.  The south-eastern 1/6, especially Crimea, is mostly Russian.  Russia is looking at a century ahead, the status/stature it will have, by redrawing the border.

Acknowledged all this is unfair to Ukraine.  But this is hardly one nation attacking another without historical baggage.  Worst case scenario for Ukraine: Russia tries to take all its real estate on Black Sea, including Odessa.  Not logical that Russia wants to take central/west Ukraine; why would it want to saddle itself with governing a bunch of people who want freedom and separation?

NeutralPolitics,comment,Annexation,hy36dx3,magicsonar,,">In 2014, there was considerable confusion and division among Western powers about the issue of Ukraine, as the Maidan Revolution was still recent and it was unclear if the newly formed Ukrainian government would be stable or democratic. The post-Maidan governments of Ukraine have indeed proven themselves to be more stable, more democratic, and less corrupt than Yanukovych's government, so there is now greater Western support. (Yanukovych's corruption can be seen in light of the fact that he profited significantly from his role in public office, and had an uncommonly luxurious private residence that has since been turned into a museum of corruption.)

Again, this narrative is completely unsourced and unsubstantiated and is highly contested, not just by many that have studied what happened but also by the public facts.  

  
The post 2014 environment in Ukraine was far from less corrupt. All the main oligarchs remained in positions of great influence. It appears that the United States government [played a decisive role in who would be installed in government.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26079957) It was far from democratic.  Petro Poroshenko, was intensely unpopular and the [country, especially Poroshenko remained pervasively corrupt.](https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/former-ukrainian-president-poroshenko-secretly-controlled-offshore-firms-that-banked-at-austrias-raiffeisen)  Its Western-financed [economy continued to fail](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26767864). For the most part [Kyiv government continued to refuse to implement its obligations](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-under-pressure-to-implement-terms-of-minsk-peace-agreement/a-19247668) under the 2015 Minsk II peace accords, above all granting the rebel Donbass territories enough home rule to keep them in the Ukrainian state. Meanwhile, Kiev became [under the influence](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-far-right-insight-idUKBREA2618B20140307) of armed [ultranationalist battlions,](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27173857) whose ideology and symbols include proudly neofascist ones, which hate Russia and today’s Western “civilizational” values almost equally.   


In relation to the revolution/coup itself....

  
The rush to seize Yanukovych’s residence was triggered by snipers who killed some 80 or more protesters and policemen on Maidan. The western narrative, that you appear to be propagating, is that the snipers had been sent by Yanukovych.  But there is compelling evidence that at least some of the shooters were instead from the [neofascist group Right Sector](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/26/he-killed-for-the-maidan/) among the protesters on the square - including testimony from one of the ultranationalist snipers himself, [Ivan Bubenchik,](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/26/he-killed-for-the-maidan/) who admitted to shooting two police officers. 

Then we have a [leaked call from the Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet](https://youtu.be/ZEgJ0oo3OA8?t=501), who was in Ukraine at the time of Maidan (the Estonian Govt confirmed its authenticity), stated he had trusted sources that told him: *“So that there is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind the snipers it was not Yanukovich, but it was somebody from the new coalition,”*

On that same leaked call he reiterates how dirty and corrupt they believe all the new people being installed in the new Government are. 

Professor Ivan Katchanovski from the University of Ottawa conducted an [in-depth analysis of what happened in 2014.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266855828_The_Snipers_Massacre_on_the_Maidan_in_Ukraine) 

>This study establishes a precise timeline for various events of the massacre, the locations of both the shooters and the government snipers, and the specific timeline and locations of nearly 50 protesters’ deaths. It also briefly analyzes other major cases of violence during and after the “Euromaidan.” This study includes two video appendixes. This academic investigation concludes that the massacre was a false flag operation, which was rationally planned and carried out with a goal of the overthrow of the government and seizure of power. It found various evidence of the involvement of an alliance of the far right organizations, specifically the Right Sector and Svoboda, and oligarchic parties, such as Fatherland. Concealed shooters and spotters were located in at least 20 Maidan-controlled buildings or areas. The various evidence that the protesters were killed from these locations include some 70 testimonies, primarily by Maidan protesters, several videos of “snipers” targeting protesters from these buildings, comparisons of positions of the specific protesters at the time of their killing and their entry wounds, and bullet impact signs. The study uncovered various videos and photos of armed Maidan “snipers” and spotters in many of these buildings. The paper presents implications of these findings for understanding the nature of the change of the government in Ukraine, the civil war in Donbas, Russian military intervention in Crimea and Donbas, and an international conflict between the West and Russia over Ukraine.

Whether or not people will find his analysis convincing is a seperate point. The main issue here is that the facts of what happened are still contested and the narrative you have stated is highly questionable.",2022-02-23T11:24:27+00:00
NeutralPolitics,comment,Annexation,hy302ih,magicsonar,,"EDIT: the fact that this post is just downvoted, with no factual responses or rationale counter arguments is telling. 

&#x200B;

>In 2014, Russia helped instigate an armed insurrection against the newly formed Ukrainian goverment (post-Maidan). Officially, Russia denied any involvement, although it soon became clear that Russian military troops, special forces, and disinformation campaigns played a key role in initiating the conflict.

This is far from established fact. As with every conflict, there are two competing narratives.

Stephen F. Cohen, professor emeritus of Russian studies and politics at NYU and Princeton, has studied the conflict in depth and he has a very different view.

>Two conflicting narratives of the Ukrainian crisis have been a major factor in preventing its resolution. One, promoted by Washington and the US-backed government in Kiev, blames only “aggression” by the Kremlin and specifically by Russian President Putin. The other, promoted by Moscow and rebel forces in eastern Ukraine, which it supports, blames “aggression” by the European Union and NATO, both inspired by Washington. Cohen sees enough bad intent, misconceptions, and misperceptions to go around, but on balance thinks Moscow’s narrative, almost entirely deleted from US mass media, is closer to the historical realities of 2013–2014.

[source](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/four-years-of-ukraine-and-the-myths-of-maidan/)

Professor John Mearsheimer, who is the the R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in Political Science and Co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago, also believes the narrative that American and Western governments have been propagating is largely misleading and plain wrong.

This [article in Foreign Affairs l](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2014-08-18/why-ukraine-crisis-west-s-fault)ays out his reasoning. (you can also view the full text [here](https://www.natur.cuni.cz/geografie/socialni-geografie-a-regionalni-rozvoj/studium/doktorske-studium/kolokvium/kolokvium-2013-2014-materialy/ukrajina-a-rusko-mearsheimer-souleimanov.pdf)).

>According to the prevailing wisdom in the West, the Ukraine crisis can be blamed almost entirely on Russian aggression. Russian President Vladimir Putin, the argument goes, annexed Crimea out of a long-standing desire to resuscitate the Soviet empire, and he may eventually go after the rest of Ukraine, as well as other countries in eastern Europe. In this view, the ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014 merely provided a pretext for Putin’s decision to order Russian forces to seize part of Ukraine.  
>  
>But this account is wrong: the United States and its European allies share most of the responsibility for the crisis. The taproot of the trouble is NATO enlargement, the central element of a larger strategy to move Ukraine out of Russia’s orbit and integrate it into the West. At the same time, the EU’s expansion eastward and the West’s backing of the pro-democracy movement in Ukraine -- beginning with the Orange Revolution in 2004 -- were critical elements, too. Since the mid-1990s, Russian leaders have adamantly opposed NATO enlargement, and in recent years, they have made it clear that they would not stand by while their strategically important neighbor turned into a Western bastion. For Putin, the illegal overthrow of Ukraine’s democratically elected and pro-Russian president -- which he rightly labeled a “coup” -- was the final straw. He responded by taking Crimea, a peninsula he feared would host a NATO naval base, and working to destabilize Ukraine until it abandoned its efforts to join the West.

NeutralPolitics,comment,Annexation,hyy8f16,Markdd8,,"> Despite Putin's rhetoric which has consistently indicated that he fears NATO-backed militarization of Ukraine, I think Putin fears the possibility of a thriving democratic Ukraine affiliated with the EU far more.

That is correct, but he probably realizes he can't do anything about that.  What is he going do? --  take over all of Ukraine and suppress the nation indefinitely?  It makes far more sense for him to redraw the borders, which he is already in the process of doing.  Most of my post from elsewhere here:

NeutralPolitics,comment,Occupation,cfy6w4m,Maximus8910,,"It's the annexation thing.  Ignore Afghanistan, because that was a punishment invasion for 9/11; let's focus on Iraq.  When comparing the American invasion of Iraq to the Russian invasion of Crimea, there is a superficial difference in the rhetoric used to justify the invasions, but there is a far more important concrete difference.  Let's talk about the concrete difference.

Look at a map.  You see where Crimea is?  You see where Russia is?  Now check out the relative positions of Iraq and America.  See, the invasion of Iraq was never, under any circumstances, going to turn into an annexation, and the rest of the world understood that.  That doesn't mean it was justified, but it does mean that it didn't threaten global stability.  Now let's talk about why the Crimean thing threatens global stability.

There hasn't been a true global conflict since 1945, and maybe the biggest reason for this is that there has been a global geopolitical understanding that nobody needs to conquer any new land.  Sure, there have been smaller wars and territory has changed hands; but the major powers pretty much sat down at the end of WWII and decided the borders were going to be drawn with permanent marker instead of pencil this time.  I'm not saying this is right--it's also led to plenty of proxy wars and deaths in smaller countries--but it has been a cornerstone of the general global stability that has defined international politics since WWII.

And this is what Putin is threatening.  He's rolled tanks into a neighboring country.  He's gotten a local government to ""vote"" to join Russia (it was a unanimous vote--if you think that was true democracy, I have a bridge in Brooklyn you might be interested in purchasing).  This is **not** how geopolitics works in the 20th century.

So here's the bottom line: Putin's occupation of Crimea, which is a old-fashioned attempt at imperial border expansion, is more-or-less unprecedented in the modern world.  Is he crazy enough to start WWIII?  Probably not, because there are real and understandable reasons to think this was a special situation for him, but it's still an extremely dangerous precedent to set in a world that agreed on borders staying put 70 years ago.  Every country on the Russian border is trying to figure out how to make sure they aren't next just in case this isn't a one-time thing.  And the rest of the major Western powers are trying to figure out how they're going to deal with Putin in the future, given that he clearly isn't playing the same game as them.  It's a major shift in international politics, and, in a world that has been fairly peaceful since 1945, any major change is cause for alarm.",2014-03-09T14:21:37+00:00

Prior the the US and UK incursion into Iraq, Saddam Hussein had twice used chemical weapons on those wrongly described as his own people, killing hundreds of thousands of Kurds and Shi'ites.

Hussein was a genocidal dictator who sold the natural resources of his own country to the highest bidder, and kept the money to fund what was at the time the worlds largest international crime family - in both territorial reach and wealth. The Iraqi ""administration"" was harbouring internationally wanted criminals, violating non-proliferation treaties and worse.

While it's harder to specify exactly what the UK wanted, the US executed the [Iraq Liberation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Liberation_Act) to remove Hussein from power and allow the country to vote for a democratically elected leader.

Your examples don't come even close, because that would be oversea territories.

Here are two facts about Crimea you must know and understand:

- Crimea is the harbor of the Russian Black Sea fleet. The black sea fleet is stationed there for longer ([since May 13th, 1783](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Fleet) ) than the USA exist as a recognized, independent country ([ September 3rd, 1783](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783) )!

- Crimea is very close to Russian territory. And you actually have to compare satellite photos with vector maps to see, how unclear it is, to which country Crimea is actually attached to. In the news you normally see only the political maps, which however are largely misrepresentative. See http://stevecoast.com/2014/03/02/ukrainian-maps-and-the-lies-they-tell/ and http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/73313000/jpg/_73313162_crimea_simferopol_airports_insert_624_v2.jpg and https://maps.google.com/?ll=45.259422,33.760986&spn=2.277368,3.834229&t=m&z=8 and http://www.bing.com/maps/embed/?v=2&cp=45.269383~33.724116&lvl=7&dir=0&sty=r&form=LMLTEW&emid=92290dad-cbce-b0cf-44db-7eb806f36b1b


To really understand what the whole Crimea situation means for the Russians imagine the following: In 1939 (there was war in Europe, but it wasn't a world war, yet, compare that with American involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan) there would have been a political revolution in Hawaii (for those of you not aware of 20th century history of USA, Hawaii officially joined the Union as late as 1950), and the new local government was politically leaning toward Japan. But the USA have their Pacific Fleet in harbor in Hawaii (Pearl Harbor); of course it would have been in the interest of the USA to secure their military assets there.

**TL;DR: The situation now, is as if Hawaii would have detached from the USA and gotten close to Japan in 1939, with the US Pacific Fleet being stationed in Pearl Harbor. Replace Hawaii → Crimea, USA → Russia.**",2014-03-09T11:36:39+00:00

The Republic of Texas never administered the area in between the Nueces River and Rio Grande since Tejas never included it (most of it was part of Tamaulipas which retains a strange shape due to this annexation). When the US annexed Texas we pushed the shaky claim on this area and that was the cause of the Mexican-American War.

One thing I really dislike about US Americans talking about ""their"" wars is that usually only US casulties are mentioned. Did more people die in those wars that there are imhabitants in Crimea?

Afghanistan was different, in that it was a legal invasion.

Iraq and Crimea are both illegal invasions and violate a number of international treaties signed by the offending nation.

So far, another difference is that Russia has not yet openly violated some of the oldest and most basic treaties for the protection of human rights during wartime, like the Geneva Convention. The USA openly said that it would not follow the Geneva Convention so that it could torture its prisoners. The did it by calling them ""enemy combatants"" and claiming that the Geneva Convention was only valid of ""soldiers"". So far, not even Putin has gotten that low.

My point, outside the US, the country has lost a lot of its credibility during the Bush years, and when Kerry gave his first speech on the Crimea invention, it was almost comic to hear him accusing Putin of doing things the USA had done themselves only a few years earlier.

The US previously invaded and nominally administered Cuba after the Spanish-American war.  They established a friendly government, a naval base at Guantanamo, and took a lease for 100 years.

Then later the country had a revolution and became an unfriendly government.  The US actually did try and invade Cuba but failed miserably.   But the lease still stands.

Then the lease expired, but the US just decided not to move. 

Both Guantanamo and Crimean peninsula are strategically important naval bases for both the US and Russia respectively.

NeutralPolitics,comment,Occupation,cg0k4r7,mjo4red,,"America’s annexation of Hawaii in 1898 extended U.S. territory into the Pacific. For most of the 1800s, leaders in Washington were concerned that Hawaii might become part of a European nation’s empire. During the 1830s, Britain and France forced Hawaii to accept treaties giving them economic privileges. In 1842, Secretary of State Daniel Webster sent a letter to Hawaiian agents in Washington affirming U.S. interests in Hawaii and opposing annexation by any other nation. In 1849, the United States and Hawaii concluded a treaty of friendship that served as the basis of official relations between the parties.
An 1875 trade reciprocity treaty further linked the two countries and U.S. sugar plantation owners from the United States came to dominate the economy and politics of the islands. When Queen Liliuokalani moved to establish a stronger monarchy, Americans under the leadership of Samuel Dole deposed her in 1893. The planters’ belief that a coup and annexation by the United States would remove the threat of a devastating tariff on their sugar also spurred them to action. The administration of President Benjamin Harrison encouraged the takeover, and dispatched sailors from the USS Boston to the islands to surround the royal palace. The U.S. minister to Hawaii, John L. Stevens, worked closely with the new government.
Dole sent a delegation to Washington in 1894 seeking annexation, but the new President, Grover Cleveland, opposed annexation and tried to restore the Queen. Dole declared Hawaii an independent republic. Spurred by the nationalism aroused by the Spanish-American War, the United States annexed Hawaii in 1898 at the urging of President William McKinley. Hawaii was made a territory in 1900, and Dole became its first governor. Racial attitudes and party politics in the United States deferred statehood until a bipartisan compromise linked Hawaii’s status to Alaska, and both became states in 1959.

NeutralPolitics,comment,Occupation,cfyae4y,gradstudent4ever,,"I'm on a ""no dumb comparisons"" kick these days. Over and over again, I see people making foolish comparisons as a way of supporting an otherwise ill-supported, illogical point of view. For instance, people want to argue that telling women not to wear revealing clothes is an effective anti-rape strategy and isn't victim blaming. They compare rape to robbery; if someone left his wallet on the dashboard of his parked car in a bad neighborhood, we would hold him accountable for having his wallet stolen, because he could have avoided that fate with some simple common sense. The comparison is wrong for a number of reasons which I shall not repeat here, unless someone genuinely doesn't understand why I object to this nonsensical false equivalency.





**However**, the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan potentially have features which make discussing those ethics of invasion useful for thinking about Russia and Ukraine. I am not yet certain whether or not this comparison is as empty as the rape-robbery corollary; the historical backgrounds and contemporary contexts of the two situations are no doubt very, very different, so despite some superficial parallels, it's possible that the comparison doesn't make much sense.





My instinct, though, is that the question of the legality is germane. The US invaded Afghanistan based on excellent evidence that the perpetrator of an attack on sovereign US soil was hiding in that country and would not be routed out by the Taliban; I am pretty sure we were at least close to being within our rights to do what we did. We have the right to defend ourselves, and this enemy had proven capable of hurting us very badly. 




The US invaded Iraq on a false pretext. It seems apparent that we fabricated evidence or simply accepted very flimsy evidence to justify the invasion of a sovereign country that posed no immediate threat to us or to our neighbors or allies. It was an illegal invasion and the US has never faced justice for its actions, in part because we simply do not allow the international criminal court to adjudicate our behavior. Some of our reasons for that are good. But there is no proper mechanism for us to be held accountable for illegal behaviors, and we have not been.





It seems that Russia is fabricating evidence to justify the invasion of a sovereign country. 




Ethically and legally, it looks to me as if the US invasion of Iraq is comparable to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

NeutralPolitics,comment,UN Resolution,dd916a8,None,,"Quick point: Your source does not claim Trump said the missile test ""violated"" UN Resolution 2231.

>The recent ballistic missile launch is also in defiance of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls upon Iran “not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.” 

This statement is absolutely true. The launch was in defiance of the resolution. But this is different from ""violation"".

Iran, as usual, is taking advantage of that semantic difference to claim it isn't ""a violation"" (assuming they said that, I'm not sure that's a direct quote).

Y'see, the resolution saying ""calls upon"" is regarded by some to be something that is a *request*, voluntary but not compulsory in any way. That's the position taken by experts who claim this doesn't ""violate"" the resolution, it merely ""goes against the spirit"" of the resolution, a position taken by [the Obama administration](http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/274954-obama-iran-has-followed-letter-but-not-spirit-of-nuke-deal) fairly consistently.

So was it a violation? Probably not. Does it go against the spirit of it? Yes. It appears the Trump administration is more prepared to police the spirit of the agreement, and show a more forceful tone, to Iranian actions related to missiles.

Trump doesn't appear to have claimed a violation, to my knowledge. He appears to have had the same view of ""defiance"" that Obama did, but not violation, and is preparing to take a more forceful line as I mentioned.",2017-02-02T20:32:41+00:00

Brief background, condensed from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html).

> Following World War II, the British withdrew from their mandate of Palestine, and the UN proposed partitioning the area into Arab and Jewish states, an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Nonetheless, an Israeli state was declared in 1948 and the Israelis subsequently defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending the deep tensions between the two sides. Israel and Palestinian officials signed in 1993 a Declaration of Principles (also known as the ""Oslo Accords""), enshrining the idea of a two-state solution to their conflict and guiding an interim period of Palestinian self-rule. However, this solution has repeatedly been undermined by undermined by conflict between Israel and Palestinian groups, and the years since then have been characterized by alternations between diplomacy and violence.

NeutralPolitics,comment,Two-state solution,ctl1saz,None,,"There are a number of things the factbook fails to mention.

Jews started moving to the Middle East with the general idea of establishing a community/state there decades before WW2 - but for many of the same reasons they left later...namely, that Europe was a mean place to live if you were an other.

Additionally, much of the population of Israel moved there from *other parts of the middle east*. Iraq had a large Israeli population, as did Iran. As did a lot of places. This question would additionally have to be posed in the context of their ""better outcome"". Would it be better for a disparate people to live as voiceless minorities, inherently marginalized by the systems and governments of the countries they lived in, or to have a small, concentrated place to live with their own sovereignty?

Now, despite what a lot of you are probably thinking, I'm not Jewish, nor really an interested party in any of this. I'm also not really an apologist for the way the Israelis have conducted themselves since Reagan gave them functional carte blanche to accelerate settlement of the West bank.

But, you have to figure, a large percentage of the Israelis who fled WW2 to Israel wouldn't have survived the war if they had no place to go. It's doubtful (with the way the Middle East was carved up by the Allies after the wars) that the muslim world would be any more peaceful...and if anything, the west would simply have less of a vested interest in interacting there...so much of that Jewish diaspora in the Middle East would probably have gone the way of the Kurds or the Yazidis or any other minority group which has to live prostrate  in a war torn land.

But, at the same time, it's hard to look at the century of war and conflict between the Jews and the Muslims and feel some great sense of meaning there. I think the flaw in this question is that it implies a binary 'either it would be better or it would be worse'...whereas, maybe there's a third option: 'a lot of this could have been done differently and it sucks that it wasn't.'

One thing's for certain - the Palestinians would probably be a lot happier if everyone had just stayed home. But I guess that's irrelevant in the sea of context and justification people like to attach to the world.",2015-07-30T01:47:00+00:00
NeutralPolitics,comment,Two-state solution,ctkltk8,devDoron,,"Well, for one, we should take into consideration all of the good that Israel has contributed to the world. Very high (if not highest) PHDs per capita. Significant efforts towards disasters (first to have a hospital up in Haiti after the earthquake to which the US hospitals latched on to). They take in many refugees that will not be accepted by any of their neighboring countries (from places like Darfur). They also contribute many technologies which they share with and collaborate with the US on (some examples: Intel, airforce, iron dome). And much more (this was just stuff from the top of my head). In addition to all of that, they provide a place for Jews around the world to congregate where they will not be discriminated against as they have been for millennia. ",2015-07-29T19:01:15+00:00
NeutralPolitics,comment,Two-state solution,ctl9l9s,shulzi,,"This is an interesting question, but I believe this question asks in another way does Israel have the right to exist. Consequently, it would inevitably bring in ideas of Zionism into play.

But, I will try to answer this question in the way that you ask. I think one of the reasons to remember why Israel was pushed for as a homeland for Jews was from Jews themselves. The [Dreyfus Affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_affair) gave the impression to most Jews in Europe that nationalism would not ultimately subvert European antisemitic sentiments, and that Jews were safe (according to many) where they were a majority.

Following this, there was a proposal in the early 20th Century by the British for [Jews to settle in Uganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda_Scheme). However, this was largely rejected, because there was a desire for Jews to reconnect with their historical homeland, and the land itself was hostile and dangerous (animals and tribes alike).

So, with Jews pushing for the land of Israel to be created, and it ultimately being created, I would say that Israel has provided a positive result for Jews around the world to know that there is a country that they will never be persecuted on an ideological basis from within the country. And this country is in an area where there historical linkages that are thousands of years old.

This is a big plus. Some may argue that the US would be a fine destination for Jews after World War 2, however, many Jews who live in America still don't take the friendship for granted. It should be noted that US-Israel relations only started to take off after the [Suez Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis) in 1956 when Britain and France forced Israel into a position to act unilaterally against Egypt. Many right wing Jews do not like Obama simply because he takes a more nuanced view regarding Israeli-Arab relations than Bush.

So to me, the establishment itself is justified. The process in which it was done, however, is highly questionable.  When western colonial powers entered the Middle East after World War 1, they acted with very little understanding towards diminishing ethnic tensions in the region, with the British separately making commitments to both Arabs and Jews that their states will be established. When Jews eventually did declare and fight in 1948 for the establishment of Israel, the vast majority of Palestinian Arabs resettled in the neighbouring countries. However, they maintained their status as refugees. Today, this is still an issue. [Most Arab countries uphold a 55+ year old Arab League resolution that prevents Palestinians from becoming local citizens.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League_and_the_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict#1949.E2.80.9367)

What about Israel's legacy so far? The fact is that Israel has managed to create a largely democratic, strong economy full of educated individuals that allows many in the Middle East to prosper. While Arab-Israeli rights still lag behind Jews within Israel, these rights and access to resources are still far superior to neighbouring countries. Importantly, [**Israel is seen as a refuge for LGBT people in the Middle East.**](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29628281) The education and resources Israel has means that its citizens are able to help wider society much more easily and effectively than before its creation.

So, despite the trouble that has been created due to Israel's establishment, my belief is that the good that has come out of it would not have been achieved otherwise. The bad on the other hand? I'm not so sure.",2015-07-30T06:07:36+00:00

It's just so frustrating because by perpetuating the idea that Israel has less right to exist than say, Lebanon, it just feeds into the violence and perpetual fighting. Israel is there, it's not going away. We can debate for another hundred years whether or not it was created in the right way but it doesn't change the fact that it's there, and until people accept that Israel exists and has as much claim to sovereignty as any other nation, we will have never ending fighting.

I can't prove that it was one of the punk kids who comes by every once in a while selling remote control cars or fake flowers or exercise equipment or whatever else ""fell off the back of a truck"", but I certainly always meet them with distrust. Really, anyone who walks into my office soliciting gets that treatment. Were I ever to find the person who did steal my stuff - I hardly think I would want life to just go on as normal for both of us. There is no ""civil resolution to the problem that is advantageous to both parties"" in that case. I imagine it would be much worse for those who lost a loved one in a drunk driving accident or a violent crime, and moreso again for anyone who had their daughter claimed as property or a friend or loved one beheaded or blown up in a market place.

This is where I see your analogy to normal life break down.

>My bias is to say we shouldn't be in Afghanistan at all (though I'd say it's more justified than Iraq), but since we're there and we've already mucked things up considerably, it would be nice if we left on a good note -

That's fair enough.

> I would much prefer that this turn out like Japan in the aftermath of WWII, but if we keep treating them as the enemy instead of acknowledging the fact that the Taliban does have some legitimate grievances, we won't ever get to any vaguely optimal resolution.

Well, in Japan did we treat them like they had legitimate grievances after WW2? What are the legitimate grievances you see in Afganistan?

All Afghans, and anyone who's studied Afghan history, know this.  From the day the war started, the Taliban knew that victory was inevitable.  They just had to keep up a low scale insurgency until the US got tired of fighting and left.

I suspect the Americans are just looking for a way to save face.  Some agreement that will allow them to proclaim victory before they leave, but it's all hogwash.

It's the Karzai government that's going to have to deal with the Taliban, one way or another.  They should be the ones doing the negotiating.  I'd trust their judgement on whether doing so is worthwhile.

Besides, terrorism (if defined as tactics where goal is to create terror and not actual war like destruction of enemy infrastructure that actually hampers economy or war effort of the enemy)  with conventional weapons causes much less civilian casualties than wars and civil wars.

AmericanPolitics,post,West Bank,173tmgb,Georgeo57,AI Nationbuilding Test: Draw some analogies between the American Revolution and the Israel-Hamas war.,"There are a few analogies that can be drawn between the American Revolution and the Israel-Hamas war:

Both conflicts were fought for independence.** The American Revolution was fought by the thirteen colonies to gain independence from Great Britain. The Israel-Hamas war is a conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which seeks to establish an independent Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.

Both conflicts were fought by a smaller force against a more powerful one.** The American colonists were outnumbered and outgunned by the British army. The Israeli military is much more powerful than Hamas, but Hamas has the advantage of fighting on home territory and using guerrilla tactics.

Both conflicts were fought over land and resources.** The American colonists wanted to control their own land and resources, while the Palestinians want to control the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.

Both conflicts were protracted and bloody.** The American Revolution lasted for eight years, and the Israel-Hamas war has been ongoing for decades.

Both conflicts have involved international actors.** The American colonists received support from France and other European countries, while Hamas receives support from Iran and other Muslim-majority countries.

However, there are also some important differences between the two conflicts:

The American Revolution was fought against a foreign power, while the Israel-Hamas war is a civil war.** This means that the two sides in the Israel-Hamas war are more closely intertwined, and there is a greater risk of civilian casualties.

The American Revolution was fought for the ideals of liberty and self-determination, while the Israel-Hamas war is fought over land and resources.** This means that the stakes in the Israel-Hamas war are even higher, as both sides are fighting for their very existence.

Overall, the American Revolution and the Israel-Hamas war are two complex conflicts with both similarities and differences. It is important to understand the context of each conflict in order to draw meaningful comparisons.

AmericanPolitics,comment,Jerusalem,dqvelrv,glenskin90,,"> The difference between President Trump and Obama is that President Trump actually fulfills his promises.

We all know that Obama is a lying war criminal. That's not news and it's now history.

But Trump is simply the same. We can see that by many issues like his BS about repealing ObamaCare. Why the hell hasn't our liar-in-chief fulfilled that campaign promise?

We all know the answer: repealling ObamaCare would make things worse, so the Republicans had to swallow years and years of political BS and rhetoric and keep ObamaCare in place. And of course our corporate mass media is too busy with new Cold War stories to bother reporting the Republicans' hypocrisy and position on the issue.

And so we all continue to be ""indentured servants"" to the rich shareholders of private, for-profit health insurance corporations because our 2 corrupt and worthless political parties are bought and paid for.

AmericanPolitics,comment,Jerusalem,dqwuowk,glenskin90,,"> we have no successful history of negotiating with terrorists,

WTF? I gave a quote above about Reagan trading weapons with Iran to get US/western hostages out of Lebanon. Reagan also traded arms for the 53 American Embassy hostages held by Iranian students.

Those negotiations with terrorists not only got the hostages freed, but they bolstered Reagan/the US strategy of having Iraq and Iran fight, making them desperate for money and willing to pump oil like madmen to get more money. That strategy worked to lower the cost of oil *and* free the hostages.

> we don't do that

Again, that's mindless political rhetoric -- real history *screams* that's not true; we *do* negotiate with terrorists and often those negotiations work.

>  if Bush had just allowed israel to join the coalition against saddam hussein 20 years ago...

It would have been impossible.

We had to lie through our teeth to get the Saudi dictator to give us military bases to fight the war against Kuwait/Iraq. We did that by showing the semi-literate Saudi dictator doctored satellite photos with us claiming that Iraq was going to invade Saudi Arabia -- complete BS, but the idiot believed us so we got our military bases. (Osama Bin Laden would later say those bases were the reason he started attacking the US.)

* If Israel would have been part of that US coalition, the Saudis would have never given us those bases -- we would have been unable to fight that war.

* If Israel had been part of that US coalition, there was no way Arab countries would have supported the US war to restore the Kuwaiti dictator.

Like it or not, Israel is a pariah nation in *most* of the world's eyes.

Your claim that adding Israel would have somehow magically make us win the war that we did win is absurd. Israel is nowhere near the military power it claims to be or once was.

The 2006 Israeli invasion of Lebanon proved that.

In 2006 the Israelis launched a large ground offensive into Lebanon but Hezbollah's local forces in southern Lebanon (not even Hezbollah's best forces!) stunned the Israelis. Israel's offensive was blunted so effectively that Israel could not even advance and capture the *first* town in Lebanon that they intended to capture. Hezbollah simply stopped the Israeli army, which is why Israel today is eager to do something to again attack Lebanon to reduce Hezbollah's military capacity.

AmericanPolitics,comment,Jerusalem,dqvfe5u,glenskin90,,"What are you talking about?

We had eliminated NK's nuclear program, thanks to the agreement Bill Clinton negotiated *after Clinton provoked NK into developing nukes in the first place by running Pentagon war games of a nuclear first-strike on NK.*

That agreement stopped NK's nuclear program in its tracks, had full IAEA inspections in NK, and was set to have NK buying US-made/designed, proliferation-resistant light water nuclear reactors which would have given us significant influence in NK by creating a critical dependency on the US.

But our torturing war criminal president George W. Bush broke the agreement, and NK restarted its nuclear program, tested first a nuke and then a hydrogen bomb, and is now busy building missiles.

What part of that history was a ""smart"" (or even a *moral*) move by us?

AmericanPolitics,comment,Jerusalem,dqwvw8n,glenskin90,,"Israel has been in violation of UN resolutions calling for Israel to withdraw from the lands it seized in the 1967 war. That's 1/2 century of Israel being a criminal apartheid regime thumbing its nose at the world.

Israel seized the so-called ""occupied territories"" by training the Israeli air force for months and then launching a sneak attack on 5 Arab countries which wiped out the Arab air forces on the ground. Israel then followed that sneak air attack up with a ground offensive that was wildly successful and in which Israel seized Egypt's Sinai, the Gaza Strip, West Bank, East Jerusalem, Syria's Golan Heights, and a little chunk of Lebanon.

Since its founding, the UN position -- and the official position of the US gov't, of course -- has been that seizing land via war is an international crime. It's an application of the *immoral* principle of ""might makes right.""

Since Israel seized those lands in a war, the entire world has refused to recognize Jerusalem as the apartheid state's capital.

Trump's move of recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital undermines international law and the UN. It sets an evil and immoral precedent. (But what else should one expect from the US government -- a government which shields and protects literal war criminals and torturers?)

We hold no moral high ground.

Is that what you meant by an argument?

And no, I am not recommending RCV for the House members' voting on this issue. Sure, it could work and they can already do this, but that approach, on its own anyway, insists that you and I give up our power of the electorate.

The power we as voters can wield will come from widespread use of Ranked Choice Voting so we are no longer left with a hard choice of one specific or another specific. RCV has been shown to reduce divisive campaigning and increase civility in political campaigns as well as offer a true wider range of choice. (We like choice in our fast foods, and I'm willing to bet we'll love choice in our democratic processes.)

Think of the prospect of being able to vote for somebody who shares your values yet is committed to working with those of other thoughts in a peaceful and thoughtful manner. Think of a Speaker elected by a majority of our national Representatives and not by this or that political party.

Obama: ""let's not rock the boat, nobody will be held accountable. ""

Snowden / Assange / Manning: ""the US has committed atrocities that deserve nuremberg like processes.... ""

US: ""Lol, what crimes, we just hold a couple of political prisoners without any evidence or due legal process on extraterritory we have rented, lol, if this is forbidden who will say anything? ""

TV : shows pictures of US military honorless swine (can not be called soldiers anymore) using marked cars of first responders as target practice (collateral murder), torturing the shit out of prisoners , and to top it all of, under the presidency of a nobel peace prize winner, that essentially got his nobel peace prize for ""skincolor and because he was no longer bush"", one guy with a token nobel peace prize orders his army to disregard thye geneva convention, and shoot up a hospital, belonging to an actual nobel peace prize winner, causing defenseless innocents inside there to burn, but what is this? Officcial investigation, done by their own chain of command structure, finds no fault of conduct, just a lot of unfortunate technical error?

we get reminded of the haague invasion doctrine, that if we actually arrested an american swine for war crimes, and dragghed him in front of the haague, the US would stand by ready to invade their closest ally. Better not rock the boat everybody? 

Assange gets held on phony charges for how many years? 

US crashes the worlds financial markets when again, and then refuses to jail any of their bankers? 

US promised to close the guantanamo bay extermination camp, and.... wow, the american left everybody, same as the american right, both raising the arm and going, sieg heil, america, we wioll not abide by the standards we hoild others to....

At this point, happy news, if nothing else comes out of holding trump accountable, would it even make the international news? 

Would there be an outcry of ""FINALLY? ""

Nope, it would be the same as every year. 

America screaming ""we have to hold everyone else accountable, but not us....""

You wanna hold america accountable?

And every politician that says this is an outrage and hostile to america would hbe hard to understand, because he would have to say it with his lips around a shotgun barrel? 

No? That too much ""Hold accountable"" for you? How about you agree to extradite either the bush or the Obama junta, in completion, for processing tregarding crimes against humanity? Also no? 

How about putting a term limit on the wars in the middle east? No? THis war will be held as long as needed, and we will not do a single thing for the refugees our actions create? And settle your valuable allies with the bills, whoile demanding they pay even more, and they buy all their shit from you? very well.

The gun product is specifically made for the purpose of killing or sport shooting, to support self defense or hunting / marksmanship. And I don't believe gun advertisements market on the basis of quantity of murder deaths possible. I believe they market on qualities of the weapon, e.g. aesthetics, fire rate, caliber, etc, just as Hershey markets on qualities pertinent to snacking, e.g. blend of flavors, calorie count, source of the choco. If you have an example advert that guided your comment, please share it.

Just because guns' purpose is very different from candy, doesn't make it less of a product, or imply the producer is responsible for inappropriate or illegal use when there are in fact appropriate and legal uses and reasons for the product's existence. 

 >If the car was marketed as a tool to kill people with, then yes you could sue and win for the same reason the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre did.

A car's purpose is to drive. Why would it be marketed as a tool to kill? Self defense and hunting are valid, culturally significant, and LEGAL uses of guns, and the product is marketed as such. 

Is Louisville slugger accountable for assaults that take place with a baseball bat? The product is marketed for hitting.

AmericanPolitics,comment,Annexation,ezaz2rl,IntnsRed,,"> and then almost 100 years of stability...

What planet do you live on?!

Look at the wars we've waged since WWII.

It started in Korea when the civil war between the Korean hero Kim fought against the US-backed Korean dictator/traitor. Our South Korean dictator used to be a collaborator with hated Japan when they colonized Korea. When our South Korean quisling's forces collapsed the US used the fact that the Soviets were boycotting the UN (over Berlin) and ramrodded a UN ""war"" over Korea. The revolution-torn Chinese intervened and fought the US to a standstill, with us threatening to use nukes in a temper tantrum because we couldn't win.

Today -- 50+ years later! -- the US refuses to officially end the Korean War because as long as we keep the war going we retain full command-and-control over *all* of South Korea's millions of soldiers.

Imagine: Today a South Korean private's ""chain of command"" ends not with the South Korean president -- it ends with a US general (or the *US* president). Keeping that war going effectively makes South Korea a country occupied by the US.

But we went on to attack country after country -- on all continents except Australia and Antarctica.

We slaughtered *millions* trying to conquer Vietnam and the countries of southeast Asia -- breaking an int'l treaty to hold free and fair elections and supporting a Catholic dictator in that Buddhist country -- all because the CIA accurately reported that any free elections would have the Vietnamese nat'l hero (the communist Ho Chi Minh) win by a landslide.

How many countries have we attacked in the oil rich Middle East? Did you forget the million people we slaughtered in Iraq and our torture and deliberate lies to attack that country? Did you forget the US Congress publicly talking about stealing Iraq's oil to pay for our war of aggression based on lies?

And you have *the gall* to call our many, many wars (by far more than any other country!) ""stability""?!

We've impoverished the American people and have a gargantuan national debt because of the militarism of that ""stability."" And now we're losing our freedoms due to militarism, just like our founding fathers predicted.

> ""Of all the enemies to public liberty, war is perhaps the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other. War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes...known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few...No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare."" -- James Madison, Political Observations, 1795.",2019-09-06T22:49:13+00:00

Yes. Bill Clinton imported Muslim fundamentalist proxy soldiers during the breakup of Yugoslavia to be used in Bosnia. (We gained expertise using Muslim fundamentalists as our proxy soldiers when we enacted our evil plot *to provoke* the USSR into sending troops to help a friendly gov't in next-door Afghanistan.)

The US later issued Serbia de facto ""surrender demands"" that called on Serbia to rescind its sovereignty and to be occupied by NATO. When the Serbs logically refused, the US attacked and bombed the nearly defenseless Serbia forcing it to grant independence to Kosovo.

Many of the war criminals our mass media heralded as bad guys during the 1990s were later released on appeal after their rigged show-trials.

The famous British story about Serbian camps starving people -- and [this famous Time magazine cover](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/nintchdbpict000368539249.jpg) -- was pure war propaganda, complete [lies](https://off-guardian.org/2018/02/22/lies-the-london-guardian-told-me-or-the-return-of-villainy/). (The British reporter actually stepped *inside* an enclosed barbed wire area and took pictures outward towards the people walking around freely.) But we ate it up with a spoon because our ""free press"" peddled the gov't propaganda (just like in Iraq and many other US-initiated wars).

> ...none approaching the carnage in WWI and II.

Oh, you're right -- none of those *US-initiated* wars were as bad as the worst two wars of the past few centuries!

Mainly because the big powers are hamstrung -- they cannot fight each other because they have nukes.

That's what NK learned from Iraq: If you have nukes the world's aggressive pit bull, the US, cannot attack you. If you don't have nukes, you'll end up like our old ally Saddam Hussein when the US turns on you.

I did not say that. I'm not sure of the origins.

But it is a fact that we beamed in divisive ethnic hatred into the multi-ethnic Yugoslavia *for decades* as part of our Cold War anti-communist campaigns.

> And the Soviets invasion of Afghanistan was also our fault?

That is indisputable -- the Carter administration cooked up that scheme.

Carter's NSC guru, Zbigniew Brzezinski gave an interview where he described the plot. We armed the nutty Muslim fundamentalists knowing and hoping that the USSR would intervene in that friendly country on their border, to give ""the USSR its Vietnam war.""

The day the USSR sent troops in Brzezinski was thrilled. Then we pulled out all of the propaganda stops calling the intervention an ""invasion.""

Carter even went so far as to boycott the Moscow Olympics (drawing all of the appropriate parallels to Hitler, of course!). Imagine that: Carter lied to the American people about this ""invasion"" when it was a US gov't plot to deliberately *provoke* the USSR into acting!

Here's [one article](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2017/05/no_author/real-story-zbigniew-brzezinski/) from a right-wing source which covers some of this history which has been flushed down the Orwellian ""memory hole.""

Of course, Carter was soon to leave office and it was Reagan who really ramped things up.

To brainwash Muslims into going into Afghanistan to fight against the Soviet Red Army (the same military that beat the Nazis), the US worked with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to set up Muslim schools (the Arabic word for school is ""madrassa"") to teach the warped Saudi version of militant Wahhabi Islam. Those schools produced indoctrinated ""taliban"" (the Arabic word for ""student"").

Hmm, taliban -- where have I heard that before...

AmericanPolitics,comment,UN Resolution,c04wxb1,None,,"I don't think that is plausible.

1st, the UN is often unable to curtail human rights abuses by some the least powerful, most corrupt, and most oppressive governments.  Considering we are one of the most powerful (or perhaps the single most powerful, as many maintain) it is unlikely the UN can do shit about the erosion of our civil liberties.  If the UN can barely get humanitarian aid into Burma, which has one of the worst records vis-a-vis human rights abuses, it's unlikely they'll be putting the squeeze on the U.S. gov. over our quickly--but thus far fairly smoothly-- cosing society.

2nd, [wikipedia says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#Human_rights_and_humanitarian_assistance),

> The (UN) Security Council is charged with maintaining peace and security among countries. While other organs of the United Nations can only make 'recommendations' to member governments, the Security Council has the power to make binding decisions that member governments have agreed to carry out, under the terms of Charter Article 25.[7] The decisions of the Council are known as United Nations Security Council resolutions.

>The Security Council is made up of 15 member states, consisting of five permanent seats and ten temporary seats. The permanent five are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. These members hold veto power over substantive but not procedural resolutions allowing a permanent member to block adoption but not to block the debate of a resolution unacceptable to it. The ten temporary seats are held for two-year terms with member states voted in by the General Assembly on a regional basis. The presidency of the Security Council is rotated alphabetically each month.[8]

>The Security Council has been criticised for being unable to act in a clear and decisive way when confronted with a crisis.

So, given that we are one of the five permanent members of the security council, the U.S. gov. can veto any resolution it doesn't like; e.g., one that would potentially hinder its increasing power over the citizenry.  But this is all far fetched any how.  As far as I understand it, the UN is only an organized meeting ground for its member states.  It has no more power than the collective power of its members.  If the nations of the world have thus far been unable to keep us from perpetrating 2 unjust invasions of sovereign nations (and gearing up for a third) and from illegally detaining and torturing their citizens, then they aren't gonna be able to do shit about our own self-abuse.

If we don't rise up and correct this shit ourselves, we're fucked.  Short of an alien intervention, there aint no one coming from the outside to protect the free-wheelin', over-indulgent lifestyle to which we have become accustomed.

I just thought of a wonderful idea though regarding elections.  It would be pretty interesting if you could cast your vote for causes/views instead of candidates, and each candidate who supports a certain (winning) cause/view would receive those votes.  The candidate with the most number of winning cause/view referendums wins the election since they are the most complete picture of America's ideology as opposed to forcing America to decide for the lesser of multiple evils.  You vote for your views and causes and the candidates must choose accordingly to win.

This is of course just an idea and to actually implement it in any way, shape, or reasonable form would never happen in this politically charged and divided nation nor would it be that easy to convey to the people, the candidates, and the entire political system the benefits as opposed to the cons of such a systematic overhaul.

I was under the impression that it needed to be a single third party candidate, but if it's any and all of the third party candidates, then I have no problem for someone else voting for any third party candidate they choose.  But if not, I would feel obliged to encourage that person to vote for Gary Johnson (instead of someone else - at least this go around) since he has the highest probability of achieving the 5% benchmark on his own accord (which would help all of the other candidates and their parties in future elections).

Essentially, it would be a rally for the third parties uniting together for a single cause (of bringing more exposure to third parties in future elections for the sake of third parties) ignoring the separate ideologies of each third party for a greater good of future third party participation in mainstream dialog (which I think might be more important than the somewhat immeasurable effect of casting a vote for an obscure candidate this go around).

I honestly am not sure on the specifics.  While Gary Johnson may be polling better, I feel less attached to the Libertarian party than I do the Democrats. (Though I'd certainly prefer Libertarians over Republicans)

> Also, why Jill Stein? Can you make me a quick case on why she is a good presidential candidate or not?

http://www.jillstein.org/issues is the official site.  Personally, I am in strong agreement with her in the following sections: ""Worker Rights"", ""Civil Rights"", ""Voting Rights and Democracy"" (exception: I believe we can have auditable electronic ballots, but paper would be a step up from the status quo), ""Immigration"", and ""Criminal Justice"".  If she was in a debate with real candidates, I would love to see them squirm over trying to defend their actions in voting against so many of these areas.

My strongest area of disagreement with her is that her party is entirely anti-nuclear, despite the fact that it would fit in very well with many other parts of their plan.  I feel that their hatred of nuclear is as non-scientific as the Tea Party.

I also find that they have a few statements that seem almost... childishly hopeful.  Specifically mentioned, ""Forgive existing student debt"" seems like it isn't considering the outcome of doing so.  Don't get me wrong, I feel like the cost of education in the country is spiraling out of control, but that method of fixing it seems a bit short-sighted to me.",2012-11-01T12:31:17+00:00

Where is it not already this way?

Nuclear waste is a formidable enemy to the natural preserve.  We haven't figured out a good solution to properly dispose of and store nuclear waste material for the long-term.

The childishly hopeful statements come from every politician, but I find them more often on the left side of the political spectrum probably due to the idealistic nature of those political leanings.  For instance, what's hope and change.  It's idealism manifested incarnate as a catchphrase and political campaign slogan.  I find that many on the right are a bit more pragmatic, practical, or realistic and therefore less likely to include hopeful rhetoric (although it still definitely happens).  The bluntly rendered form of an intangible component to political rhetoric, quite possibly the antithesis of hope, that comes from the right is fear.  Where there is a lack of hope (out of realistic views), there is fear utilized to render votes.  Hope and fear are both motivators.  Hope is more positive, but less evocative.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Israel,k51n4f2,None,,"Repost from u/thoraway5029

Nuclear non-proliferation. A strong Israel keeps a lid on nuclear proliferation in its region (probably the region for which it is most critical to prevent proliferation). It was Israel that took out the Osiraq nuclear reactor in '81, preventing Saddam Hussein from acquiring nuclear weapons. They are the reason Iraq did not have nuclear weapons by the time of the US invasion. It was Israel that stopped the Syrian nuclear program in its tracks in 2007 with another targeted strike. Could you image what the Syrian Civil War would have looked like if Assad had not merely chemical but also nuclear weapons at his disposal?

Intelligence. Israeli intelligence agencies are second to none. In the last few years they have alerted western partners to attacks by the Islamic State on airlines in Australia, attempted assassinations and a bombing in Europe ordered by the Iranian government, a different ISIS plot to plant explosives in computers to pass through US airport security (you may remember Trump then unceremoniously burning the Israeli agent inside ISIS to the Russians), various intelligence coups related to the Iranian nuclear program and that's just what comes to mind at the moment and was released publicly. This has been going on for decades. Israeli intelligence warned the US about the September 11th attacks a month beforehand. In the cold war era there was a long history of Israeli agents passing the US everything from Soviet missile technology to the speeches in the Kremlin to a fully working MiG. And then there are the joint ops like Stuxnet, which leads nicely into my next reason.

Technology. Israel is Silicon Valley the country. It has the most startups per capita, the most engineers per capita and the most venture capital funding per capita of any country in the world. It is one of the world's leading countries in just about every technological area of vital interest to the US -- from drones to missile defense to cyber to artificial intelligence. Israeli and American technology is deeply entwined as well. There is no major American technology company I can think of that has not bought Israeli companies and doesn't have an R&D center in Israel (including Apple, Facebook, Google, etc...) Most of Intel's new processors in the last fifteen years were designed in Haifa. Israelis invented the firewall, the flash drive and the Iron Dome. The US military is rife with Israeli technology as well. The hi-tech helmet displays of the F-35, the system that protects tanks from RPGs and a dozen other items were pioneered by the Israelis and passed on to American soldiers. And it's not just access to the technology, the US also gets the ability to restrict who Israel sells its technology to. Did you know that Israel is the world's #1 seller of military drones. They're considered the best in the market. But they don't sell to China. Or Russia. Even though doing so would earn them a tremendous amount of money and they have no natural clash of interests with those nations. They don't sell to them because the US asks them not to. It might surprise you to know that the Israeli parliament has actually debated ending the American aid because they were confident they could earn more in increased defense sales than they receive. (Ultimately they concluded that the close ties to the US were considerably more important than what could be expressed in dollars and cents and dismissed the discussion.) Israel's engineering and scientific prowess often gets overshadowed by other news coming out of the region, but their technological rise is astounding. They also, I believe, have won the most nobel prizes per capita of any country in the 21st century.

Shared values. The US supports vulnerable democracies. It stands by Taiwan, by South Korea and it stands by Israel. Israel is a rare bright spot for things like democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, gay rights, women's rights in its region. You can certainly argue the merit of supporting democratic values, but for many Americans that is a factor in their support of Israel and helping to defend these values is seen as a worthy cause (and a boon for American soft power). And unlike the other American allies in the region, it is not just Israel's government but their population as well that feels a strong bond with and kinship towards the US. A change in government in a country like Jordan or Egypt or Saudi Arabia is likely to result in that relationship souring. That's not true in Israel.

Israel protects itself. There is a great deal of discussion on the aid the US supplies to Israel. But the US spends more than double that on the security of countries like Japan, South Korea and Germany, countries far wealthier and in far less danger than Israel. The difference? The US has to protect those countries with American lives. Israel is the only major American ally for whom American lives have not had to be risked in her defense. They won all of their existential wars fighting alone, generally considerably outmanned. This is impossibly rare in the world today.",2023-10-15T23:27:59+00:00

Israel does have its flaws but by and large it is multicultural society where 20% of its citizens are largely Arab, mostly Palestinian, who enjoy equal rights, vote, are elected to the Knesset, serve on the Supreme Court etc. 

This is not say that there aren't problems or flaws or serious race and cultural problems--- lord knows America is also guilty of that as well. But by and large they are society with which we share more common values. Also the US has the second largest community of Jewish people after Israel. Many Israelis live in the US and many Americans live in Israel. 

The US was not always as supportive as they have become it should be noted. From the beginning of the state of Israel to after the 67 war the US didn't really support Israel in any real way. A few verbal and vote supports at the UN sometimes but never any aid or weapons. During the Suez crisis the US was openly hostile to Israel even. And at times the US has supported the Palestinians. In fact, for decades the US and Israel were the primary financial supporters of the Palestinians and their government and were responsible for most of the aid that flowed into the territory.

After the second intifada in the early 2000s is when you see the dynamic really change. Despite Israel dismantling all settlements in Gaza and retreating, and coming up with peace deal after peace deal to be rejected by the Palestinians, and all the aid from the US and Israel to watch as then the Palestians had suicide bombers blow up school buses full of children or resturants multiple times a week for months and months, it really tapped the well of sympathy for the Palestinians dry.

Article 1

All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

Article 2

Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.

Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty.

Article 3

Everyone has the right to life, liberty and the security of person.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Palestine,k9594ws,Reina_Dela_Mar,,"In hindsight, I may have gone overboard but here’s my take:

The idea stems from intersectionality. That the world largely operates along similar ideas of power due to the legacy history (migration, colonization, industrialization, etc.) plays in the contemporary. 

I.e, poor people no matter what society still face disadvantage, women often face limited autonomy, queer and trans people may be alienated (not true in many Indigenous cultures but some, yes). But because these things are true, it provides the analysis of taking into consideration how people interact and are perceived in the world.

In the case of Palestine, queer and trans Palestinians may experience homophobia and transphobia, sure. But when your people have faced 75+ years of occupation and apartheid, your ancestral homes seized, generations of family that has lost their homes and faced violence, every person you know has lost at least 1 person to Israeli violence/mass incarceration. Homophobia just isn’t your priority.

Speaking for myself, I’m a trans girl whose also native and Latine. My transness is important to me. It informs me who I am. But my homelands, my people, my culture is the core of of who I am.

https://youtu.be/rbfccVBo9tE?si=cWaKpCqz6W-yTVnR

It's just a way for them to obfuscate their critics onto other targets like ""anti semites"" [meaning Jewish peace activists...] or in this case ""woke lgbt idiots"". 

But these people are actually protesting the **genocide** on Palestinians, not their gender equality laws or religion, but their right to just exist without occupation and terrorism of indiscriminate bombs that are slaughtering 160 children a day, 10 an hour, to the point doctors w/o borders has had to coin a new medical acronym WCNSF, ""Wounded Child No Surviving Family.""

 Zionism is a melting pot Venn diagram where Islamophobia, anti semitism, homophobia and racism can coexist just in one giant circle. You don't have to be Jewish to be a Zionist, or live in the area you just have to respect the hierarchy. Which is why a lot of conservatives rally around them to get their digs in and mock those minorities that they hate/ are phobic to.

Zionists are anti Semitic. Conflating all Muslims to radical violent Islam would be Islamophobic, and if you can't see that then you are one. The same goes if you do that to Jews.

Amazingly the non violent,  Jewish peace activists are getting suspended from colleges for being ""antisemtic"" by people accepting that definition from Zionists, whose nut job head of state is getting support and bombs while inferring scripture stating they have god given moral authority to ""kill every man, woman, child, suckling, goat and ass"" while he's bombing childrens hospitals.

Amerikkka is on full blast on international news, power and privilege falling down drunk with a megaphone.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Gaza,kwqwzfe,Kman17,,"While I’m neither Israeli nor Jewish, I have spent a bit of time in Israel for work.

Simple answer: there isn’t a singular opinion. Political thought in Israel is pretty diverse, and it’s a conscripted army that *everyone* participates in. It doesn’t have a political ideology that skews one way or another.

One thing is absolute: Israel values the lives of its citizens above all else. Deployment of the military is *not* taken lightly. It’s a small country where everyone kinda knows everyone.

I knew a guy who was a commander, and would get phone calls from Jewish mothers of his soldiers yelling at him to keep their kids safe.

You cannot underestimate how much of a violation it feels like to the Israelis to have their citizens taken hostage. I mean you say we as westerners get it, but like you don’t get it.

Similarly, every Israeli has it instilled to them just how persecuted their people have been historically. Most visit the European concentration camps. They all go to Masada (the ruins of an ancient Israeli kingdom where Jews were slaughtered in a last stand against Romans).

The road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem has a narrow passage to through the hills, there are still the remains of Nasser’s tanks turned into monuments.

People look at the map of Israel from 10,000 miles away and look at the split between Israel and Palestine, but forget the place is surrounded by a landmass bigger than the United States that’s hostile to it.

Like imagine if you lived in New Jersey and the rest of the continental United States declared war on you 3 times, then after that Delaware kept shooting rockets and detonating car bombs with the other states applauded.

That feeling easily forgotten by finger waving lefties with no appreciation for history more than 10 years ago, but it’s inescapable there.

Never again is drilled in pretty hard.

But all that said, it’s worth noting that ethnically, the Israelis and Palestinians look pretty similar. Many Israeli Jews are of middle eastern descent, and there are a number of Arab Muslim Citizens.

Contrary to propaganda all over Reddit and TikTok today, there isn’t some deep ethic or religious hatred. It’s purely political, and largely rooted in self preservation.

Some Israelis feel bad for Palestinians and advocate for leftist solutions, thinking they are reachable.

Many Israelis think they are simply ignorant religious fundamentalists with bad leadership in the same way that liberals look down on right wingers from the south… with the same frustration that the distrust and ignorance prevent working together.

Some are of course hawkish, thinking that their culture only knows violence and thus peace can only be secured militarily and by more land seizures to force them back to the negotiating table (and to have a chip to return to them).

It's pretty clear the military is *constantly* weighting the value in hitting a given target vs the risk to its soldiers and risk of blow back / collateral damage. Responses to the 2 decades of rocket fire were *really* measured. Assassinations of terror leaders, raids, seem to be the preferred approach. October 7th has undoubtably changed some equations though.

FWIW, I was there during the first time Gazan missiles reached Tel Aviv and got to watch the iron dome do its thing, then fly out right before the 2014 Gaza war. So I got that perspective live. My checkins with Israelis since Oct 7 has mostly been email.

But it’s all with noting that it’s an old culture in an old part of the world. They view the conflict over decades in the past, and decades into the future. There is not the same outrage of the moment liberal energy.",2024-03-27T03:11:05+00:00

They are not just of the same ethnicity as Gazans the way e see ethnicity in the West: We are talking about 2nd cousins.

Of course, I know this isn't true. I've worked with many high tech Arabs in the US and they are just as smart as everyone else.

The clear message I got in Israel is that they think of the Arabs as untermenschen, sub-humans that are inferior. About the most racist thing I have ever seen. I think that is how the military thinks of them too.

The IDF have made it very clear how they feel about Palestinian civilians. 

Was Hamas hiding behind human shields in 70% of Gazan homes? Not likely. Is it an understandable smart strategic limited operation by the Most Moral Army In The World™ when 44% of the dead are children? No, that is absolutely not supportable.

The attacks on October 7 were terrible but the death toll in this conflict has been so extremely lopsided and indiscriminate by the IDF, it is clear by now that the Netanyahu regime was just waiting for an excuse to wage genocide in Gaza. To reply, ""Well, none of this would've happened if Hamas hadn't attacked on October 7"" is neither a justification nor even really believable at this point. If October 7 hadn't happened, Netanyahu and the bloodthirsty genociders in the IDF who [steal money from Palestinian homes](https://www.newarab.com/analysis/how-looting-israeli-soldiers-gaza-widespread) and [pose with the lingerie of evacuated Palestinian women for selfies](https://www.newarab.com/opinion/iwd-israeli-soldiers-obsession-gaza-womens-underwear) would've found some other excuse for mass murder of Palestinians. 

Telling Gazans to move, exploding their houses, sniping children's skulls, telling them to move again, more death, more destruction, more killing of fleeing desperate Gazans, and [the final concentration camp in Rafah is their next target](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israel-plans-to-assault-gazas-rafah-despite-u-s-worries-8dbcb7a4). It's sick. It's genocide.

Israel is now not just the biggest danger to Palestine, but also the biggest danger to the Jewish people internationally. Genocide by the state that describes itself as the representative and safe haven for all Jewish people is the cause of the sudden spike in anti-Semitism internationally. Anti-Semitism is unjustifiable, and Israel is wrong to pose as the agent of the entire Jewish people. Israel has utterly failed in its stated mission to protect the Jewish people. For most of its existence, and especially now, it has only made being a Jewish person more perilous. Israel, by falsely presenting itself as acting on behalf of the entire Jewish people--most of whom are as blameless as the Palestinian civilians currently being slaughtered *en masse*--puts Jewish people across the world in far more danger from those who would wrongly put the blame at the feet of the Jewish people instead of the government of Israel. 

The IDF views Palestinian men women and children as less-than-human vermin to be exterminated. These are human beings who are being indiscriminately slaughtered, and the vast majority of the dead had nothing to do with Hamas. Judge the IDF by their deeds, not their words, not their slick propaganda operations and lobbyists. Meek milquetoast ""both sides, it's very complicated"" rhetoric obscures what is going on in reality right now. It's not a complicated ethical issue anymore, if it ever was. 

Now, I'm sure the hasbarists will attack the sources I've provided. Go ahead. Attack every news organization in the world, attack the UN, attack the EU, attack mild criticisms from US government critics, attack anyone who uses the right word to describe what's going on in Gaza, act so offended when they use the correct word, call them all Hamas, flail and clutch pearls while the world watches on in horror. It's not working anymore.

I weep for the Palestinian people, and I fear for the safety of my diaspora Jewish friends as Israel continues to falsely claim to represent the Jewish people's interests in commiting genocide in Gaza.",2024-03-27T02:49:58+00:00

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Gaza,kwzfce2,RealBrookeSchwartz,,"They see them as collaborators.

I have friends and relatives who have, or are, serving as IDF combat soldiers in Gaza during this war. The stories I've heard are things like:

* ""We went into a civilian home, and the children's book had cartoon images of Arab children with machine guns, intending to kill Jews.""
* ""So many of the civilian homes we entered had guns in them, or tunnel entrances inside.""
* ""Every civilian there is associated with Hamas. Every single home we entered had Hamas propaganda against Jews/Israel.""
* ""We went into a civilian home and there was evidence that hostages had been kept there.""

One of my friends collects some of the more ""interesting"" propaganda he finds—such as cartoons of dead Jews geared toward children, a map that can be found in every home that labels the entirety of Israel as ""Palestine"" and talks about ethnically cleansing all Jews from the region, etc.

Furthermore, returned hostages have recounted stories of being kidnapped by Gazan civilians, kept in the houses of Gazan civilians, being observed like zoo animals by Gazans off the street (including children), being tortured/beaten/sexually abused by Gazan civilians, etc.

The general consensus is that the social control of Hamas—especially when you factor in the lack of free speech—extends to every civilian in Gaza, and not only is everybody associated with Hamas, but most civilians are collaborating/cooperating to some extent and supporting terrorism against Israeli civilians. This is backed by polls.

Furthermore, on October 7, after the initial wave of Hamas terrorists, they were followed by a wave of thousands of Gazan civilians who spilled over the border and triumphantly raped (including gang rape), tortured, dismembered, kidnapped, and murdered hundreds of Israelis—including elderly, children, and babies in some cases. (Testimony from 10/7 revealed that rape in particular was very widespread, with victims, including elderly and children, having been raped so viciously that their pelvises broke.) Furthermore, multiple former hostages recounted being beaten badly by Gazan civilians who were parading in the streets (of which there were thousands) following their abduction.

Although many Israelis are sympathetic to the plight of Gazan civilians, many more just see them through the lens of people who supported or personally participated in October 7.",2024-03-28T17:27:07+00:00

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Gaza,kxxhgej,VampireKissinger,,"Israeli's see Palestinians as subhuman, my SO lived in Israel extensively and according to her, even ""Liberal Jews"" there would make the most racist American tell them to chill out.
According to her, there is a strict racial hierarchy

- Top - Ashkenazi Jews

- Mid - Mizrahi/Shepardi Jews. Now these would be considered lower, but actually make up the majority of the population, so technically hold most political power, but they are still seen as ""lesser"" than Ashkenazi Jews and a hidden part of Israeli history is that Shepardi and Mizrahi were subject to policies no dissimilar to The Stolen Generations in Australia, or Residential Schools in Canada up to the 1970s. Mizrahi and Shepardi Jewish children were often stolen from their parents and given to Ashkenazi Jews.

- Low (Basically Subhuman) - Ethiopian Jews. My SO said that the typical response from liberal Israeli Jews to them was ""Ew, why do they even exist?"" It wasn't a shock to her when they started limiting Ethiopian Jewish immigration.

Now according to my SO, she said here ""This is how Israeli Jewish people view eachother, imagine how they view non-Jewish groups""

- Subhuman Arab Israelis. Basically kept around as a token, are treated like absolute garbage and most of Israel is still heavily segregated with segregated neighbourhoods, businesses and schools. There was a book written by an Israeli Journalist who went undercover as an Arab Israeli, Here's what he said to the Chicago Tribune

>What does it feel like to be a Arab in Israel?

>I can sum it up in two words: humiliation and fear. I was scared all the time and humiliated because I was treated like nothing more than the continuation of a broom handle.

He was forced to sleep in a ""Slave Corner"", on a matress thinner than half a finger, was paid $10 for a 16 hour day and was forced to take a more ""Jewish"" sounding name 

>*“I was outraged. It wasn’t enough that the man was paying me starvation wages, and this his people denied me the right to even aspire to freedom and independence. He also had the effrontery to suggest thave up the little that remained to me, that I drop my name and assume the incongruous aspect of a Jew.”* 

During his work his boss once noted that, *“I see our Arab is a little idle, so let him take out the glasses and wash them over again.”*

- Should functionally be exterminated, Palestinians. Most Israeli's despise Palestinians and basically don't want to see them, and would basically wish they just disappeared. Polling backs this up, polling conducted in 2016, found that half of Israeli's openly supported ""complete"" ethnic cleansing against Palestinians and that rose to 75% for Religious Jews, and Palestinian/Jewish relations have only gotten far worse since then.

So Israeli's for the most part, are racist in a way most Westerners would struggle to comprehend and this absolutely extends to the IDF who have a long history of using rampant terror and rape as a weapon.

PoliticalDiscussion,post,West Bank,189bymj,anxiousnessgalore,What should Hamas's response actually have been with regards to the state of Gaza and the West Bank?,"We keep hearing about whether Israel's response is appropriate or not and that's the major discussion right now (imo it's way too much but that's a diff story). My question is, what should Hamas have done differently? Peaceful negotiations only go so far when one state doesnt treat you as equals anyway. We all know about how life has been in Gaza and the West Bank before the Oct 7th fiasco. Children were still getting arrested left and right in the WB, Gaza was still under a blockade, unemployment and poverty were extremely high, violence against them still hadn't stopped, and this has been going on for several years. The Great March of Return in 2018 was a completely nonviolent protest that was met with violence from the IDF, resulting in over 200 people killed. The founders of Hamas were orphans whose parents were killed by the IDF. Several members of hamas are also orphans because of the IDF. 

So I'm actually genuinely curious, what should/could they have done? Was there any way out of this? 

Historically, we have seen several oppressed people revolt violently as a response to violence and discrimination. The Warsaw ghetto, the Nat Turner revolt, hell even bombings during the suffrage movement. Today, would they all be considered terrorist attacks? In the end, they were actions that were part of a much larger movement. 

Straight quote from Wikipedia since I'm not well versed in politics: 

""In political philosophy, the right of revolution (or right of rebellion) is the right or duty of a people to ""alter or abolish"" a government that acts against their common interests or threatens the safety of the people without justifiable cause."" 

So yeah, what other options were there? And were they feasible? Would they have made a difference? What are your guys' opinions?",2023-12-02T20:09:33+00:00

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,West Bank,kbrp2bq,I_HATE_CIRCLEJERKS,,"What should the Palestinians have done better? The answer is many times exactly the opposite of what they did. 

1947: they should’ve not started a civil war to ethnically cleanse the Jews from mandatory Palestine. 

1948: they shouldn’t have allied with all neighboring countries to ethnically cleanse the Jews after Israel declared independence 

1948: they shouldn’t have heeded calls to flee Israel to clear the way for war on the promise of land and prosperity after the Jews were killed 

1948: Arab Palestinian militias shouldn’t have forced Arabs from communities near Jews in order to build military bases 

1950s & 1960s: they shouldn’t have encouraged the ethnic cleansing of Jews in all Arab countries leading to 1,000,000 Jews being forced to Israel’s doorstep, all property seized by Arab governments, who then had Israel welcom them and granted them citizenship after granting citizenship to all Arabs who stayed in Israel after the 1948 war with equal rights. 

1956: Palestinians (now annexed by Egypt and Jordan): shouldn’t have supported Egypt blockading Israel 

1967: Palestinians (now annexed by Egypt and Jordan): shouldn’t have supported Egypt blockading Israel 

1970: Palestinians (in annexed Jordan) shouldn’t have tried to overthrow Jordan’s government 

1973: Palestinians (now annexed by Egypt and Jordan): shouldn’t have supported every neighboring country declaring war to ethnically cleanse the Jews 

Early 1980s: Palestinians who fled Jordan shouldn’t have tried to overthrow the Lebanese government and start a long and bloody civil war

1980s-2005: Palestinians (now occupied by Israel) shouldn’t have tried to get Israel to end their occupation through years of brutal terrorist attacks on innocent civilians 

2006-2023: Gaza, after Israel unilaterally pulled out and evacuated settlements after multiple attempts to reach peace deals that would create a sovereign Palestine, shouldn’t have launched a decades long terror campaign to attack Israel with the intent to ethnically cleanse the Jews 

2023: the gazan government aka Hamas shouldn’t have tried to invade Israel and ethnically cleansed the Jews. 

Maybe after 76 years, Palestinians should stop trying to ethnically cleanse the Jews. Perhaps, and this will sound extreme to some of you, Israel doesn’t want to give the benefit of the doubt to people who have continuously tried to genocide them for almost a century. 

So what should Hamas’ response been? How about ending their intent to ethnically cleanse the Jews. How about taking one of the peace deals Israel offered. How about not stealing aid to build weapons and helping their people. How about stopping the terror campaigns that led to Israel blockading them so they can go fish. How about not tunneling into Egypt and launching terror attacks in the Sinai. How about not raising their children to hate Jews. How about not using human shields. How about not using civilian infrastructure as military bases. How about not targeting civilians. How about wearing uniforms. How about having an election. How about not using child soldiers. 

There are many things hamas could have done to get peace and help Gaza. Hama chose to do none of them and try to ethnically cleanse the Jews. I guess it’s just tradition at this point.",2023-12-03T03:22:24+00:00

Instead, they put a bunch of money into the pockets of their corrupt leaders, used a good chunk of the leftovers to build terror tunnels and launch rockets aimed at Israel's civilian population, spent a good portion of the rest on making big supporters/leaders of Hamas within Gaza multimillionaires, and dedicated the measly leftovers toward keeping their population in a permanent cycle of abject poverty.

If they had instead used this money to invest in serious infrastructure to get their society running, and had focused their efforts on maintaining a democratic government (instead of commencing a dictatorship in 2007), encouraging dialogue with Israelis, peacefully petitioning the Israeli government for a reduction in security measures as they continuously proved themselves to be nonviolent (instead of giving them more reasons to reinforce the border as they attacked civilians), and created a charter that focused on peace and coexistence instead of genocide and hatred, there would be peace, and likely Gaza today would be recognized as a respectable, sovereign nation and a close partner of Israel.

If they had done this, it's likely that Israelis would have felt more secure, and wouldn't have moved so far right in order to elect a government that made them feel safe. Bibi might not be in power, which would have changed the landscape in the West Bank, as well, as he in particular has a lot of incentives to stoke that flame.

The problem was never money. The 3 top Hamas leaders have $11 billion dollars between them; I read a few years ago that Gazans have received more than 25x in aid money per capita than Europeans did after WWII (and that was a few years ago). Hamas is absolutely flooded with money; you just don't see any of it because very little of it actually trickles down to everyday Gazan citizens. Iran alone gives $100 million to Hamas every single year.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Jerusalem,drl6ldn,tuna_HP,,"First of all, there is no question about whether Jerusalem or Tel Aviv is the capital of Israel in practice. Israel's Parliament, Supreme Court, Prime Minister's residence and offices, President's residence, etc., is all located in Jerusalem. Nothing is located in Tel Aviv. The question is not whether one or the other is the capital, the question is only whether the international community recognizes Jerusalem as such, or whether it submits to a ""diplomatic fiction"" that it is not the capital out of a deference to peace negotiations where the Palestinians want the Israelis to have to negotiate (e.g. give something else away) in exchange for Jerusalem being their capital. So the question about whether to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is about whether your country believes that Israel should have to ""pay"" the Palestinians for the privilege, or whether they should start the negotiations with it.

Secondly, the peace process wasn't exactly thriving under Obama either. Reputable polls of both Israelis and Palestinians show that the majority believe that there cannot be a peace agreement under current conditions. Some of the major obstacles include (1) the fact that the Palestinians are politically divided between Hamas and Fatah and the former is an internationally-recognized terrorist organization that explicitly plots in murder and terrorism, (2) the idea of a Palestinian ""right of return"" which the majority of Palestinians say that they subscribe to but which is logically equivalent to the destruction of Israel as a Jewish nation-state, so the Israelis obviously would never agree, (3) the division of Jerusalem where most Palestinians claim that they believe in dividing the city along the pre-1967 lines, which would leave the most important Jewish historical sites including the Western Wall outside of Israel, which Israel will never agree to, and (4) the Israeli settlements which are also across the pre-1967 lines which now house 400,000 Israelis in the West Bank besides another 400,000 in the Eastern areas of Jerusalem which Palestine also claims.

I see the Israel/Palestine conflict through the lens of **competing rhetorical framings**.

To simplify, the pro-Israel partisans generally frame Israel as 

* a tiny speck in the world
* a microscopic portion of the Middle Eastern / North African lands from which at least as many Jews were expelled as there were Palestinians expelled from Israel
* a small portion of the Greater Syria region of the Ottoman Empire
* Less than half of the historical Palestine region of the Ottoman Empire and British Mandate, which also included Jordan

Because of this framing of Israel, they can be resentful towards the idea that Israel is such a burden on the world, the region, or anyone. The way that they see it, if a Jewish nation-state was to be created anywhere in the world besides Antarctica, people were going to have to be displaced or made minorities in their own land. People already lived everywhere. That doesn't mean that it was an immoral project, because creating an avenue for a discriminated minority group to have self-determination and sovereignty has provided lots of benefits. Israel has taken in millions of refugees from all around the world, has created a thriving liberal society that has transcended all standards in the region, and has been gentler and more tolerant in the face of war, terrorism, and diplomatic enmity than pretty much any other country in history.

In contrast, the pro-Palestinian partisans see Israel through a much smaller frame. They only look at the territory of Palestine itself and see that Israel is occupying the whole thing and that even if Israel's 'occupation' of the West Bank were to end, that Israel would be left with 70% of the land. So they are naturally resentful of the idea of land swaps with Israel, because in their framing, they are already losing out huge by Israel existing even without the West Bank, so they cannot stand the idea of ""compromising on the compromise"" as they say.

Honestly I just think that there is too huge of a gulf in the perceptions of what is actually happening between the two parties. It is not a simple matter of ""just force the Israelis/Palestinians to do X"". They would honestly rather fight to the death than abandon the principles that they have which are tied to the respective ways that they frame the conflict.

I think that there is a scenario in which Trump's move to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and to work with Saudi and the other leading Arabs to recognize Israel would work. For example, if Obama had tried it, it might have worked. Obama's Iran deal was a monumental setback to the Gulf and they probably would have done anything in the world to facilitate Israel/Palestine peace if in exchange Obama would have scrapped it. Also, today's UN vote would not have gone the same if it was Obama in the White House. It won't work for Trump because he is too polarizing of a figure internationally and everyone wants to do the opposite of whatever Trump does just to stick it to Trump.",2017-12-21T21:07:22+00:00

Any attempts to punish other countries by cutting aid will also be short-sighted and a blow to US soft power.  Trump wasn't going to be restoring US greatness or credibility on the world stage the moment they made this move.

An article I read reported that they were finally saying 'Is the deal they get 2 years from now going to be better than the one then get today?

Trump simply doesn't understand the implications of this action. Someone close to him probably suggested it in order to further some part of their own ideological plan and Trump did it because he is easily convinced and doesn't want to put in any effort getting opposing opinions.


> Will it work out?

No it won't work out. This won't lead to peace, as it seems the U.S. is playing favorites in any current or future peace negotiation. The U.S. was already at a handicap in this regard because we've always been allies of Israel and this move just reaffirms that the U.S. cannot be trusted to be fair.

> Is the peace process recoverable under either this, or a future administration?

Maybe? In order for there to be peace both sides need to want it bad enough so that they are willing to compromise. They aren't there yet. Maybe they'll get there, but there isn't a huge incentive for Israel to give in to Palestinian demand. The U.S. can influence a peace but it is really unlikely that the U.S. can force a peace where the two parties involved don't want one.

What peace process?

•	The 1972 Munich Olympics massacre where 11 Israeli athletes were held hostage by Arab terrorists and lost their lives.  The financier of the operation was Mahmoud Abbas.

•	In 1982, Abbas wrote his PhD thesis entitled: “The Other Side: The Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism.” The topic was denial of the Holocaust.

•	While several Israeli prime ministers, including Benjamin Netanyahu have acknowledged acceptance of a ‘Palestinian’ state, Abbas has repeatedly said he will never recognize Israel as a Jewish state.  Demanding recognition of a Palestinian state while rejecting Israel’s right to exist proves he is not serious about peace. Most recently Abbas challenged Israel’s right to be recognized as a state by the international community saying it is “invalid.”

•	There are well over 1 million Arabs who live in Israel with full benefits of citizenship. They vote, own businesses, own property, are doctors, lawyers, professors, etc. They are elected to the Knesset and have even been members of the Supreme Court. They also have complete freedom of worship. There are mosques throughout Israel. Yet Abbas says not one Israeli [Jew], civilian or soldier will be tolerated in any future Palestinian state. Ironically, he’s accused Israel of being an ‘apartheid state.’

•	He is head of the Fatah Party. Their constitution calls for the destruction of Israel as a Jewish state. Can you imagine if Israel had similar statements regarding Arab Palestinians in its constitution? Where are the demands from world leaders and organizations for Fatah’s constitution to remove these statements?

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Conflict,k7vnfg5,pineappleonbagel,,"If we’re factoring in with what’s happening now imo I’d say quite a few things definitely need to change. I’ll start on the Israel side. 
1. Netanyahu need to go. This asshole and the government officials who are his Allies has been part of the reason why there’s been little progress to peace for quiet a while. https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/amp/ 
2. Settlers need to leave the West Bank. The settlers within the West Bank have been absolutely horrible to the Palestinians living there before the Hamas terror attack on 10/7. And Netanyahu completely supported the settlers going onto what’s considered Palestinian land for years.

Now for Palestine.

1. HAMAS. Do I need to say it? These fundamentalists assholes need to be completely destroyed. They are the other key reason why there’s little to no peace. Using civilians as shields, killing anyone who isn’t religious, wanting to kill every single Jewish person, the list goes on.
2. The radicalism. Quite a few Palestinians are quite anti semitic. Even the supposedly “moderate” PLO government is anti semitic with the President Abbas literally having a phd in holocaust denial  https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/mahmoud-abbas-still-a-holocaust-denier . And not to mention the martyr fund to kill Jews(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority_Martyrs_Fund ). There’s a reason why so many of their neighbors are refusing to allow Palestinian refugees in(Lebanon insurrection in the 70s, causing trouble to Egypt, trying to kill the Jordan king). Those things need to stop. 

My solution: I have no idea. Politics especially in the Middle East is complicated. What I do know however is this conflict is super complicated and neither side is free of blame.

Criteria for representative leadership would be (a) support from the majority of Gazans and (b) a commitment to a peaceful two-state solution. U.S. and global community ceases aid to Israel until the leadership of Israel also agrees to a two-state solution. U.N. moderates negotiations.

Even just recently leaders of Iran have stated that chants like Death to America or Death to Israel are not just mere throw away slogans to rally the masses but are official policy. 

So it's a complicated conflict with different players some at the forefront some in thinly veiled. But I would think any solution would have to require the removal of Hamas from Gaza. But I think the push to remove them cannot just come from the outside but must also come from within Gaza. The people of Gaza must work with outside forces to oust Hamas. They should be given guarantees that if they help remove Hamas that it will be worth the effort. There should be some negotiating what the rewards are for that effort. I would think that are people within Gaza that are tired of Hamas and tired of them hoarding what little resources there for them to attack Israel which in turn leads to a response from Israel and it's a never ending cycle. Time to break that cycle. 

If Hamas can successfully be rooted out then there's the issue of Iran. Iran needs to be sanctioned for supporting terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. Iran shouldn't be given the opportunity to just insert a substitute if Hamas is thrown out. Iran is one of the biggest instigators of conflict in the region and it needs to be clear it won't be tolerated any longer.",2023-11-05T15:36:48+00:00

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Conflict,k7vllcp,athelard,,"The Israelis are not interested in peace because they don't need it. The status quo benefits them. Their country is one of the the most innovative in the world, one of the richest per capita, and one of the most powerful on the region, besides being under the protection of the US.

By comparison, the Palestinians have one of the most underdeveloped regions in the world, in a big part due to Israelis interest in keeping their sworn enemy as weak as possible.

The negatives of the situation for Israel are close to negligible. The few rockets that were launched to them have never impeded their prosperity, and even the most devastating attack by the Palestinians, while tragic, killed a tiny percent of their population.

Meanwhile, they control all Palestinians, whether directly in the West Bank or indirectly through blockade in Gaza, and are free to take over the West Bank chunk by chunk via settlements.

It may sound like I'm biased against Israel here, but I am not, I'm just trying to be factual. Both sides have committed atrocities, but of the two, Israel is the least bad. First because they are 'only' stealing land slowly , while the Palestinians want to kick or kill the all immediately. Secondly because they gained control of the region after winning a defensive war. And third because their partial democracy with limited institutional racism is still much more humane than radical Islam government.

There won't be any everlasting peace until and if the balance of strength of the two changes. Perhaps all Palestinians get expelled and the conflict ends that way. Perhaps a disaster happens on Israel and they are forced to compromise with the Palestinians, think an attack by WMD. Perhaps Hamas manages to increase the damage they cause to Israel with the same effect of forcing concessions. Or perhaps in 500 the situation remains the same.",2023-11-05T02:35:08+00:00

Last year, after the Russian-Ukrainian war broke out, we saw a unified Democratic Party backing Ukraine and a divided Republican Party split on who to back. 

We are witnessing the exact opposite happen now. Now that Israel is bombing Gaza, we see a unified Republican Party backing Israel and a divided Democratic Party split on who to back. 

How will we see these wars impact the 2024 elections? Will Trump lose support for backing Russia? Will Biden lose support for backing Israel?

This is already a very tight race. Polls are showing Biden and Trump are neck in neck, if it comes down to those two at the end. The last thing either party wants is dampened support or people sitting out and not voting because of their party leader’s staunch support in controversial wars.

No.


Or, probably not


This was an increase in the pressure the Biden Administration is putting on Netanyahu, and a reminder that while the United States cannot compel Israel to do what they ask, there are multiple options between cutting off diplomatic relations and reflexive support in all things


Netanyahu chose to pull back a team heading to Washington in response,  which is... not exactly the end of the world from a US perspective 


Could things continue to escalate where there is a significant impact in the long term health of the relationship? Sure, but that is *mostly* going to be up to the Israelis.

You have long been a quality contributor to this subreddit. You have asked many insightful and well though questions on this subreddit for a period of many years. 


Obama and Netanyahu had a famously strained relationship. No foreign leader of an alleged ""ally"" in recent history has disrespected a sitting president more than Benjamin Netanyahu. I can only imagine how much worse Netanyahu's image became among veteran democrats after corruption charges and the passage of the Nationality Bill of 2018. John Kerry as secretary of state was highly critical of the Israeli right wing.


Biden has always known that the Israeli right was difficult to deal with. He witnessed it firsthand during his tenure in the Obama whitehouse. 


A key difference between the Obama department of state and Biden department of state is the role of Blinken, who has always given deference to Israel up until roughly January of 2024.


I do think the Biden department of state is starting to lose their minds a bit. There is only so much diplomatic coverage they can provide before things start to look ridiculous from even a domestic standpoint. ",2024-03-25T22:24:20+00:00

The PA must return to Gaza with Israeli & international support to oversee the security situation & eliminate the threat of rockets being launched into Israeli territory. The PA is the organization with whom the Israeli government is to negotiate a long term peace treaty & unless they retain control over Gaza, any future agreement will be worthless. Ceasefire negotiations at the end of Operation Protective Edge were initially geared toward seeing the return of the PA to Gaza, but an agreement along these lines was not achieved. It's difficult to overstate how important this objective is to long term peace & stability in the region.

At the same time, Israel has to take steps toward reforming its land management policies & deal with skyrocketing housing prices inside Israel proper, while eliminating unfair subsidies channeled to the settlements at taxpayers' expense. Settler interests have been taking advantage of an outdated & broken bureaucratic system that enables the transfer & sale of unregistered Palestinian land over to public management & private development without the consent of the Israeli or Palestinian people for more than 40 years. This is the same system that has driven housing prices to exorbitant levels for the newer generations of Israelis in recent history. In order for settlement expansion to end, this system needs to change.

Trump's inauguration will present Israeli leaders with a big opportunity to annex significant parts of the WB & E. J'lem without confronting effective opposition from US leadership, but their ability to succeed will depend in large part on two factors. First, Netanyahu's ability to maintain coalition stability. If left of center parties are able to gain electoral or coalition control in the coming years, the ability of fringe settler interests to curb the peace process will wane.

Roughly 2,500 Palestinian militants breached the Gaza–Israel barrier and attacked civilian communities and IDF military bases near the Gaza Strip.  At least 1,400 Israelis were killed.

While the outcome of this Israel-Hamas war is far from determined, it would appear early on that Hamas has much to lose from this war.  Possible and likely losses:

1. Higher Palestinian civilian casualties than Israeli civilian casualties
2. Higher Hamas casualties than IDF casualties
3. Destruction of Hamas infrastructure, tunnels and weapons
4. Potential loss of Gaza strip territory, which would be turned over to Israeli settlers

Did Hamas overplay its hand by attacking as it did on October 7th?  Do they have any chance of coming out ahead from this war and if so, how?",2023-10-22T17:56:32+00:00
PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Hamas,k60haa3,rzelln,,"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-was-hamas-thinking

I heard an NPR discussion with the journalist who authored the above article, wherein he interviewed a member of the Hamas political leadership (who is in exile in Qatar, not in Gaza). The guy said he did not know about the attack plans in advance, but he agreed with them.

The NPR conversation intrigued me (as did the New Yorker article itself) because the journalist clearly was struggling to understand how the hell people who are part of Hamas could think that the attack was going to turn out well for them. 

There was certainly some element of suspecting that the Hamas guy wasn't being totally honest. There's the stuff you say because it's your public rhetoric, but that doesn't necessarily represent your real motives. Like, not everyone who's involved in a terrorist organization is absolutely devoted to 'the cause.' Some -- hell, many, maybe -- are involved because they are seeking power and money, and if you say the right thing you can bamboozle angry people into giving you power and respecting your authority, even if they're going to end up dying. 

And you need to factor in the geopolitics of the situation. Like, as complicated as the internal politics of Israel are, and as complicated as the two-party conflict between Israel and Palestine are, and as complicated as the fissures between Hamas and Fatah are in Gaza and the West Bank . . . then you've also got regional players like Iran who have their own reasons for wanting to keep Israel in turmoil. So groups in Iran (and other states in the area, and hell, maybe even Russia and China?) finance Hamas, because as long as there's fighting and violence in Israel, it keeps the US distracted, which makes it easier for them to do whatever immoral chicanery they are trying to accomplish.

One theory for why the attack happened then is that, well, basically Hamas was desperate to try to remain relevant, to keep the money flowing in from Israel's regional rivals. With a few Arab states normalizing relations with Israel, and with negotiations ongoing between Saudi Arabia and Israel, there was the possibility that before too long, sentiment in the Middle East would shift away from them, and more folks who want a peaceful resolution instead of a violent resistance. And if that happens, people who enjoy being 'politically powerful' and enjoy skimming money from the funds going to Hamas would lose their gravy train.

But hey, guess what? You rampantly slaughter a thousand innocent people in Israel, and you can provoke a 9/11-esque rage retaliation, and now even more thousands of innocent people in Palestine are dead, and suddenly people who were maybe open to a peaceful resolution are going to have their anger stoked against Israel (and against anyone who supports Israel).

If Bibi Netanyahu weren't in power, and there was a more moderate coalition running Israel, maybe Hamas wouldn't have been so sure the retaliation would be so severe, so maybe there wouldn't have been a reason to try to start a war. But man, Bibi is pretty predictable, and so yeah, Israel feels threatened by the attack, and now Israel is actually provoking **more** hostility toward them, which puts them **more** in danger.

It's fucking tragic.

So you ask if Hamas overplayed its hand, and . . . I dunno, my take on the situation is that 'Hamas' has leaders who want something different from what the rank and file members want. The rank and file folks want Palestine freed. The leaders (at least some of them) want money and power. And so the leaders are willing to sacrifice thousands of the people whom they allegedly represent, because their goal is to keep the fighting going, so the money keeps flowing.

The winning strategy, I think, looks ridiculous if you are only looking at the conflict as ""Israel as a monolith versus Palestine as a monolith."" But if you look at the conflict as a bunch of foreign actors exploiting the greed and zealotry of various factions in Palestine in order to keep tensions high so that their geopolitical rivals are distracted, then (I think) the reasonable solution is to work **really** damned hard not to take the bait and kill a bunch of civilians, and to instead turn the public's ire at the puppetmasters.

And then of course, if you start that, you'll get accused of being soft on terrorists. It's like nobody learned anything from how America fucked up after 9/11.",2023-10-22T20:25:12+00:00

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Hamas,k60p9gs,tarlin,,"This is the issue with fighting a guerrilla or terrorist organization. Israel can blow up a lot of stuff. They can definitely kill more people, and I think Israel has killed more people every year. The backlash is the point. Hamas is supported by emotions when it is seen by the Palestinian people as they are being unfairly dealt with... So, when Israel goes for an extreme response, they are playing into Hamas' hands.

Ok, so here is the deal.

1. Hamas doesn't care about Palestinian civilian casualties.
2. Hamas is incredibly small, and probably pretty well hidden. Even if there are more casualties, it doesn't matter, because they cannot eliminate Hamas. Israel will not kill all of the Hamas people in Gaza, or even the majority.
3. Hamas doesn't really have anything. You can spend a ton of effort to destroy everything, but it is just water pipes, sugar, oil, and some amount of explosives. If you destroyed everything they had on hand, you are talking about tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars of goods. It is easily replaced. The tunnels are everywhere.
4. This will galvanize all of the ME against Israel, and multiple groups have said they will respond to that. It will probably happen, and Hamas will grow all the more powerful from it.",2023-10-22T21:12:59+00:00

They are determined to prevent the advent of any rational peace plan. Every new treaty that Israel signs with an Arab nation is seen as a betrayal by them, and something that they must stop at all costs. 

I think this particular action by Hamas has almost certainly been fomented and encouraged by Pootin in order to embroil America in a two-front situation. The more resources we are forced to pour into the Middle East, the fewer we will be able to send to Ukraine.",2023-10-22T21:33:04+00:00

Prior to the attacks, Israel was in robust discussions with Saudi Arabia to formalise relations (which is a massive deal in the Middle-East). A part of those discussions were Saudi Arabia's insistence on economic development for Palestinians. Whilst both Israel and the Saudi's agreed that a political solution for Palestine would be a future topic (several decades), at least improving the quality and opportunities for Palestinians was a step in the right direction. 

Hamas both fears any ME state or country formally acknowledging Israel nor do they frankly want the lives of Palestinians to improve because the entire premise of their mandate is the eternal struggle against Israel.

Since the attacks, the imagery coming out of Gaza is horrific and stoked the usual demonstrations throughout the ME (burning American and Israel flags etc.).

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Hamas,k60qsp3,TheOvy,,"I'm just going to cut and paste what I wrote about Hamas last week:

>Their entire goal is to keep a conflict going indefinitely, until some incredibly distant hypothetical future when the state of Israel itself is wiped out. Hamas does not care how many Palestinians have to die. And obviously, much like 9/11 did not give America cause for peace in the Middle East, but only war, Hamas knew that such an egregious attack on Israeli civilians would cause more violence. Hamas has been alarmed by the recent normalization of diplomatic relations between Israel and neighboring Arab countries, e.g. the Abraham accords. The Biden administration has recently been working to expand this process to Saudi Arabia. So in a bid to curry sympathy from these nations, and stymy any progress for Israel, Hamas staged last week's attack. And sadly, Israel is taking the bait, creating what is likely to be one of the worst humanitarian crises today in the Gaza strip.

As the Western world has loudly called for uniting behind Israel, so has the Arab world called for uniting behind Palestine. Hamas wanted to further the divide between Israel and the rest of the Middle-East, and it seems to be working. The Abraham accords were never popular with the people of the member nations, and now it's much more unpopular and perhaps even politically intractable -- yeah, Saudi Arabia ain't a democracy, but the leaders don't want to overplay their own hand, and trigger a revolt.

So no, I don't think Hamas ""overplayed their hand,"" at least not in their own minds. They're not fighting a strategic war that ends in a peace deal establishing the state of Palestine, they're fighting for publicity and provocation. I'm normally loathe to use the word ""terrorism,"" as it was so easily slathered over nearly any enemy of America in the 00's, but it's an apt term for Hamas. They're not freedom fighters, they're just assholes. They will never liberate Palestine, because they're not even trying to.",2023-10-22T21:22:37+00:00

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Hamas,k60r1z8,monkeybiziu,,"I think it depends entirely on the Israeli response, and how the US and Arab world responds to it.

If Israel shows restraint and doesn't carpet bomb Gaza into oblivion, if Bibi is replaced with a more moderate leader, if normalization with the Arab world continues, then there's a future where the two-state solution becomes a reality and Hamas is left with an angry populace and no support, which could result in Hamas eventually becoming irrelevant.

If Israel decides there's only one solution to Hamas and that's ethnic cleansing, and the US backs it, that's the ballgame. The Arab world will go to war, there may be a limited nuclear exchange, and that's World War III.

If Israel overreacts, and the US says ""Nah, you're on your own."", they may reconsider what they're doing and do something less egregiously stupid.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Hamas,k61vk1j,Equivalent_Alps_8321,,"HAMAS issued repeated warnings about what the Israelis have been doing in recent years with the raids on holy sites and never ending blockade of Gaza and the continued occupation and colonization of the West Bank. You may not think they're rational but to them it's probably the only choice they have to stop the slow genocide of their people. Israel is slowly taking over all of Palestine, that's clearly their govt's long term goal. You can't expect a nation to be occupied and a people oppressed for 50+ years and none of them will fight back. Some people choose violence. Not everyone is MLK. 

A good analogy is the Native Americans in this country who were wiped out through disease and war, killed and conquered and then put onto shitty reservations (the inspiration for concentration camps). Their people and culture slowly being erased by settler Americans who thought all of the land and resources was their birthright. Often the Native Americans would lash out and conduct brutal raids on these people who oppressed them. Sometimes even start full blown wars and they had some success but ultimately they had no chance. 

Israel especially under the psycho right wing govt's is not a good faith actor. Netanyahu is not a good guy. They have been the main block towards progress and resolution of the issue for many years. And it's clearly because they want all of the land for themselves and to remove the Palestinians completely. 

It's true that Israel were the victims for many years, they were attacked by the Arab nations multiple times. But that was a long time ago. The situation is reversed now. Ultimately I don't see any resolution ever happening unless the U.S. stops blindly supporting Israel and giving them cover to act with impunity including in clear long term violation of international law. I mean they were about to starve to death everyone in Gaza until Blinken and Biden went to the Middle East and talked to them.

I expect Israel will try to remove the Palestinian people from Gaza entirely now. But they're surely walking into a well laid trap and could be ensnared there forever in a guerilla war/insurgency. If they invade Gaza it's very possible other countries and groups will get involved to help the Palestinians.",2023-10-23T02:09:07+00:00

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Hamas,k61cnyp,jethomas5,,"They knew that after they killed Israelis, Israel would kill 10 to 50 times as many Palestinians. 

The Germans proved that approach worked in their occupation of France. They announced that for each German killed, they would kill 10 French people. Not exactly random French people, often it was people in jails who were easily available and sometimes dissidents. But more-or-less-random people. 

And that approach worked for just about 4 years, the time that Germany occupied France. When the Germans were retreating then the French resistance got busy. Their sabotage of railroads and trucks etc mattered more than killing individual Germans, but they did a fair amount of that too, once they thought the Germans had higher priorities than revenge.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oradour-sur-Glane_massacre    
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulle_massacre    
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Waldfest

There were only scattered reprisals, so on the whole the French did not overplay their hand.

The tactic worked for the Germans, why doesn't it work for Israel?

One possible reason is that the Germans announced ahead of time that they would kill 10 Frenchmen for each German dead, and later they announced 50:1. Israel does not publicly announce that this is their policy. But Palestinians know it is, and the reality ought to matter more than the words. So that probably doesn't make much difference.

Another is that the policy worked for the Germans for 4 years, while the Israelis have been attempting it for -- depending on how you count -- 70 years, or 58 years (founding of PLO, with palestinian civilian support) or 46 years (first intifada). Maybe the French just hadn't had time for it to sink in.

A third is that while the Germans had an open policy of death to untermen, intending to replace them with Germans, they considered French people to have enough German blood to be marginally acceptable. The French could easily have believed that Germans did not intend to genocide them. But Palestinians have no reason to think that Israelis have any place for them. They are squeezed into increasing poverty, with the general understanding that the only thing that stops Israelis from genociding them is the effect on world public opinion. So they surely believe they have less to lose than the French believed during WWII. 

During WWII, the people of the Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw tried to cooperate with the Germans. But when it became clear that they were heading toward total destruction, they tried to get weapons and fight back. They delayed the destruction by a month. The Germans brought in artillery and shelled the whole place, using some chemical weapons, and so around 13,000 Jews were killed in the fighting, along with 17 Germans killed and close to 100 wounded. Then the Jewish survivors were sent to the camps. 

""Marek Edelman, the only surviving ŻOB commander, said their inspiration to fight was ""not to allow the Germans alone to pick the time and place of our deaths"".

>In the days following Pompeo’s visit to Israel and Gulf kingdoms, a series of subsequent events suggest further planning for US (or US/Israeli) military action against Iran:On November 21, two US Air Force B-52 heavy bombers from the 5th Bomb Wing, based at Minot Air Force base, N.D., flew on a round-trip flight to the Persian Gulf in [what was described](https://theaviationist.com/2020/11/21/u-s-air-force-b-52h-stratofortress-bombers-conduct-short-notice-long-range-deterrence-mission-into-middle-east/) as a test of America’s ability to project additional firepower into the region on very short notice.On November 25, Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller made an unannounced visit to US forces in Bahrain, his first trip overseas after being appointed to that position on November 9, after Trump fired Mark T. Esper (who was deemed insufficiently loyal to the president). Although Miller’s Thanksgiving [visit was said to be a morale-boosting event](https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/acting-defense-secretary-meets-with-troops-in-middle-east-as-pentagon-begins-presidential-transition-1.653372) for US troops stationed abroad, he also met with senior officers at Centcom, whose forces would play a key role in any military action taken against Iran.On November 27, just hours after the assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the aircraft carrier *Nimitz*, along with its 70 or so combat aircraft and accompanying cruisers and destroyers, [sailed into the Persian Gulf](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/11/28/nimitz-back-in-persian-gulf-iran-vows-revenge-for-killing-of-nuke-scientist/). Although the move was said to be related to US troop withdrawals from the region, it was seen by some as unusual, as the Nimitz had been at sea for several months and was scheduled to return to its homeport in Bremerton, Wash.At about this time, the IDF [went into their highest state of readiness](https://breakingdefense.com/2020/12/us-israel-readying-for-iran-strikes-in-mid-east/) in anticipation of revenge strikes by Iran in retaliation for Fakhrizadeh’s assassination.On December 2, the State Department began reducing staff at the US Embassy in Baghdad, [supposedly in anticipation of possible attacks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iraq-baghdad-embassy-tensions-iran/2020/12/02/79141136-34c3-11eb-9699-00d311f13d2d_story.html) on the embassy by Iraqi-based militias loyal to Tehran.

And from the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/12/01/iran-will-lose-the-battle-but-win-the-war/):

>Tehran has historically relied on the presence of U.S. forces in the region to reinforce its deterrence capabilities, but the Trump administration has suggested it may withdraw its forces from Iraq and Afghanistan. This would diminish Iran’s ability to strike U.S. forces, and with that its ability to deter an attack. According to sources close to the Iraqi leadership, a number of militia leaders in Iraq, together with their patrons in Tehran, are convinced the Trump administration is seeking one last chance to settle its disputes with Iran, and that an attack will materialize if troops are withdrawn. These sources have noted that some militia heads have effectively either gone into hiding or have dramatically reduced their public engagements in anticipation of a potential decapitation campaign aimed at Iran-aligned groups in the region.",2020-12-12T23:13:35+00:00

Trump's number one most important objective is to stroke his ego and leave a ""legacy."" His indifference regarding the lives of US troops and innocent Iranian civilians is of course unsettling, but Trump is a narcissist so it is not surprising.  

But what Trump knows will happen if he starts a war with Iran (which would likely spiral into a much greater war) is that he will lose a lot of support. Support is what Trump breathes off of. Trump doesn't recognize the world outside his bubble. And so as his bubble shrinks, he will feel lost and trapped. This is what Trump fears most. That one day he will wake up disgraced, alone, and remembered as the man who started a devastating war during a global pandemic. The man who neglected the cries of his citizens to pursue military action that will only hurt us more. 

This... this is why I don't think Trump would strike Iran without support. 

Trump needs to hold on to whatever positive reputation he has left if he wants to continue impacting US politics and potentially make another run for office. Obviously, it has been dwindling. Now, he is more desperate than ever.

On the other hand, there's been talk that the US would no longer automatically be shielding Israeli activities from international condemnation at the UN since Netanyahu came to the US to denounce Obama led negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. In this regard, the decision not to protect Israel at the UN is a symbolic punishment for Israeli attempts to undermine US foreign policy initiatives in recent years.

To be sure, there is already an international consensus that views settlement activities as an impediment to peace negotiations. The recent decision not to veto UN condemnation fits in with long-standing US policy & while it may break with unconditional support of Israel in that venue, it does not go anywhere near the lengths that some have been calling for in the past several years.

*****************
If Mr. Trump decides he cares about this (and remembers) he might make a series of overt gestures explicitly intended to insult Palestinians and support Israeli settlement.

The most obvious would be following through on his promise to move the US embassy to Jerusalem.  For added ""screw you"", he could make sure it's in East Jerusalem, not the western part.  Or he might just start tweeting about how fantastic settlements are and how much he supports ""development"".

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Settlements,dbl9s2a,fireshighway,,"The question you're looking for is not what it says about US-Israel relations, but what it says about Obama-Israel relations. President Obama decided to align with the rest of the world and condemn Israeli settlements, which were already illegal under UN law. Honestly, the decision to abstain from the vote and let it pass is not controversial anywhere else besides the US and Israel.

However, none of this matters as Trump's policies and appointees are outspokenly pro-Israeli. David Friedman, Trump's Ambassador to Israel, is extremely pro-settlement, to the point that it is possible that the US could change it's stance on the issue to a one-state solution. I honestly think it is somewhat likely that the expansion of settlements in Israel by its conservative government, combined with US support for settlements and moving the embassy to Jerusalem, could lead to a Third Intifada, or at least an exponential increase in violence and tensions in the West Bank in the near future.

The criticism by US politicians is mostly focused on the idea that the UN has disproportionality been used as an instrument to punish Israel. It's possible that with a Trump Administration that is vastly under-qualified in foreign affairs, staunch anti-UN politicians like Lindsey Graham may see this as their golden opportunity to pull US support for the organization through legislative means.

Personally, I think this move by Obama is extremely weak and too little, too late. If Obama wanted to make an impact on US-Israeli relations the US should have voted this way two or three years ago. Now the vote literally does not matter at all. It may be the most certain policy stance Trump has taken thus far. However, when it comes down to it I think Samantha Power made a great point yesterday during the vote. You simply cannot simultaneously champion a two state solution and Israeli settlements. By doing so, the Trump Administration will likely worsen the political situation in Palestine, and at best do absolutely nothing to help the peace process. ",2016-12-24T20:08:54+00:00

Personally, I support a unified one-state solution, but the Palestinians need to get their shit together to make it happen. The real concern of a bunch of Israelis is that either giving Palestinians their own nation or reintegrating them in poorly will lead to blood in the streets. Hamas has fueled violent opinions against the Jews and Israelis are feeling betrayed that now even the US is willing to let Hamas attack Jews in the streets again.

Brazil has already mobilized at its northern border, so chances are they won’t allow Venezuela to go through them. In that case, their only option is to go through the Guyana border, which is heavily dense forest, so the terrain conditions would be bad and they’d run into Guyana’s first line of defense - snakes and jaguars and other wildlife.

In the unlikely event they get past all that, the US isn’t going to stand for a country in the Western Hemisphere engaging in a war of conquest. They’ll potentially get involved and finish the war in a matter of days. B-2’s from Whiteman AFB could make it to Caracas and back without refueling pretty easily. Other countries like the UK could also potentially get involved, given the history of the area. 

But that being said, if a war does break out, others countries will likely have to come to Guyana’s aid in a military form. That is, if they care about Guyana at all.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Annexation,kcaxc82,jad4400,,"The consensus here is that Venezuela won't attack and would be in a poor position to. I want to play devil's advocate here (using Wikipedia links for basic info):

First of all, indeed, the terrain of the Guyana Esequiba isn't the most conducive to a ground invasion, it's heavily rainforested and has little infrastructure in the area. One of the only roads into the province from Venezuela goes through Brazil, with the only other feasible way of moving large numbers of folks in is either via air to a clearing in the area or by sea. All of this is true. However, a couple of factors can work for Venezuela here.

1. Guayana Esequiba is a large and very sparsely populated area. Its 159,500 square kilometers make it twenty percent larger than Greece, thirty percent larger than the island of Luzon in the Philippines, twice as large as Portugal, or just slightly larger than the US state of Georgia. Meanwhile, the largest city in the region is the city of [Bartica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bartica), which had more than 8000 people living in it as of 2012. Of the (in 2012) 747,844 people who lived in Guyana, only 128,104 lived in the Esequiba, less than twenty percent of the population. Breaking it down further, of all the [administrative regions of Guyana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regions_of_guyana) that reside in the Esequiba region, almost sixty percent live in the two coastal regions of [Barima-Waini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barima-Waini) and [Pomeroon-Supenaam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pomeroon-supenaam). Why do I bring this all up? Because realistically, most of the oil resources Venezeula is after are off the coast of Guyana, so if Venezuela wanted to move to calm the region, realistically, they'd just need to insert enough troops along these two northern regions to size control. If they can wrestle control of the coastal regions that give claims to the oil, the rest of the province more or less becomes just a matter of picking off or leaving to go after slowly, which brings me to point 2.

2. The [National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_bolivarian_armed_forces_of_venezuela) isn't a world-class military. No one on here will dispute that; I've already seen plenty of jokes about how one of the naval ships lost to a cruise ship in a game of chicken a few years ago. It's true it's not the strongest military on the planet, and given how poorly the Venezuelan government has been running the past few years, who is to say how much is still functional? However, even if it only functions at half strength, that still puts Venezuela's armed forces multiple folds ahead of [the Guyana Defence Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guyana_defence_force). Guyana, on its best day pulling in its reservists, can field 8000 soldiers and give them a few dozen armored cars, some small arms, and a few mortars and MANPADS. Its navy is a few old small patrol boats, and its airforce is a couple of Bell helicopters and a couple of transportation planes. Venezuela can field a brigade the size of the entire military of Guyana, its air transportation arm is several times larger than the entire number of air assets of Guyana, and unlike Guyana, Venezuela has combat aircraft that can conduct strikes. It also has several small amphibious landing craft to shuttle troops along the coastline. Obviously, the million-dollar question is, how effective would all this really be given Venezuela's endemic corruption and poor governance? Even if the force, let's arbitrarily say, was only half effective, that still leaves an army with significantly more personnel and a navy and airforce with considerably more assets than Guyana. That's not even counting the massive militia force Venezuela also has; considering how sparse the population is spread out in Esequiba, you wouldn't need much to hold it if you pop in a squad or two of guys with rifles in larger villages to push around people who won't accept your rules. If Venezuela uses its army, it'll probably be economical with the good stuff. This is especially true if Venezuela attempts to grab the valuable coast and slowly worm its way into the interior. Which sadly comes to point 3.

&#x200B;

3. Will the world care? Yes, the Monroe doctrine has been tossed around a lot, but consider this. Publically, Venezuela is insisting that this region belonged to them and was only removed due to an unfavorable treaty arbitrated in a corrupt ruling between the UK, The US, and Imperial Russia. Consider the moves Moduro has taken so far, holding a sham referendum and insisting that companies extracting oil must comply with Venezuelan law. Internationally, this is playing into the decolonization rhetoric across a lot of the world. Consider, too, that sanctions against Venezuela were lifted in part to try and open a new avenue of oil for the world to use to get folks off of Russia's oil. If conflict comes into Venezuela, will this impact the global oil markets? Right at the same time, renewed incidents on the high seas are happening in the Red Sea, one of the vital oil linkages for the world. As much as the US doesn't want Venezuela acting imperialistically and annexing Guyana's land, would it risk a disruption to the global oil market at such a time when support for Ukraine is facing issues in Congress? Would it risk market disruptions less than one month from the Christmas holiday, when if an economic downturn struck the global economy, people would bitterly remember it at the polls in less than a year? This is the calculus politicians will have to consider if it's worth it to wade in if it turns out Venezuela is more than talk on this.",2023-12-07T00:36:57+00:00

Venezuela also can't invade by land without going through Brazil so any attack would have to come from sea/air with logistic lines running by ship.

If there is no FI, very little military intervention would happen as the economy of Venezuela is shot and the  infrastructure in wester Guyana is non-existent. So if Venezuela tries to fight, it would be like fighting in Vietnam with a badly organised underfunded military.  i.e., dense forest little to no supply and inability to sustain a long-term war.

If their is FI it would be effective very bad for Venezuela they are already suffering economic crisis, hyperinflation, mass exodus of people, and sanctions. It would cause Venezuela to most likely become the North Korea of the Americas with no nuclear weapons I.e. a very bad time for the country.

*However* it must be noted that the reality is very different Venezuela most likely won't invaded (even the same thing was said for russia) because it doesn't have actual popular support. It is well known that the current President of Venezuela is openly disliked by his people as he is blamed for their woes. 
So it could be argued that the vote was rigged or is atleast being used as way to subvert the future Venezuela elections. It will give the President of Venezuela an excuse not to hold elections. As he tampered with the prior elections.

So my guess is that it is just a excuse to try and hold on to power longer with no interest in actually war.

But as the conflict has gotten to a point where the blood of so many innocent is being spilled, why couldn’t the UN basically occupy disputed lands? Have a forced neutral lands that is governed through direct UN/neutral mediation, where all those who live there vote on policies to govern the land. This would prevent policies from being passed by a majority to target others and it would be policed by neutral parties until both sides can be trusted to cooperate to some degree. 

It seems that neither side will back down and so many people are caught in the crossfire, so would the idea of a neutral governance lead to the least loss of life? The land is deeply rooted in both cultures, that both won’t stop until they remain in control. Neutral Occupation would not make either side happy, but it would stop bloodshed until concessions could be made.

There hasn't been centuries of bad blood between these groups. The conflict is fairly new. The Palestinians want citizenship in a state, and the Israeli state wants to prevent because it wants the land the Palestinians live on and hopes to expel the Palestinians from that land because it fears that otherwise the Palestinians will wind up citizens of Israel and thereby threaten Israel's Jewish majority. That's the cause of the bad blood, and it really doesn't date back much further back than 1947 or so. The two main groups involved (Ashkenazi Jews) and Palestinians didn't really live in the same area for nearly 2000 years before that, and they are largely descended from the same ethnic population of Canaanites. (Presumably many of the Palestinians' ancestors were Jews who later converted to Islam.)
The reason the UN won't get involved is because the US supports the Israeli position because Israel is useful as an ally in an oil-filled region. This is also reinforced by anti-muslim racism and by the fact that Americans don't understand the enormous power asymmetry between the two groups (a militarized state vs. a population of refugees) and so assume that they are just two equal parties who cannot get along.",2023-12-25T23:33:50+00:00

>“There weren’t enough soldiers; there weren’t enough capabilities,” [said Eyal Hulata](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/27/hamas-attack-israel-october-7-hostages/), the head of the country’s National Security Council from 2021 to 2023. “The first line of defense became the last line of defense, and this should never happen. Israel knows that.” 

[Two days before the attack](https://www.timesofisrael.com/2-commando-companies-said-diverted-from-gaza-border-to-west-bank-days-before-oct-7/), Israel moved two companies from the Gaza border to the town of Huwara.

Huwara is the site of what the Israeli commander in the area called a [pogrom](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/15/middleeast/huwara-west-bank-settler-attack-cmd-intl/index.html):

>“We did not prepare for a pogrom on the scale of dozens of people who come with incendiary devices… they go and set fire to random Palestinian houses, vehicles, etc. – simply indiscriminate terror,” - Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fuchs

The IDF was assisting in the destruction of Huwara so that it could be taken by Israeli colonizers.  That priority came above Gaza.  Even the Israeli Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, weighed in saying “Huwara needs to be erased.”  

Israeli has within itself the ability to prevent incursions from Gaza. The IDF weren't powerless; they were overconfident, arrogant, and aggressive.

BTW, Biden doesn’t like Netanyahu. For Biden, Netanyahu is just a trouble maker that the US must be careful about words and actions. The war can start at anytime. Starting much earlier, or after the election is better, but not now!
The US has two traditional allies in mideast, which are Saudi Arabia and Israel. Now you see, Saudi is going away although they must rely on the US weapons and military resource. Too many reasons for both sides, and I would say the relationship is just average, neither going bad or good. Israel is much wealthier, intelligent and energetic.

First, American relations with Israel -- and pretty much every country in the world -- are reset every 4 or 8 years.  As soon as Biden is out of office, the new president will be able to establish his/her own relationship with Israel.

Second, the UN constantly passes resolutions condemning Israel.  Condemning Israel is a cottage industry in the UN.  [In 2023, the UN general assembly passed 14 resolutions condemning Israel, including 3 on one day in December 2023](https://unwatch.org/un-general-assembly-condemns-israel-14-times-in-2023-rest-of-world-7/).  The UN passed 7 resolutions condemning anyone else in the rest of the world.  So the UN passing resolutions against Israel is just business as usual.  

However, these UN resolutions have roughly the same effect as the [Sacramento City Counsel passing a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Israel](https://www.kcra.com/article/arrests-sacramento-city-council-meeting-mayor-cease-fire-resolution/60250759).  It doesn't mean anything.  Neither Israel nor Hamas are bound -- or even affected by -- these resolutions.  They're political theater.

Third, all international relationships are based on self interest.  Biden is supposed to look out for the US's interests, and Netanyahu is supposed to look out for Israel's interests.  To the extent those interests are different, neither party is supposed to defer to the other.

No, primarily because it also demanded the return of all hostages, which is a better deal than the one currently on the table.

Casualty figures are coming from Hamas who were claiming ~30 - 40,000 fighters before the war, but suspiciously there have been no fighter deaths according to their figures, only civilians. 

Their southern brigades have been wiped out, ~20,000 fighters, and whatever remains fled to Rafa to continue the use of the population as human shields.

Getting aid in is next to impossible. I have colleagues on the ground, and we've had to pull them out multiple times due to Hamas stealing aid supplies at gun point or worse. Most of the aid agencies are using Mercs to evac or protect their staff.

The situation on the ground is horrifying by any dimension, especially as Hamas fighters continue to launch attacks from the camps, provoking reprisals.

Politically, Netanyahu is gone - his whole argument was security and the October 7 attacks exposed Israel as weak and unprepared. There have been regular street protests calling for his departure ever since. 

Israel will invade Rafa - they have no choice - Hamas will go back to underground terrorism as they did in the 1990s, and Israel will continue to face a militarised Gaza if that is allowed to happen. Their population was seeing ~4000 attacks a month before hostilities broke open, so you can imagine sentiment in Israel.

My honest opinion is that there will NEVER be a two-state solution and only a one state solution. You turn the whole region into one giant state and give Palestine special representation in the parliament such that they have a veto but you maintain a check by ensuring the veto must be unanimous. Give them a number of vetos per term. IE. 4 vetoes per term. ",2016-09-19T15:05:26+00:00

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Two-state solution,d7tm1h9,tuna_HP,,"1. **The Two-State-Solution remains as viable as it ever has been and more viable than most times**. What do I mean by that? I mean that between 1948 and 2002, the Arab leaders maintained that they were completely opposed to peace with Israel on any terms and would continue to work only towards the complete elimination of Israel. In 2002, the Arabs submitted the Arab Peace Initiative which for the first time allowed that they would make peace with Israel under certain unrealistic terms, but it was a step forward as the first time the Arabs ever signaled that they would be willing to come to any agreement, 2 state or otherwise. So as far as any peace agreement, 2 state or otherwise, is possible, that's only been the case since 2002 due to Arab intransigence. As to the issue with the settlements, there's no compelling argument as to why they would be an obstacle to a peace agreement. First of all there is no logical or moral basis for creating Palestine on exactly the pre-1967 borders, neither Israel nor the Arabs nor the international community has ever agreed to this. Second of all, 2 million muslim Arabs live as full equal citizens of Israel, it would only be fair for some Jews who are really passionate about it to live as full equal citizens of Palestine.
2. **The mainstream narrative regarding the Israeli occupation is extremely biased against Israel** The way you hear it covered in the news I don't blame my friends and acquaintances for being under the impression that: ""There was a state of Palestine and Israel wanted more territory so they conquered Palestine and stole their land"". In reality, last region that officially bore the name ""Palestine"", the Ottoman Province of Palestine that turned into the British Mandate of Palestine, consisted of the territory that today includes not only Israel and the occupied territories but also all of Jordan. So out of the original Palestine, the British first created a muslim Arab state called Jordan and gifted it to their Hashemite warlord partners. Jordan is 75% of the land area of Palestine. What people are really talking about with regards to the contemporary Palestinian national movement is creating a ***second*** muslim Arab state out of Palestine, so that there would be one Jewish state occupying maybe 15% of Palestine and two Arab states occupying the other 85% of Palestine. Additionally, it was the Arabs who started the war that forced Israel to conquer the West Bank, and even more than that, the Israeli leadership had been desperately trying to keep Jordan out of that 1967 war because they greatly feared a Jordanian armored thrust through the center of Israel. The Prime Minister of Israel kept calling the King of Jordan and promising him that Israel would not attack the West Bank / Jordan as long as he stayed out of the war. In the end the King of Jordan had an impossible choice to make because if he *didn't* join the Arab coalition against Israel, he feared that his own people would rise up against him. So he joined the Arab coalition and put the West Bank in play. So the Arabs forced Israel to conquer the West Bank and then would not agree to a peace deal until at least 2002. If another country forces you to control land from 1967 to 2002, you shouldn't be held criminally responsible for developing that land. That's on them. Like imagine if someone forced you to take ownership of a house in the suburbs, and while you owned that house you continued to have to pay taxes on it and continue to keep it up to the standards of the neighborhood (my analogy to the costs that Israel incurs securing the West Bank) and imagine that the people who forced you to take this house also were preventing you from selling the house back to them or to anyone else.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Negotiations,k3sr12n,socialistrob,,"The problem with a “negotiated peace” is that both sides have to agree to it. What is currently palatable to Russia is in no way palatable to Ukraine and vice versa. Ukrainians also believe that Russia will break their word at a moment’s notice and that Russia will just use any “peace” to rearm and then attack later. They also believe that Ukrainians living in occupied regions are at extreme risks of genocide. Whether or not you personally believe these things is irrelevant but what matters is that Ukrainians believe them which makes any peace negotiations extremely difficult.

Right now the closest thing to a negotiated peace would probably be Russia withdrawing from all of Ukraine and returning kidnapped Ukrainians and in return Ukraine would not insist on reparations or the prosecution of war criminals. That MIGHT be palatable to Ukraine but Russia would not agree to that unless the military and economic situation worsened dramatically. Russia’s minimum “negotiated peace” would probably call for Ukraine to retreat from the current lines and hand over more land including all of the Donbas, Zaporzhizhia and Kherson as well as complete demilitarization, the end of Zelensky’s government and realignment into the Russian sphere of influence as well as potential Ukrainian reparations to Russia. Since Ukraine’s minimum demands and Russia’s minimum demands are so far apart the only thing left is to keep fighting and see who breaks first.

Tldr: negotiations are unlikely because there’s no trust and each side’s minimum demands are very far apart. The only thing that’s left is to keep fighting until one side or the other has to dramatically readjust their minimum demands.",2023-10-07T01:32:30+00:00

EU membership would also provide several security guarantees. 

IMF loan forgiveness and other aid to Ukraine would also be necessary, and perhaps a bending of the rules to give immediate entry to the EU. Anything less than wild generosity would make it impossible for Ukrainian leadership to sell a peace deal to their populace. 

As for how it would happen? Probably when both sides feel they can't get anything more from fighting. Ukrainians are suffering through a lot and their big offensive seems to have fallen far short of its goals while producing a lot of casualties.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Negotiations,k3zbw1t,DarrenX,,"A ""negotiated end"" to the war implies an agreement, where both sides agree to the terms.  I don't think any such agreement is possible.

There are only three possible outcomes (the third of which is unlikely in my lifetime):

1. Russia is defeated and driven from Ukrainian territory.  Ukraine joins NATO, or some other iron-clad security arrangement with the Western powers.  This is the only thing that will convince Russia (given the current moral, cultural, spiritual, and political conditions of that country) not to try again, (which would obviate the ""end"" part of the ""negotiated end"").  Yes, it's Cold War 2.0.  This won't be a ""negotiation"" involving Russia, because they will never agree to it.
2. Ukraine is entirely defeated and annihilated as an independent state, to be subsumed by Russia.  (99% of people who are currently calling for ""peace negotiations"" either explicitly want this outcome, or are completely indifferent if it occurs, and are dishonestly unwilling to acknowledge it).  Again, this is not a ""negotiated end"", it will happen on the battlefield without Ukraine's consent.  End result: Cold War 2.0 anyway.
3. A currently unforeseeable cultural and political change occurs in Russia, where somehow they learn to be a country that can live in peace with its neighbors like other countries, instead of seething with resentment of the West, and longing to be the menacing imperialist power they imagine the United States to be.  I think, as a minimum, that everyone who was an adult when the Soviet Union fell needs to die of old age before this process can begin.  The Soviet adults are morally and intellectually corrupted by longing to be the mighty empire they imagine that they were, an empire that \*defined itself\* as being an enemy of the West.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Negotiations,k40mnal,-ayli-,,"Ukraine, Russia, and NATO are all going to have to give up something for a negotiated peace to be workable. Right now it seems that none of the parties are willing to compromise, but if they were, here's a bunch of unpopular concessions that might actually result in lasting stability.

International recognition of the Crimean annexation, possibly with an internationally supervised repeat referendum as a prerequisite. Limited overland transit rights for Russia for non-military goods. Ukraine and NATO are going to hate this, but Russia is going to need something big to be convinced to lay down their arms in Ukraine. As far as concessions go, this is a bigger win for Russia than a loss for Ukraine and removes a potential point of conflict in the future.

Russian withdrawal from other areas of eastern Ukraine, to internationally recognized borders.

Russian commitment to democratization, freedom of speech, and full respect for human rights. Any plan here needs to include concrete goals and timelines (such as genuinely free elections and free operation of foreign press within Russia). This is the main thing that NATO needs to get to ensure stability in eastern Europe. If Russia can be turned back to a more democratic path, relations have a chance to normalize with time. If Russia remains on the track to dictatorship, that will only continue to cause problems in the future.

NATO (and possibly EU) commitment to a long-term moratorium on further eastward expansion, conditioned on Russia fully complying with all the terms of the agreement. Realistically, the main strategic benefit of inducting Ukraine into NATO is to help fight a war with Russia. The goal of this agreement is to make that war less likely, so NATO membership for Ukraine loses a lot of strategic value. Additionally, by agreeing on ground rules on the security situation in eastern Europe, Russia and NATO will have a more predictable foundation from which to move forward. Introducing a durable buffer zone between Russia and NATO will also cool down tensions in the regions, making it easier to reach peaceful solutions to other problems.

Limitations on number of Russian and NATO forces in eastern Europe, especially along Russia-NATO and Russia-Ukraine borders. This should be primarily aimed at reducing tensions and making it more difficult for either side to engage in aggressive posturing.

> Pumped hydro can never scale

Pumping water may not work everywhere, but it will work in *some* places. And it is one of many examples of existing technology to store energy. Also, the larger the grid, the less necessary energy storage is.

> environmental objections

This will always be an issue (and rightly so). *Every* source of energy will have an environmental impact. We should evaluate the impact of a new technology against the impact of the existing technology and the alternatives, and *not* against a standard of perfection.

I'm an art college student. I do not work nor have an income, but when I do (soon I hope) I want to do anything I can to help.
I'm worried human zones keep expanding with no control. No politic has ever mentioned something related. More humans being born = more resources demand + more destroyed habitats (and less resources the rest of us). No politic has punished any soda or big company either (they're stealing our water and deforesting whole zones). The current president of my country is polluting one of our most important natural water supplies for a project that isn't going to work (and most likely will kill humans in accidents when it does) (authorities ignore and allow this). Ppl in general who do have money don't seem to care. I'm getting tired of climate constantly making us sick cuz it ain't normal. I'm worried about all the species that are going to extinction because of habitat loss, illegal hunting, and the very same climate change. Also a lot of persons reproduce without ever thinking of any of this, actually without even thinking. Ps: My community is highly influenced by Catholicism and do parties with fireworks really often that leave tons of trash behind.

Getting politicians to act is still probably the most powerful thing you can do. They have so much funding and power available. So being involved in writing letters or campaigning to them is important. 

We had one group of kids in australia who showed up every single day to their local politicians office with a coffee to talk to him about a new law that was being proposed that would threaten renewable funding. In the end the pressure was so much the politicians said in parliament that he could not vote for this law as his constituents were so against it. So a few kids saved tens of millions of funding.

I know in the long term, sea level rise will put a large fraction of Florida underwater, but I’m really concerned with what’s going to happen in the next 10-20 years.

The three big concerns I have are heat, sea level rise, and storms.

I plan to live about 3 miles in from the coast, on somewhat higher ground (for Florida). Is sea level rise really going to be an issue that far in by 2040?

Hurricanes are obviously an issue, but if you are inland and not in a low area, most homes don’t actually see any flooding, just wind and rain, at least so far. What’s the worst a hurricane could do if you’re not on the coast?

And finally, what’s the heat forecast looking like? I can tolerate mid to high 90s and humid for a few months (the current summer temps) but if we hit 100+ and humid regularly that’s a dealbreaker.

climatechange,comment,West Bank,k4iz0c3,Hair_Deodorant,,"Can't help with any predictions, I can only tell you what I've experienced and the news I've collected. 

**I apologize for the lengthy reply.**

The humidity is downright oppressive maybe 75% of the year. South of Orlando we count winter in days. It'll probably be 85F on Christmas. We sometimes get cool weather, but it's gone in 2-3 days.

It's also rained, at a minimum, 1-2 times a week since the start of the year where I am. We haven't had much severe flooding due to the limestone and canal systems, but certain areas weren't so lucky, like Fort Lauderdale this year. 

The airport looked like a lake. Major roads were cut off and this mattered because South Florida's gasoline is trucked in. For almost a week there was no gas, but it was nothing compared to Hurricane Ian from September last year. In all my decades I had never seen anything like the storm surge at Fort Myers. Forget the next 20 years; consider that insane flooding has already begun.

When it comes to hurricanes, I think the rest of the country has it worse. Hurricanes you can get at least a day's warning, thanks in part to excellent EU storm modeling. But the thought of a tornado or derecho hitting in the middle of the night while you're sleeping truly terrifies me. 

The main problem with hurricanes is widespread damage on old infrastructure. A week ago there was a regular storm here and a neighbor's overgrown tree contacted the power line. Mind you, I'm about 10 miles inland. This one tree cut off power to almost 1,100 houses. I know because I called FPL to report it. This was one tree in an everyday thunderstorm.

One thing you didn't ask about is the insurance here. My friend in Ohio can **insure his** **house** for less than what I pay for fucking **car** coverage here.

Expect Florida to be subdivided into regions. The lesser populated north can become a new state or absorbed into GA / AL. 

Many have already explained the property insurance crisis and saltwater intrusion due to sea level rise. 

Sea level rise is generally accelerating for the following reasons:

More rapid ice loss from Greenland / Antarctica. 

Thermal expansion due to warmer ocean. 

Loss of polar gravitational mass due to ice loss. (Sea level is going down at the Poles and rising faster far away)

AMOC slowing and pulling less water off the coast. 

18.6 year oscilliating lunar orbital cycle. Last peak 2016. Next peak 2034-2035. 

Financial markets will anticipate the physical collapse before it happens. 

The state will not be able to print money and pay for the losses. Mortgage availability will wither as lenderss will follow insurers out of the state. Property values will descend and municipalities will not be able to fund long term investments as bond ratings will plummet. Beaches will erode and sand will be too scarce and expensive to replace it. 

Big storms will do damage that can't be repaired. 

South Florida will be lost and is too important to the current state economy for it to remain intact as is. Florida will have to be partitioned and separated into regionally discrete entities.

3. Here in New Orleans, we were under the heat dome that cover most of the central and southern US this summer for about a month. Super fun to be in a drought and yet still have enough humidity to raise the heat index to above 110 every day. Also, the coastal waters around Miami got above 95. That's hot tub temperature. That's steroids for hurricanes. Although the high pressure associated with the heat storm kept storms well out in the Atlantic, higher and higher Gulf and Caribbean water temps are making storms worse and less predictable. 
4. Move where you want to, of course.

On the occasion of World Environment Day, the UN refugee agency emphasizes the connection between climate-related crises and displacement. Globally, climate change is exacerbating poverty and instability.
 
It fuels tensions and competition for dwindling resources. Outbreaks of violence and extreme weather are forcing people who have fled before to flee again.
But even when peace is restored, the displaced cannot return if drought, flooding or rising sea levels have made their homelands uninhabitable.
From the point of view of the UN Refugee Agency, national partner of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), in addition to short-term financial resources, what is needed above all is political will and innovation to improve the situation of millions of people worldwide.
""Climate change is an emergency for everyone, everywhere. However, refugees, internally displaced persons and stateless people are almost unprotected in the face of the climate crisis. They often live in regions that lack the means to cushion the consequences of climate change,"" comments Peter Ruhenstroth-Bauer, Managing Director of UN refugee aid.
 
effects of climate change
In Afghanistan, rising temperatures and droughts have exacerbated the effects of 40 years of conflict and worsened food shortages in a country with over 3.5 million internally displaced people.
In the Sahel, temperatures are rising 1.5 times faster than in the rest of the world.Climate-related impacts are also increasing competition for resources in areas where armed groups are already fueling conflict and violence.
Environmental degradation and climate change also pose a double threat to refugees.
According to the UNHCR, in the last decade an average of 23 million people have been forced to flee their homes every year due to constant rain, prolonged droughts and heat waves as well as cyclones.
The poorer countries, in which most refugees and displaced persons found shelter when they had to leave not only their homes but also their home countries, are also particularly affected by climate change",2022-06-05T15:47:29+00:00

climatechange,comment,Conflict,ec7tmpm,skeeezoid,,"There isn't really a distinction. It's a genuine scientific disagreement among active researchers in the field (albeit a very asymmetric disagreement in terms of  numbers on each side - pretty much all other published work finds net mass losses since 2000). There's a write-up about it [here](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2015/11/so-what-is-really-happening-in-antarctica/). Essentially Zwally's estimate uses satellite altimeters which measure ice sheet elevation and the difference in their result comes down to assumptions made about the density of accumulation zones on the ice sheets (places where elevation is increasing), which relates to how snowfall has changed (or not changed) over the past few decades. Zwally assumes a high density - more compacted ice - and therefore elevation increases suggest relatively large mass accumulation. Other studies have assumed low density and therefore relatively small mass accumulation. When summed with the losses at the edges of the ice sheet (shown by all papers) this difference in estimated mass accumulation in the interior affects the total net mass change.

Having said that it's a genuine disagreement, a number of published comments on the paper have suggested some methodological issues concerning treatment of the data and a [2017 paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017GL072937) trying to test the various snowfall and density assumptions against relevant observations in the East Antarctic attempted to replicate the Zwally method and found that they could not reproduce the magnitude of mass gain that Zwally reported. Even with the greater density assumed by Zwally they found figures consistent with net Antarctic mass loss (albeit smaller than from other studies).

There are also other methods, such as gravity measurements from GRACE to get a direct indication of mass change, which studies have found also return a net mass loss.

I think it would be fair to say that there is a consensus of field specialists that Antarctica has very likely lost mass overall since 1992. Should also say that Zwally's results agree with the findings of an acceleration of mass loss - they just suggest it hasn't quite accelerated past zero yet.",2018-12-21T00:11:04+00:00

climatechange,comment,Conflict,ec8ygzv,None,,">This is the most robust study of the ice mass balance of Antarctica to date,” said assessment team co-lead Erik Ivins at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). “**It covers a longer period than our 2012 IMBIE study,** has a larger pool of participants, and incorporates refinements in our observing capability and an improved ability to assess uncertainties.”

The newer study using the latest data.

>e’re essentially in agreement with other studies that show an increase in ice discharge in the Antarctic Peninsula and the Thwaites and Pine Island region of West Antarctica,” said Jay Zwally, a glaciologist with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the study, which was published on Oct. 30 in the *Journal of Glaciology*. “Our main disagreement is for East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica – there, we see an ice gain that exceeds the losses in the other areas.”  Zwally added that his team “measured small height changes over large areas, as well as the large changes observed over smaller areas.”

The slightly older study only covers up to 2008 and suggests (as has been predicted for a long time) increasing snow accumulation is countering the loss of sea ice in the pre 2008 era.

> You underestimate how many people can die from different scenarios. Heat waves in India have been killing people for a few years now and it's getting hotter each year. Over 2 thousand died in one year in India just in 2015. What happens to those 1.2+ billion people when the summer gets too hot, since we already have good reason to believe it will at current rates. 

> Co2 is beneficial for plants, sure. Funny thing about humans and plants is that we seen to hate them between deforestation and desertification; kill em and/or make sure they can't grow back. More co2 + less plants = more leftover co2 not converted by plants.

> Co2 also causes a nice thing called ocean acidification. Thats another issue which is probably even bigger. Most of the oxygen we breathe comes from where? Anywhere from 50-80% comes from phytoplankton. And many studies, like this one show that phytoplankton populations have been declining. Not only is that bad because of the oxygen they produce, but also because they're an integral part of the marine food chain. The collapse of that population could have catastrophic effects, dwarfing the Great Barrier Reef bleaching/possible die off.

> This isn't taking into consideration the rise of sea level that will displace tens or hundreds of millions, many dying from flood events becoming more common. This isn't taking into consideration the lack of freshwater in areas of drought like the middle east and Africa, or even in the US in many states. This isn't taking into consideration the conflicts over land and resources that will spread further, especially with refugees in the hundreds of millions to billions spreading across the globe.

When Earth's zone for biodiversity shifts, it's going to shift **away** from where it's best in. We choose to live where it's best so when it shifts, it can only shift for the worse, not for better. This location bias gives us the false idea that Global Warming is making the planet more extreme, when it's only making our current locations more extreme.

In many of the places where humans didn't build cities, those places will become more habitable and more suited for biodiversity. The Saharan Desert is expected to become cooler, wetter, and greener.

For example, if the averaged global surface temperature were to reach 1.5ºC or higher over the 20-year period 2024-2043, or the 30-year period 2024-53, with respect to the averaged global surface temperature in the pre-industrial reference period 1850-1900, the world would reach 1.5ºC global warming or higher in 2043 or 2053.

We already breached 1.5C for 12 month. We are still emitting .. in fact, record breaking emissions. So the temperature is just going to go up.

 Insect and animal life as well as plant life will falter and collapse in the death belt, leading to a destruction of the food chain.

 The jet stream will wobble like a wet noodle before it collapses as the pressure and temps on the arctic side equalize with the ones on the temperate side and huge blocks set up. The wet bulb temps in the humid areas will sicken and kill many with kidney failure heat stroke and brain death as their bodies slow cook inside to a balmy 110 to 120. And death occurs in 6 hours or less depending on the temps, humidity etc.

For about the past 50 years, satellites owned by multiple countries have been observing and collecting climate, weather, and other data across the globe. Since the 1700s, temperatures have been recorded at stations around the world. In later years, global surface temperatures have been recorded by stations, ships, ARGO floats, buoys, and satellites. Climate model simulations are able to reconstruct climate temperature data for locations with sparse observations in the past.

Your link is from a climate denier blog so pretty biased. And where does it come from and what is this 1891-1920 year mean. Did the number stay the same all those years? Google couldn't find anything in that number on the picture.

[Here](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Evolution-of-the-number-of-measurement-stations-in-1900-1920-and-1940-in-the_fig3_331291041) is a picture showing the evolution in Africa of the number of stations with the references provided. And there are certainly more than 1 station in Africa.

>If the count is eave just reasonably true - is the almost total absence of stations in the southern hemisphere robust enough to form a reliable baseline that we should spend $trillions on ?

Well the absence of stations in the Southern hemisphere is a lie. And those stations don't include the number of readings from ships that record SST in the Southern Hemisphere.  More importantly most of the change in temperature has been since the 1970s when we had very reliable records.

>If the count is eave just reasonably true - is the almost total absence of stations in the southern hemisphere robust enough to form a reliable baseline that we should spend $trillions on ?

It's not true. And as I've stated, why does it matter where we start counting in order to determine the change.

What trillions are you talking about? The fact is we are going to spend trillions in increased insurance rates, damage to infrastructure, trying to control sea level rise, and border security for migration. That's not even counting the danger to civilization.

not much time so just to focus on one thing - your side is demanding we stop emitting co2 - ie to achieve this thing called 'net zero' in order to reduce the atmospheric co2 count, because you believe a hypothesis that states increased co2 causes increased surface temp. You believe this regardless of peer reviewed papers stating that in fact it's the opposite :  increased surface temps that cause an increase in co2 emissions. but anyway :

climatechange,post,Two-state solution,uyx9ir,iboughtarock,"Climate change facts, solutions, and additional resources.","# Facts:

* Daily we emit 117 million tons of CO2. Global CO2 emissions are 43 billion tons each year. [\[S\]](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
* As CO2 concentrations build in the atmosphere, infrared light radiated from earth's surface is absorbed by the CO2. Thus trapping heat in earth's atmosphere. This is known as the greenhouse effect. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect)
* 38% of global CO2 emissions have dissolved in the oceans. When CO2 dissolves in water it forms carbonic acid. This is known as ocean acidification. [\[S\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub) [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_storage_of_carbon_dioxide) [\[S\]](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/outstand/feel2633/feel2633.shtml)
* The ocean has 50 times more CO2 than the atmosphere. The ocean has 39,000 billion tons of CO2. The atmosphere has 750 billion tons of CO2. [\[S\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub)
* As the ocean becomes more acidic, less CO2 is able to be stored in the water. This leads to CO2 being released from the ocean and sent to the atmosphere. The same goes for ocean temperature. As water temperature rises, less CO2 is able to stay dissolved (e.g. leave a carbonated drink out on a warm day). [\[S\]](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016RG000533)
* As temperatures rise, soil begins to increase the release of carbon in a process known as soil respiration. Researchers estimate soil carbon loss over the 21st century will be equivalent to two decades of carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. [\[S\]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan2874)

# Solutions:

* **Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE):** Use mafic and ultramafic rocks (olivine, peridotite, etc.) to bind to CO2 and form carbonates. Thus converting CO2 into an alkaline carbonate mineral. These carbonates could then be placed in the ocean to raise the pH and bring it back to normal levels, and increase CO2 storage capacity in the ocean. [\[S\]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c08561) [\[S\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2019.00007/full)
* **Direct air capture (DAC):** Use large fans to concentrate CO2 into a chamber and then absorb the CO2 by various means. The CO2 can be converted into a long term storage medium such as a carbonate or left as vapor CO2. In the case of vapor CO2 there is some commercial value or it can be pumped into geological wells for storage. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_air_capture)
* **Renewable energy:** Wind, solar, geothermal, wave/tidal/marine power, etc. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy)
* **Cultured meats:** Growing meat from cell cultures instead of factory farming. This would free up billions of acres globally, democratize access to protein sources, and eliminate CO2 and CH4 emissions associated with factory farming. In the United States 41% of land use goes towards grazing and animal feed crops. These areas of land are usually high in sunlight and could be used for solar, wind, afforestation, or DAC. [\[S\]](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/land-use-land-value-tenure/major-land-uses/) [\[S\]](https://cellbasedtech.com/lab-grown-meat-companies) [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_agriculture)
* **Reducing fossil fuel emissions:** This can be done by scrubbing some of the CO2 from the source before emitting it to the atmosphere. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber)
* **Afforestation:** Afforestation is the establishment of a forest in an area where there was no previous tree cover. Tree-planting campaigns are sometimes criticized for targeting areas where forests would not naturally occur, such as grassland and savanna biomes. Afforestation can negatively affect ecosystems through increasing fragmentation, edge effects, and making the surface albedo darker (especially in northern regions).

Here's the podcast transcript:

Welcome to Beyond Money, the podcast where we discuss the technologies and businesses changing the world.  Today, we’re going to talk about Climate Change, the greatest problem humanity has ever faced.  A problem of our own creation, climate change will impact every single person’s life on this planet.  From the food that we eat, to the water that we drink, these basic necessities as well as our surrounding environments will be dramatically impacted in the future as climate change progressively continues to worsen over the coming decades.  Despite this, there’s a saying I’ve heard numerous times regarding capitalism and business.  “The greater the challenge, the greater the opportunity.”  Despite the enormous challenge and danger Climate Change presents us with, I believe it will be our greatest opportunity to create a beautiful, sustainable, and prosperous future, for all. 

Climate change isn’t a problem in the distant future, it’s a problem that our planet is dealing with right now. I’ve personally witnessed my home town experience the greatest flood it’s seen in over 100 years.  My college of Indiana University just faced one of the worst flash floods in over a century, and we all witnessed the devastating wildfires in Australia in 2020.  Climate change isn’t just wildfires in California or rising sea levels, it’s more extreme and unpredictable weather all over the globe.  It’s no surprise we’re seeing the worst wildfires globally ever, at the same time as the worst flooding ever.  In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, my hometown, I’ve witnessed in the middle of December temperatures rapidly fluctuate from 75 degrees and sunny one day to 20 degrees and snowing the next day.  75 degrees in Pittsburgh during the middle of December may sound great, but these extremely volatile weather patterns disrupt natural migration and growth cycles for both plants and animals. These extreme, unpredictable weather patterns will only continue to get worse as the amount of carbon in the atmosphere increases.  The global climate is a delicate balance, and as we continue to emit carbon into the atmosphere, we will slowly destabilize this balance.   We must all, working together, take drastic and rapid action in order to combat climate change.  We cannot be the first generation of people to provide our children with a worse future than ourselves.  I believe that all of us on Earth, working as one united people, can conquer climate change.  Climate change is too grand of a problem for any one nation to solve.  We must all be in this together, because if we aren’t, then the paradise we call Earth will quickly destabilize into a wasteland.

Fixing climate change will require dramatic, radical changes to the way we live on this planet, and it all starts with the very fuel that powers our world, oil. Oil and fossil fuels are destroying our planet, and it’s all because of the way we power our homes, cities, ships, cars, and planes.  While fossil fuels are incredibly energy dense, the way we power our planet must change.  Oil and natural gas still make up over 80% of the US’s energy consumption, and globally, fossil fuels make up 79% of total energy production. However, despite much of the energy production currently being fossil fuels, this is rapidly changing.  In 2019, wind and solar energy represented 72% of all energy capacity installed, meaning the vast majority of companies expanding electricity generation are choosing renewables over fossil fuel alternatives.  This can all be explained by one thing: cost. The cost to produce energy from solar, wind, and other renewables has greatly reduced over the past decade.  For example, the cost to generate electricity from solar energy has dropped from $359/Mwh in 2009 to just $40/Mwh in 2019, an 80% decrease in just 10 years.  Solar went from being the most expensive option to the least expensive option, all within a decade.  Electricity from wind has dramatically lowered in cost as well, with costs decreasing 70% over the same time period from $135/Mwh to $41/MwH. Now, it is cheaper on average to build solar and wind energy, versus ANY other type of energy.  

Now why did this happen?  Max Roser, from Our World in Data, explains: 

“The costs of fossil fuels and nuclear power depend largely on two factors, the price of the fuel that they burn and the power plant’s operating costs.  Renewable energy plants are different: their operating costs are comparatively low and they don’t have to pay for any fuel; their fuel doesn’t have to be dug out of the ground, their fuel – the wind and sunlight – comes to them. What is determining the cost of renewable power is the cost of the power plant, the cost of *the technology itself*.” 

As we can now see, it’s all about economies of scale. As we’ve scaled solar and wind energy production, it’s driven down the cost of those technologies, driving further economies of scale and therefore further demand.  More solar or wind deployment leads to prices falling, which in turn leads to more applications for solar or wind energy, which then leads to further demand and deployment of these technologies.  This positive feedback loop continues indefinitely.  To see this positive feedback loop and it’s dramatic impact, we can simply zoom out and look at the cost of renewable technologies over the long term.  For example, the price of solar modules has decreased 99.6% since 1976.  How dramatic is that! 99.6%!  This is the magic of technology and economies of scale, more growth leads to lower costs, which leads to even more growth.

Now while solar and wind technology are rapidly decreasing in cost, they still have one fundamental flaw.  The sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow.  How do we solve this problem, as electricity demand globally is constant, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Fortunately, we have some of the smartest minds working to solve this problem.  Tesla has developed cutting edge battery storage products which will store solar or wind energy in lithium-ion batteries, completely changing everything.  Now, solar energy generated during the day can be stored in these batteries, and distributed for use during night, even when the sun isn’t shining.  A combined solution of solar and wind energy generation with battery storage, now makes this energy available for use, 24/7.  And as battery costs continue to decline, the prospect of such a system only grows more appealing.  This is what gives me hope for the future.  These incredible technologies are becoming more accessible to more regions of the world due to these steep cost declines and fundamental improvements. With the fundamental problem of solar and wind energy now solved with a battery-based energy storage solution, there’s no reason why the entire world can’t be powered by sustainable energy. I’m not saying shut down all fossil fuel plants tomorrow, however, as this would cause a societal collapse.  We still rely on fossil fuels for critical infrastructure in the United States and around the globe.  What I’m truly advocating for is an accelerated push towards sustainable technology, as fast as possible, from everyone.  The technology is ready and here today, it’s all a matter of scaling production and distributing it to the world.

Now obviously scaling such a solution will require an immense amount of resources, talent and capital, yet I believe it will get done since this will be the world’s greatest economic opportunity. There is simply too much money to be made by building and deploying sustainable energy technology, as everyone on the planet will need it. The amount of jobs required to scale production, distribute, and deploy sustainable energy technology will be immense.  I believe scaling sustainable energy technology will generate tens of millions of jobs globally, with many of those jobs being in developing countries.  As these countries modernize and industrialize, they will demand sustainable energy solutions since they will all have rapidly increasing demand for electricity as their populations grow and standards of living rise. Solar and wind plants combined with batteries will be cheaper than any fossil fuel solution, so it’ll be a no-brainer to use sustainable technology solutions in these countries.  All of these regions will need an immense amount of people to distribute and maintain these technologies, which will help the economies of these regions. When fully distributed, sustainable energy technology will bring a rapid expansion of cheap electricity to regions that have never had power.  People in these regions will be able to have access to the internet, clean drinking water, and sanitary food for the first time.  Think of the innovation that will result globally, with these tools now at everyone’s disposal.  It makes it a lot easier to innovate and solve problems when you don’t have to find clean drinking water and food every day.

Now climate change isn’t all about the carbon emissions, although it plays the greatest role.  Our impact can be felt in other ways, such as the fertilizers we use in our agricultural fields and the deforestation activity we engage in to support growing crops, livestock, and other activities. Runoff from our agricultural fields into our rivers and oceans is killing huge amounts of marine life, and all ecosystems are delicate and connected.  Having a diverse ecosystem of life on the planet is crucial to our long-term survival, as diversity of life creates a robust global ecosystem that provides us with a variety of nutrients from various plants and animals.  When we destabilize this delicate global ecosystem, things quickly get out of hand.  Humanity’s overfishing has caused many marine ecosystems to collapse, dramatically reducing the amount of fish in the ocean, as many fish rely on other fish or marine plants to survive.  Fertilizers and other chemicals from human activities are also causing many coastal reef ecosystems to collapse, dramatically reducing the amount of food available for other marine life as well as ourselves.  We must figure out a way to sustainably manage our marine ecosystems, or else this trend will continue to worsen.  As the global population continues to rise, the importance of this will only increase, as we will have to balance an ever-increasing demand for food with a smaller and smaller pool of marine life.  If we eat all of the food in the ocean, we will starve.   We must find a balance.  Every ecosystem on the planet relies on another ecosystem, whether its bears relying on fish from the ocean or plants relying on bees to pollinate them.  As we disrupt this balance by destroying ecosystems, our problems will only continue to worsen.  Luckily for us, innovative companies are coming up with creative solutions to help us with our ever-growing food and protein demands.  We’ll dive deeper into this in the next podcast.

In conclusion, despite the immense problem climate change poses and the deteriorating situation currently, I believe humanity will perservere.  With the world’s greatest talent flocking to companies that solve this problem, I believe in human ingenuity and the belief that anything is possible.  I personally will be taking my talents to a company that fights climate change, as I see no greater cause to fight for.  A future where the Earth is a lush, green paradise, where we breathe clean air and live sustainably is a future I desire, and I strive to help create it. We must attack the problem of climate change from all fronts, not just one vector.  We must eat sustainably, power our homes sustainably, travel sustainably, and manage our surrounding ecosystems sustainably.  Sustainable technologies are rapidly declining in cost and improving, and I believe we will do all of these things. Despite the tough road ahead, I believe that we will prevail, and create a beautiful future as a result.  Don’t lose faith, don’t give up.  Help is on the way, and we will conquer climate change.

I hope you enjoyed the show, and found today’s podcast entertaining and informative.  If you enjoyed the topic of climate change, you’re in for a treat, as the next podcast will dive deep into a company that’s revolutionizing how humanity consumes protein, and saving the planet as a result.  Stay tuned.  We also discussed mostly solar and wind technology solutions, but nuclear is equally if not more promising long-term.  A future podcast will cover innovations in this space and what the future of nuclear power looks like.  Trust me, it’s beyond exciting.

\- There has been a dramatic increase in wells running dry in the South East & North West sections of the Central Valley. The ground in certain areas has sunken 10-28 feet due to aquifer depletion. Once this happens the water does not come back underground to that location. Areas in the North West Central Valley that typically get 12.5 inches of rain have only gotten 1.5 inches. The grass in that region did not have enough water to complete their life cycle and dried two months earlier than what typically is expected. The worst areas were in West Shasta County and West Tehama County, but water depletion was observed throughout California interior landscapes.

\- There are emerging implications of the drought as Central Valley farmers leave more than 400k acres empty. Normally vast landscapes of watered crops have a cooling effect on the local climate through evaporation, but this year dry empty fields will likely cause drier air this summer and allow temperatures to get much hotter in the Central Valley, a region which already gets triple digit heat.

\- Due to the water shortages many hydroelectric dams will be unable to operate, which utility companies are warning in advance will cause outages during peak demand in summer. This could be a cascading effect causing a dramatic spike in heatstroke among local residents. Unfortunately we are also predicting a very severe fire season this year, which will also impact both on-grid and off-grid solar for extended periods of time, possibly even months. This combined effect could leave many people running on generators while gas prices are already extremely high.

\- Zone Blue #1 Northern Coastal areas are still predicted to remain most habitable (from Marin County to Del Norte), Coastal Humboldt County and Coastal Del Norte County seem to have the healthiest ecosystems currently out of all samples we have taken. Plant and soil moisture levels are optimal in these locations at the present time even though elsewhere there has been drought degradation in nearly every other region in California. We believe this is likely due to the region's ability to generate it's own precipitation from Coastal fog. The mountains seem to do a better job at trapping the coastal air in this region, which allows the clouds to reach dew point after they enter at night and form nighttime drizzle occasionally. This area also benefits from cool ocean air during summer causing evaporation to be slow. The ecological health of this region is the only positive news we have to report during this term.

\- Unfortunately in the Sierra mountain range & the Eastern Mendocino mountain range there has been unprecedented tree die off both from drought and from a snowstorm during winter that caused a build up of heavy snow on branches. This caused drought affected trees to buckle and break during winter. But as the branches and trees dry out during summer it will add to the fuel load during fire season. This alone will increase fire risk. But worse even is that the surviving trees that were damaged heal themselves by increasing resin output. We have measured it this year, and there is significantly increased resin that could cause the trees to become extremely dangerous if they catch on fire, possibly to the point of explosive combustibility. If there are fires on either of these mountain ranges it often causes extended smoke accumulation in the Northern Central Valley which could lead to unsafe air quality for cities such as Redding, Red Bluff, and Chico.

\-The last three years have been La Nina years. Which causes cool surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. This usually creates a cooling effect over the West coast of the US, but unfortunately it has had very little impact at stopping the extreme summer heatwaves which inland California has been experiencing annually. We do worry about how high the temperature could climb once La Nina has finished it's cycle, because this year Earth has reached it's highest CO2 content to date. Additionally La Nina should cause increased precipitation for Northern California, but instead there has been far less.

\-Comments: We are witnessing a rapidly changing climate, and we've been working hard to document as much as possible. We believe that just as inland Southern CA is a desert, inland Northern CA will also soon become a desert. Desertification is happening all around the world right now, and this is where we are observing it happen here. 

\[\[ Original Post below \]\]

For a college project my group spent half the year studying regions in California for their future habitability as climate change progresses.

We researched both on the ground and using public climate and event records.

The regions listed above are 2 high risk land areas and 2 climate refuge land areas.

As simplistic as our presentation is our findings are based on lengthy and rigorous studying. Please be respectful in the comments because I am not going to argue with anyone on here. Often people that dispute the facts are either personally invested in high risk areas or they are climate change deniers. I don't have the patience for either. The reason I'm posting this on reddit is to gather public responses before our presentation.

The purpose of the presentation is to reach out to developers so they can start preparing housing and business in safer locations as the climate crisis continues.

* (High Risk Zone: Red #1) The Central Valley is a low lying flat region. Most of the central valley is going to be high risk, but the highlighted area is of particular concern. In this area high population cities such as Sacramento are located. The elevation in Sacramento is 26ft. When people think of areas impacted by sea level rise, most people think of coastal areas. But the reality is for California most of the land impacted by sea level rise will be the Central Valley region. Most coastal locations in California are situated far enough above sea level to be safe. Los Angeles for example has a elevation of 305ft and will continue to be well above water inundation. Unfortunately for low lying inland cities such as Sacramento, the rise will overwhelm infrastructure. Ground water will likely get pushed up from underground before ocean flooding even arrives. This region is also heavily impacted by wildfire smoke because the central valley acts like a bowl trapping the smoky air in. The region is already known to have some of the worst air quality in the nation, but the increase in wildfires is adding an extra air quality hazard on a regular basis.
* (High Risk Zone: Red #2) The Western facing Sierra foothills is the highest risk wildfire zone in California, and likely the highest risk zone in the United States. The elevation of the sierra foothills is 500 ft - 4000 ft. You may think at those elevations that the climate would feel cooler, but as someone who has a lot of personal experience in this area that is not the case. Unlike the Central Valley, the Sierra Foothills does not have access to the delta breeze, which is a cool coastal wind that provides relief on hot summer days to the Central Valley. Additionally those elevations are not high enough to create a cool summer climate and the added UV impact in this hot climate just makes it sting to be in the sun and heats up houses faster. The air heats quicker at this elevation which causes a larger portion of the day to be hot. 90F in the sun at this elevation often feels worse than 100F in the Central Valley. Las Vegas for example is 2000ft elevation and is the second hottest City in the United States. The summer heat in this region is often underestimated. Recently a young family in Mariposa county died because of heat stroke while on a morning hike. Wildfire risks here are high. 60 percent of rain in California falls in the Sierras. But it all dumps down within a few winter months and then it quickly gets hot and dry for more than half the year. The high winter precipitation creates a lot of brush that burns. High winter Rainfall and the hot dry summer which has only been getting hotter and drier is why this area is such a fire risk. Additionally the types of vegetation that grows in this region burns hotter than most woods. Not all forests are equal when it comes to fire risk. Unlike coastal California, the humidity inland is vastly reduced and fires thrive in the dry air. Humidity levels in the foothills are often as low as 5% because extra moisture doesn't arrive from the delta breeze. Even after severe wildfires a new wildfire can happen every year due to the dry grasses and the fact that organic matter on the ground takes years to decompose during the extended dry times. This means that even the top soil can burn. Paradise CA and Greenville CA which both completely burned down within the last few years are located in zone Red#2. The cost alone for fire insurance in high wildfire risk zones is around 5-10× more to insure. Which will suppress development for businesses and farms in these areas. All this combined makes the Sierra Foothills area one of the least habitable regions based on our data.
* (Refuge Zone: Blue #1) The Northern California coast has elevated topography that will not be impacted much by sea level rise. Additionally the cool ocean air gets trapped into the coastal region making the air cool and moist. The trees in the coastal belt of far northern California are more likely to moss over than burn. Additionally the coastal winds that move West to East and mountain range shelters the area in from most wildfire smoke even when there are fires blazing inland. This area particularly stands out as a refuge away from extreme heatwaves. For example during the Pacific Heatwave of 2021 Redding CA was nearly 120F while Eureka CA was 65F-70F at the same time. Summers and winters in the area are mild, and as climate change continues this region will likely be one of the most comfortable climates in the United State. We predict this area will soon be a extremely desirable location to live due to the weather. Similar to how Santa Barbara is in present day.
* (Refuge Zone: Blue #2) The high desert region in southern California will be considered a climate change refuge because of the lack of flammable vegetation. Although it does get hot here, as wildfires continue to get worse a new appreciation for desert life will likely arise. Additionally because there is very little forest upwind of this area, wildfire smoke will be less of an issue compared to most other interior regions.

Closing thoughts:

We would like to be a voice of encouragement for developers and investors to utilize these less populated refuge regions in order to prepare the near future population for displacement and climate change related disasters. The only long term cost effective solution is a slow preplanned migration.

There are other risk and refuge locations that we identified in our research, but these are the areas we found to be most significant. We wanted our presentation to be easy to understand as a guide for development.

I have been a resident of California for 50 years and have sadly seen the decline of the ecosystems and changing climate. As well intentioned as your proposed refuge regions may be, I think it is just kind of postponing the inevitable and not facing or addressing the reality. Do I really want to abandon 90% of California just to escape the decline. This is a short term bandaid that allows one to ignore the problem head on. Either we save the whole of California or just face and accept a bleak and dire future. I for one am not fine with watching the forests of the Sierra go up in flames or die from massive bark beetle infestations.

I will say that I find the idea that the high desert in Southern California would potential refuge area somewhat puzzling. The NYTimes, I think, did some analysis about expected days of extreme heat (I wish I could remember the source, as it's come up in conversation a couple of times with my friends since then) and my takeaway from that was that inland areas of Southern California would likely be uninhabitable because of the frequency of extremely hot days and the infrastructure and safety challenges they create. 

(My takeaway from that analysis that I can't remember was very much do not buy an investment property in Joshua Tree, which several people I know are doing).

climatechange,comment,Two-state solution,ih08f6g,SlowBear5,,Interesting read and analysis. I second the comment about the high desert. I don’t think water issues were addressed but I’m not sure if you weren’t looking at that. The dust and air pollution problems from dry lake beds from reduced water (Owen’s Lake and not exactly in the area but similar issues with Mono and Salton Sea) could be an issue for air quality in the future. The heat in those regions could definitely be extreme and with reduced snow pack in the Sierra there is little chance for water resources beyond import from the Colorado (doubt LA will give the Owen’s valley water back anytime soon/ever). I would expect that there will continue to be growth along the interstate corridors but don’t see it being a “refuge”. Finally regarding fire risk the area can get natural lightning and have very high winds and can sustain large fires in some cases (mojave preserve Dome fire).

climatechange,post,Two-state solution,1thbbz,MyronJPoltroonian,GANZ FALSCH,"The scientist Wolfgang Pauli was known for his often less than polite criticism of the work of some of his colleagues. He would sometimes exclaim ""wrong"" or ""completely wrong"" when he disagreed with someone. He even sadly said, ""It is not even wrong"". The phrase ""not even wrong"" carries two different connotations. A theory can be ""not even wrong"" because it is so incomplete and ill-defined that it can't be used to make firm predictions whose failure would show it to be wrong. This has been the situation of man made global warming/climate change theory from its beginnings to the present day. Most new theoretical ideas begin in this state; it can take quite a bit of work before their implications are understood as to whether the idea is right or wrong. There is, however, something worse than a wrong idea. In the case of the man made global warming/climate change theory, some researchers are abandoning fundamental scientific principals rather that admit a theory is wrong. Worse than being wrong is to refuse to admit it when one is wrong, or, as he phrased it: ""Ganz Falsch”, i.e.: it is not even wrong, it is “completely false"". Not one of the computer models being used to predict the future of earth's climate changes have ever been able to predict the climate changes from the past to the present, even though they were fed every last bit of scientific fact as based on the hard evidence of what has actually happened to our climate to date. That Al Gore (and his sycophants) intentionally use the term ""denier"" to imply that anyone who dares to disagree with them and their colleagues in the political sphere, or their coconspirators in the United Nations, is akin to the anti holocaust ranting's of those who hate Jews. He and they also cleverly use the term ""outlier"", which in the scientific community defines something in their findings that is at odds with the theory being tested, but is considered to be inconsequential to the final outcome (or ""Solution""), to imply that the scientist's, and any one else who disagrees with them, are not to be believed or listened to. ""Scientific Method""? What Scientific Method does not allow for questioning and rigorous rebuttal of any and every theory - however ""Established"" and ""Settled"" it may appear to be? (I remind you of Einsteins Theory of Relativity having just been disproved/reproved. I.e.: ""Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light"" - However, ""Something"" just did/did not.) Why does the phrase ""Socialism"" come to mind? It's because in order to "" ... act before all the evidence is in, just in case it's correct"" requires an ungodly blend of Fascistic Socialism and Religious Fervor (a.k.a., ""Environmentalism"") to be imposed on everyone. Carbon Credits; Cap and Trade; Mercury filled light bulbs; Toilet Capacity; Bovine Flatulence (a fitting term for the methods the ""bull in the china shop"" green regulators in charge envision implementing), and there are so many more to mention it would take a infinite compendium to index the injustices to be done in the name of ""Saving the Planet"", ""Before it's too late!"" (or we really know what we're doing). Study the evidence with an open mind, not one filled with the preconceived notion that the only ""pure"" scientists are the ones who do research on the governments dole. (Where do you think most university research grants come from? How about evaluating possible peer pressure and “greener goals”, coupled with the drying up of funds for unpopular or unprofitable research? Don’t forget, tenure is, after all, basically a popularity contest.) If you believe that we can learn from the past, remember the recanting of his heliocentric theory, on the pain of death to be enforced by the powers that be, by Galileo.",2013-12-22T20:51:36+00:00

But honestly, I think you're wasting your time, at least in this case.  There is nothing you can say that will change his mind.  Nothing.  The biggest reason that even sensible gun control has trouble becoming law is because of the lopsided nature of people's feelings about guns.  The pro-gun crowd goes absolutely bonkers if there is even a hint of some sort of gun control while the other side just doesn't get too excited about it.  The NRA and some Republican groups have leveraged this and they purposely get people riled up to make sure that they vote and that they ""hate"" anyone who wants some gun control.  Notice how he called you a libtard?  

Now, part of the problem is that I think that the gun control group has done a pretty terrible job of getting their point across.  Republicans and in particular the pro-gun crowd respond to emotions and the gun control crowd is trying to make a factual argument which is a complete waste.  To change the debate, while distasteful, pictures from these gun massacres need to be available on the internet so people can see what guns really do.  What you see in movies when someone gets shot is not realistic at all.  Imagine after the Newtown massacre if pictures of those children filled with bullet holes had been published.  Disgusting?  Yes.  But it would change the debate instantly.  The right avoids any discussion of guns after these massacres and waits for things to cool down.  Then they go back to inciting people regarding gun control.  Every time I bring this up I get a lot of negative comments but the fight is lopsided and thousands of people die every year because of gun violence.

guncontrol,comment,Conflict,fs295pt,kardoni781,,"What we do here in the US, is legally introduce 20+ million new professionally manufactured firearms into circulation every year. Once in circulation, these firearms can be transferred through undocumented transactions under Federal law. Additionally, there are no Federal secure storage or reporting laws. As a result, a hypothetical missing link is created in a firearm’s chain of custody. Ultimately this removes any accountability as hypothetically, a firearm could have been transferred to “some guy” or been stolen by “some guy” prior to ending up in a criminal investigation. This makes prosecuting unlawful firearm transfers borderline impossible without a flat out confession. If you can’t prove, you can’t prosecute. If you can’t prosecute, what’s there to deter an unlawful act?

So in short, 20+ million new firearms are introduced into US circulation every year. A percentage of those 20 million new firearms are diverted to illegal commerce with little to no accountability. What’s the percentage? Enough to supply the demand to the point where an “illegal” firearm can be purchased for less than 100 bucks",2020-05-28T06:10:24+00:00
guncontrol,comment,Conflict,ftq4ksd,TheWiseAutisticOne,,The big fear in American gun culture and mine as well is the monopoly on violence by the state that does not mean that I reject all forms of gun control I think certain firearms definitely need to be regulated (not banned) like some military firearms and I definitely feel we need to change the culture to one that is more responsible and trained. One idea I came up with is allowing towns/county’s to form there own militias and give them their own ranges and armories to store the towns weapons. The town can dictate what weapons are allowed in the home and what’s allowed in the range and all the guns and gun owners are part of a registry that is not allowed to be accessed by the federal (only local government) government unless a warrant is needed. The militia will be vetted the same way we vet people joining the military maybe to a lesser extent. The militia will be broken up into two categories active and reserve the reserve will be just people using the range and being taught standard firearms safety and such active duty will be conflict police called whenever there is say an active shooter situation or someone with a weapon and regular police will move to a more conflict resolution role and be trained in dealing with conflicts where there is no weapon.

The idea that if the policing authority has a weapon, and that therefore every citizen needs to have access to that same weapon, is completely defeating the purpose of a policing force. This is just blatantly not understanding how a society works. 

If you go down that road, it'd just become an arms race of the policing force trying to increase their ability to police, resulting in more and more aggressive behavior and increases in military style weaponry and gear, so like the US right now. 

If you put some common sense restrictions on weapons however, the policing force doesn't have to become geared up, paranoid, and/or trigger happy people, and you'd have a society more akin to that of other developed countries, where less people die a year from firearms than on a daily basis in the US. 

For example, the amount of times a cop has killed a suspect in the UK in its entire history can be found on a single wikipedia page. The US has a single wikipedia page, per year, per month.

As far as black market's go, there already is a huge black market for weapons, and it is driven by the proliferation of gun theft.

guncontrol,comment,War,k2g81iv,ICBanMI,,"Drugs are straight forward to make (can teach someone to do it), relatively cheap to manufacture and transport, always in demand, and have high profit margins.

Guns you need an entire factory with expensive metals to make, specialized tools and machines. Else you're doing one offs. The metals are way more expensive and difficult to source in large numbers. Just as expensive to transport while being less profitable and less margin. You also get what you pay for-bad manufacturing makes bad firearms. There is a reason ~200,000 firearms go into Mexico every year from the US, and Mexico has only one gun manufacturer.  

In the US state laws vary heavily. We would already be able to see this, IF TRUE, at a microscale in states like New York and California. Guns trafficked in can be more expensive, but a lot are not. Overall gun violence is a fraction what it is the states with lax gun laws. Gun suicides are 10x less in states with strong gun control laws. So the argument doesn't hold up in the United States... or else New York/California/Hawaii would be the most violent states.

Looking at countries like Australian, black market firearms are $10-30k by some reports while their deaths from firearms are almost non-existent.

guncontrol,post,Ceasefire,17rztc,SwiftyLeZar,"My ongoing series of myths about gun control. Today, myth #1: ""gun control doesn't work.""","Gun control has a proven record of effectiveness in helping reduce gun violence and gun crime. But the argument that it doesn't work is crucial to the anti-gun control agenda. The gun-rights extremist *must* cling to the idea that gun control is ineffective, no matter what the evidence against it, because otherwise his whole case is shot.

To begin with a broad view, [states with more gun control tend to have fewer gun deaths](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/01/the-geography-of-gun-deaths/69354/). There are confounding factors here; for example, the South is generally more impoverished, which contributes to its oft-higher crime rates. But the presence of gun control laws is also an important factor. The fact that it is one of many does not mean it is insignificant.

Why is there a correlation between gun control laws and fewer gun deaths? Because gun control often works. Witness these specific examples of successful gun control:

* In 1992, the Kansas City Police Department conducted a novel experiment: officers working a beat with an abnormally high number of homicides and firearm-related crimes agreed to work overtime to help clean the streets of illegal guns. And [it worked](http://www.ojjdp.gov/pubs/gun_violence/sect05-a.html). Gun crimes decreased in the area by 49%. (Some might respond that this isn't gun control, but it absolutely is. These officers were expanding enforcement of *gun control*.)

* The Massachusetts Bartley-Fox Amendment, passed in 1974, [produced a substantial reduction in firearms homicides, with no corresponding increase in the non-gun homicide rate.](http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10881&page=228)

* The “Boston miracle”: Operation Ceasefire, an organized effort to restrict youth access to guns undertaken by the city in the ‘90s, has been found to be [associated with reductions in youth gun homicide and gun assaults among all age groups.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CDIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncjrs.gov%2Fpdffiles1%2Fnij%2F188741.pdf&ei=FbvbUPyLEY_69gTT0oG4CA&usg=AFQjCNEPttipuIBmWOs2way3nXHWfoc2Qw) (These findings held even after adjusting for national and regional trends.)

* Several states have laws restricting access to firearms by individuals under restraining orders. A study found that these laws [reduced intimate partner homicide.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16679499)

One of the most disingenuous anti-gun control arguments is that gun control obviously hasn't worked because there is still gun violence, even in places with gun-control laws. This is an absurd piece of libertarian rhetoric that, taken to its logical extreme, would mean that *no law anywhere has ever been effective* and all laws should thus be thrown out. Apply this reasoning, for example, to murder laws: we have laws against murder, yet people still murder; murder laws must not work.

The purpose of any prohibitive law is to reduce occurrences of some undesired behavior, be it murder, arson, rape, etc. No one expects anti-murder laws to eliminate all murder. Why do we expect gun-control laws to eliminate all gun violence? I can only assume that gun-rights people hold gun control to an unrealistically high standard so they can dismiss it without the hassle of making an actual, thoughtful assessment of its effects.

Gun control is not and has never been about completely obliterating all gun violence from the earth. We can’t prevent every single criminal who wants a gun from getting one. But we can make getting a gun as difficult for criminals as possible, which we know from experience can be effective. That’s a meaningful accomplishment that could save lives.

If your standard for an “effective” gun-control law is one that eliminates all bad behavior and causes the world to join hands and sing a note-perfect rendition of “Get Together” by The Youngbloods, then I suppose you'll dismiss gun control as ineffective. However, any intellectually honest person who examines the evidence will be convinced that there is a place for gun control.

That said, *not every gun-control law that has ever been tried works.* Years of experience with various measures has given us a better understanding of what is effective and what isn't. The 1968 Federal Gun Control Act, for example, didn't work as well as hoped, because of lax enforcement and gaping loopholes. That one or another gun-control law wasn't effective, however, doesn't discredit the whole idea of gun control. Well-enforced gun control laws can work.",2013-02-02T23:15:24+00:00

guncontrol,comment,Ceasefire,c88ibvz,The_Hoopla,,"I will admit, as a gun rights advocate, this is the best argument I've read for the other side (most arguments I'd say amount merely to ""why do people need guns"", which, admittedly, is a fairly shitty argument. Considering we don't ban things because we need them or not). Anyway. It's refreshing to see someone with some actual goddamn points.

Now, let me address somethings that I found. I would first like to state that this:
 >The gun-rights extremist must cling to the idea that gun control is ineffective, no matter what the evidence against it, because otherwise his whole case is shot.
The evidence for gun control is, well, rather minimal in comparison. I'm not stating that there is no evidence to support it, because quite frankly there is, I'm merely stating that the evidence to the contrary is far greater, both in quantity and in scale. I would post the hundreds of examples, but it seems you already realize that they exist...so I won't to save us both some time.

After reading through this, it seems as though you have forgotten the fact that guns protect people as well. To this you might say, ""oh but that's just a self perpetuating problem"", and you wouldn't be entirely incorrect. To an extent it is, that being said, guns also defend those against people without guns (ie home invasions, knife muggings, assault, etc etc.) On average actually, guns protect far more people than they actually hurt. And, with that probably unbelievable statement, comes a wonderful source.

SOURCE GENIE!---->http://www.saf.org/lawreviews/kleckandgertz1.htm 

(from a liberal University no less)

I'll save you some reading. I bet you've heard the absurd claim from the NRA that ""Law Abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals 2.5 million times every year, or about 6,850 times per day. This means that each year firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens, rather than take innocent lives. Concealed carry laws have reduced the murder rates by an average of 8.5% in states that have enacted them."" 

Now, even as a gun friendly person, I didn't really believe those inflated, outrageous numbers. So I looked into it. 

Apparently, while this is true according to the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, the ""2.5 million"" is also a claimed number, meaning this is simply off accounts of people stating that a gun saved their life. I'll let you read the article yourself if you'd like, but the chill guys at Northwestern said ""400,000"" is basically the lowest logical estimate anyone should be willing to make. That's still around 13 people saved for every one killed by a firearm. 

Now, you can discount or toss out that number, but the point remains. When you post outrageous gun control laws (and at the end, I'll post some not-so-outrageous gun control laws that many pro-gunners are actually very much for so we can all stop being labeled as redneck psychopaths), you actually end up hurting those who wish to defend themselves UNLESS you can eliminate all guns everywhere (even those who have the illegally) which, as you said it yourself, won't happen. The current bill trying to be passed is purely aesthetic, with the exception of the high capacity magazine laws...which...we can discuss on a different day.

IN CONCLUSION: Gun Control that everyone's for

1. Background Checks
2. Far more difficult for ex-cons to obtain weapons
3. Firearm registration, so people can trace back straw purchases. 
4. More stringent punishment on those who break these laws.
5. Easy to file paperwork on private purchases for registration (otherwise people won't do it).
6. You're 4th point actually is something I would vote for (or perhaps jail time if caught close to that person WITH a gun).

I very much have nothing against bills ideas like this, although some extremists, which every group has, are. So. There you go. You seem like  cool guy, smart at the very least. Just want you to know we aren't all crazy ;).

To give you a general answer for the meantime, the DC handgun ban corresponded with a sustained, statistically significant decline in homicide rates, which was offset and then some by a crack epidemic and associated atrocities that emerged in the late '80s.

All of this is borne out in your graph. You see volatile murder rates in the pre-1976 period, followed by a sustained drop in murder rates that never rises to the peaks it reached in the years just before the law (1966-1974), until the late '80s.

Your statement is partially correct, an increase in gun laws will not effect somebody who has an illegal gun already, but it can go a long way in preventing somebody from getting an illegal gun in the future. Banning certain forms of guns would cause a drastic decrease in their production, and also a massive decrease in their presence. You said you weren't going to go into statistics so I won't either, but a large amount of guns are illegally obtained by robbing gun stores afterhours. If certain guns were banned, they wouldn't be in the store to be stolen in the first place. Also, the amount of crimes committed with illegally obtained guns is miniscule compared to the amount of crimes committed by people who own them legally.  I doubt anybody is trying to get rid of guns completely. The thing in question here is what guns are readily available to be placed into citizens hands.  In response to your last question, if somebody points a gun at you, you should hope you know how to defend yourself with a 9 millimeter instead of an M16.",2013-02-03T07:54:55+00:00

""National Research Council, 2004: The initial model specification, when extended to new data, does not show evidence that passage of right-to-carry laws reduces crime. The estimated effects are highly sensitive to seemingly minor changes in the model specification and control variables. No link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data, even in the initial sample; it is only once numerous covariates are included that the negative results in the early data emerge. While the trend models show a reduction in the crime growth rate following the adoption of right-to-carry laws, these trend reductions occur long after law adoption, casting serious doubt on the proposition that the trend models estimated in the literature reflect effects of the law change. Finally, some of the point estimates are imprecise. Thus, the committee concludes that with the current evidence it is not possible to determine that there is a causal link between the passage of right-to-carry laws and crime rates.""",2013-02-03T19:16:06+00:00

Still, you're stepping into extremely foggy statistical terrain if you're trying to count the number of lives saved by guns. As you correctly point out, Kleck's number is crap.

> ... ""400,000"" is basically the lowest logical estimate anyone should be willing to make. That's still around 13 people saved for every one killed by a firearm.

The problem is that most data we have suggest the exact opposite -- firearms are used far more often in suicides, homicides, and accidental shootings than they are in self-defense. You've already acknowledged that the 2.5 million number is worthless but I would point out that even the 400,000 number is speculative and at odds with the data. [Quoth TIME:](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,152446,00.html)

> [Kleck's] numbers are based on a 1981 poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates. It asked 1,228 U.S. voters whether in the previous five years any member of their household had 'used a handgun, even if it was not fired, for self-protection or for the protection of property.' Roughly 4% (about 50 people) said they had done so. Projecting that percentage onto the number of U.S. households in the five years covered by the poll (1976-81), Kleck came up with the estimate that handguns had been used protectively 3,224,880 times, or 645,000 a year. Comparing that with surveys that included rifles and shotguns, he estimated that all types of guns are used defensively about a million times a year.

>Is his analysis valid? 'I certainly don't feel very comfortable with the way he's used the data,' says Hart Research president Geoffrey Garin. While Kleck based his findings on the Hart survey, his analysis of the circumstances under which guns were used came from other studies. ... Says William Eastman, president of the California Chiefs of Police Association, about the Kleck conclusions: **'It annoys the hell out of me. There's no basis for that data.'**

Here's the point I want to emphasize:

> There is far more research on the question of who is most likely to get killed when someone keeps a gun at home. In a 1986 study called ""Protection or Peril?,"" Dr. Arthur Kellermann, a University of Tennessee professor of medicine, and Dr. Donald Reay, chief medical examiner of King County in Washington, concluded that for each defensive, justifiable homicide there were 43 murders, suicides or accidental deaths. Out of 398 gunshot fatalities in homes in King County between 1978 and 1983, **only nine were motivated by self-defense.**

> The one-week survey by TIME found a similar ratio on a national basis: **only 14 of the 464 gun deaths resulted from defensive firing.** An alarming 216 were suicides, 22 were accidental, and many of the rest involved homicides among people who knew each other well rather than citizens gunned down by strangers.

The Kellermann study is hotly disputed by the NRA and other anti-gun control types, though, as I'll discuss in later installments of this series, mostly not for valid reasons.


> ... but the point remains.

If guns kill more people than they save, the point must unfortunately be discarded.

guncontrol,post,Peace process,3p0cdm,parhammorgie,Reddit and Imgur need to Get Serious about Gun Control,"Here is my question why is “American” way supposed to be anti-gun control no if, ands, or buts? While exploring reddit, social media, and usually more conservative comments, I have seen gun control posts, images/comments usually shown in a jokingly manner, or in a complete opposition of any movement in gun laws. In my post I will break down the pros and cons of guns in America. I will show how Japan differs in it's gun laws, and why, and I will address the seriousness of gun control, and how easy it is to get a gun in America. I would like the comments about my post to be serious, and not disrespectful. I would like to discuss what other American citizens think about the second amendment, and what proactive solutions we can take as Americans to regulate and organize our firearm system in America. Also if you are a person commenting from another country, please offer some insight or suggestions for the United States for firearm safety. We really need to find common ground between all Americans when it comes to firearm safety and gun control. 

If I know anything about America, I know that we enjoy debate, and conflict. We all have very strong views with little room to budge. I support progressive issues such as prochoice, and environmental issues. Until recently I never even considered guns as a problem, until after Barack Obama was elected as President. As many Americans know our nation has dealt with horrific situations and tragedies due to gun violence whether in major cities (Baltimore, and Saint Louis) with gang violence, and police shootings, or in rural schools, churches, and even movie theatres. (Louisiana and Aurora Colorado). 

I will not be the strong gun-control advocate that threatens anti gun control Americans. As with the two-party system of Democratic and Republicans in America, we can see how butting heads and having loud arguments over issues gets little to nothing done. 

The pros of guns include a sense of security, and to deter criminals. According to safewise.com article “Pros and Cons of Gun Ownership for Home Security”. In the case of guns living Americans a sense of security, “ For many gun owners, it’s a simple calculus: having a gun gives them at least a fighting chance in the event that a burglar or home invader manages to get in”. In the case of deterring criminals, “75% of criminals actively try to avoid breaking into houses when the owners are home”. “In other words, just the fear of being shot is often enough to dissuade criminals from targeting certain homes”. In the event that a criminal might get into your home, the thought that you can kill or injure intruders gives some people peace of mind. Also in rural states in the country such as South Dakota, Idaho, Wisconsin, Kentucky, and Utah, they use guns for sport in hunting. 
In Japan the law relating to guns “ starts with the 1958 act stating, “ No person shall possess a firearm or firearms or a sword or swords”. According to The atlantic.com article A Land Without Guns: How Japan Has Virtually Eliminated Shooting Deaths, “In 2008, the U.S. had over 12 thousand firearm-related homicides, and also in 2008, 587 Americans were killed just by guns that had discharged accidently. In order to get a gun in America according to money.cnn.com, you can go to your local Wal-Mart, or to a gun show. The process is simple, a quick background check is required, social security number is optional, and questions are asked such as “Are you a fugitive from justice? And have you ever been committed to a mental institution? At gun shows a background check is not even required, and denials are rare.  The minimum age requirement to own a gun is 18 years old. In the article A Land Without Guns: How Japan Has Virtually Eliminated Shooting Deaths, “ In 2007 when the death by a gun rate rose to 22 people killed, it became a national scandal.” “ Almost no one in Japan owns a gun”. “ The only guns that Japanese citizens can legally buy and use are shot guns and air rifles, and it’s not easy to do”. In Japan, the laws probably seem outrageous to the average American citizen, who can go into supermarket, and if you have a semi-clean record a citizen can leave with any type of firearm in minutes. “ To get a gun in Japan you have to pass a written test, which is held only once a month, take and pass a shooting range class, go to the hospital for a mental, and drug test and pass a rigorous back ground check”. Even when you own a gun, the regulation by the government continues. “ You provide the police with documentation on the specific location of the gun in your home, and ammunition, which is locked and stored separately, the police inspect the gun once a year, and you are expected to re-take the class and exam every three years”.  Even the way the police hold and operate guns differs immensely in Japan versus in America. In America it Police are required and feel obligated to carry a firearm. They feel that they are the most in power if they know that they have a firearm on hand. If they sense any danger one of their first instincts is to fire their weapon.

guncontrol,comment,Peace process,cw284rg,the_satch,,"I feel like this is a topic that I shouldn't get involved with because there's just not a lot of common sense on both sides, but why not?

The joke in the image you posted is that Americans are taking the second amendment out of context. The second amendment was written when guns carried one round and took upwards of a minute to reload, and when there was the threat of foreign invasion. However, as technology changes, our laws too must change. I doubt anyone who wrote or signed the constitution could even fathom that one day, a gun small enough to fit into a pants pocket would be able enough to kill a small room of people.

Second, the middle ground is pretty clear. One extreme side says gun ownership should be unrestricted. The other extreme side says guns should be banned. However, no one who is taking the issue seriously with respect to peoples' rights is threatening to ban guns. What we need is a regulated system, that includes background checks and periodical re-licencing. Owning weapons designed to hunt and for sport, in this day and age, should be a privilege given to people who have shown they can be responsible. No American needs a weapon designed to kill large quantities of *people*. Not even to protect themselves from this imaginary epidemic of home invasions.

And lastly, the American people do not want to have intelligent discussions involving critical thinking. Our very own leaders solve problems by rudely speaking, loudly, over each other to push an agenda they took with them into the room when they entered and have no intention whatsoever of changing, regardless of any valid argument against it.

We have proven, time and time again, that we are not a responsible society regarding gun ownership. It ruins things for everyone and we're all just gonna have to get the fuck over it.",2015-10-16T20:02:55+00:00

See, this is a very revealing sentence. The gun nut thinks it's the fear of being *shot* that deters the criminal, because when you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. By and large it's more the fear of getting *caught*, not necessarily shot, that acts as the deterrent. That's why this statistic is fairly homogenous on a national level; even in states with strict gun control and little gun ownership the number of homes broken into with the owner present is about the same.

Waiting periods.  Banning AR type rifles (anything modeled after military automatic rifles, even if they're ""only"" semi auto).  Maybe even ban semi auto rifles altogether. Banning high cap magazines.  Raise the purchase age to 21. Red flag laws.

Let's fully find NICS and pay large bounties to gun store owners who report attempted violations.

Let's get creative, though.  Gun manufacturers and the NRA promote & sell these baby killing weapons, specifically the designed-for-human-killing AR platform, because they get money.  Okay, let's go after their money.

We saw some success with the settlement based around the ""man card"" type advertising.  But it will take a lot of settlements to succeed that way.

There are a LOT of steps between a manufacturer wanting to create a gun to sell and getting it into the hands of a prospective baby killer.

Quick aside: some might object to the ""baby killer"" language but let's be clear - they know some of their products will be used to murder babies.  They don't care.  They have done nothing to stop it.  So: ""baby killer.""

Anyway:

Let's find every metal supplier in America and ask them, repeatedly, why they sell steel to companies that build and sell baby killing machines.  Light them up on Twitter.  Some might become uncomfortable and stop selling.    But right now their willing participation in the manufacturer of baby killing machines is ignored.  It's ""just business."" It's capitalism.  It's how markets work.

Same thing for every copper, nickel, plastic, whatever raw material supplier.  All of this can be done to ammunition manufacturers, too.

Those baby killing machines get packaged in cardboard boxes.  Go after the paper companies that sell them boxes.  They have fancy graphics on them.  Go after the marketing companies and the printers.

Those baby killing machines are shipped.  Go after the trucking companies and last mile delivery companies.  Go after the USPS if they're involved.

Now the baby killing machines are in a store.  Let's find out which stores sold guns used to murder babies and other fellow Americans.  Let's post up outside with signs like, ""baby murderers love Bubba's Guns & Ammo."" Of course make sure there's constant streaming video in case someone violently disagrees with the truth.  Other stores shouldn't be let off the hook either.

Ask customers going in & out if they're going to buy a gun or ammo to kill babies like [the latest school shooting].  DON'T GET SQUEAMISH.  These same motherfuckers support people harassing pregnant women in crisis, these tiny brained/dicked men can handle getting the same treatment.

None of these will stop the sale of these baby killing machines, but every success will make them more expensive.  Every missed sale could be a stopped mass shooting.

Do you have family or acquaintances who love guns or own the favorite rifle of baby killers?  Ask them if they like the gun that was used to kill babies.  What specifically do they like about it?  Ask them to tell you about the features that make it particularly good at killing babies.

Civility about guns is dead.  It died for sure after Sandy Hook.  The Republicans pulled a Weekend At Bernie's with it for the past decade, but it's well and truly dead.  The people & for profit corporations who support the continued manufacturer, sale, and civilian ownership of semi automatic rifles modeled on military weapons are evil people.  Full stop.  They support the baby killing at Newtown, at Uvalde, and at the next elementary school shooting that will inevitably happen while we fight like hell to take our local, regional, state, and federal governments back from their evil hands.

The majority of gun deaths are suicide, [nearly 60%](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/16/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/) in fact. However, because these deaths are self-inflicted, people often have a tendency to dismiss them with the argument that guns aren't responsible for these deaths because suicides would happen anyway. This could not be further from the truth. As it turns out, guns have a significant impact on suicide rates. The [Harvard injury control center](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/gun-ownership-and-use/) has a good page on the topic. This [GMU study](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/irlaec/v37y2014icp180-188.html), this [study on the link between access to firearms and suicide](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/393663), and a [study on handgun ownership and suicide in California](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1916744) all find a significant correlation between the prevalence of guns and suicide rates. The main reason why this is the case is because guns make suicide much easier. They provide a quick and painless death. In fact, [suicides by gun have the highest completion rate, at 89.6%](https://www.medpagetoday.com/psychiatry/generalpsychiatry/83665). As a result, those who commit suicide by gun simply don't find other methods to be acceptable. From Cook and Goss's 2020 book (*The gun debate: what everyone needs to know*):

>Teen suicide is particularly impulsive, and if a firearm is readily available, the impulse is likely to result in death. **It is no surprise, then, that households that keep firearms on hand have an elevated rate of suicide for all concerned—the owner, spouse, and teenaged children.** While there are other highly lethal means, such as hanging and jumping off a tall building, **suicidal people who are inclined to use a gun are unlikely to find such a substitute acceptable. Studies comparing the 50 states have found gun suicide rates** (but not suicide with other types of weapons) **are closely related to the prevalence of gun ownership.** It is really a matter of common sense that in suicide, **the means matter.** For families and counselors, a high priority for intervening with someone who appears acutely suicidal is to reduce his or her access to firearms, as well as other lethal means.

The link between making it easier to commit suicide and elevated suicide rates doesn't just apply to guns. Its been noticed long before, pertaining to carbon monoxide gas in [Britain](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1147403?seq=1):

>Between 1963 and 1975 the annual number of suicides in England and Wales showed a sudden, unexpected decline from 5,714 to 3,693 at a time when suicide continued to increase in most other European countries. This appears to be the result of the progressive removal of carbon monoxide from the public gas supply. Accounting for more than 40 percent of suicides in 1963, suicide by domestic gas was all but eliminated by 1975. Few of those prevented from using gas appear to have found some other way of killing themselves.

Removing easy methods of committing suicide drastically decreases suicide rates. This [Harvard article](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/magazine/magazine_article/guns-suicide/) goes over the issue in more depth.

All that said, some argue that this is a good thing, because people should have the right to end their own life, but what they're missing is that the vast majority of the people who commit suicide by gun don't actually want to kill themselves. Such [violent suicides often happen during a depressive episode, within hours or even minutes of the thought of suicide occurring](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/duration/) and [90% of people who attempt suicide do NOT go on to die by suicide later on](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/survival/). The majority of people who attempt suicide regret it shortly after. The reality is that [firearms are a huge risk factor for suicide](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/risk/).

# Guns and Homicide

The next largest group of gun deaths come from homicide. Here too, gun advocates often claim that the removal of guns will not significantly impact homicide rates, yet research shows this to be untrue. Most criminologists and social scientists tend to agree with the fact that guns are linked to increased violence and death. While guns don't necessarily *increase* crime rates, they do greatly intensify crime. Crimes involving guns often much more violent and lead to far more injuries and deaths. The association is clear, more guns lead to more homicides.

According to a book by [Cook and Goss 2020](https://1lib.us/book/2573482/0aa38d):

>Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the conclusion is not “more guns, more crime.” Research findings have been quite consistent in demonstrating that gun prevalence has little if any systematic relationship to the overall rates of assault and robbery. **The strong finding that emerges from this research is that gun use intensifies violence, making it more likely that the victim of an assault or robbery will die.** The positive effect is on the murder rate, not on the overall violent-crime rate. **In other words: more guns, more deaths.**

On top of the research cited by the book, there have been many studies establishing the link between prevalence of guns and homicide, such as [Hemenway and Miller 2000](http://jonathanstray.com/papers/FirearmAvailabilityVsHomicideRates.pdf), [Killias 1993](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1485564/pdf/cmaj00266-0071.pdf), a [literature review by Hemenway and Hepburn](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222182383_Firearm_availability_and_homicide_A_review_of_the_literature). HICRC has a [page](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/) on this as well.

That said, we should keep in mind that there is less research on this topic than there would've been as a result of [NRA's lobbying that resulted in a ban on using federal funds for research on gun violence](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2013/02/gun-violence).

# Guns and Self-defense

The main argument in favor of guns is that guns are important to society because they're primarily used as a method of self-defense, to protect yourself and your property, and that a law-abiding citizen with a gun is the best solution to a criminal with a gun. However, this argument doesn't really hold under scrutiny because research shows that guns are [far more often used to threaten, intimidate, or escalate situations than in self-defense](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/gun-threats-and-self-defense-gun-use-2/):

>Using data from surveys of detainees in six jails from around the nation, we worked with a prison physician to determine whether criminals seek hospital medical care when they are shot. Criminals almost always go to the hospital when they are shot.  **To believe fully the claims of millions of self-defense gun uses each year would mean believing that decent law-abiding citizens shot hundreds of thousands of criminals. But the data from emergency departments belie this claim, unless hundreds of thousands of wounded criminals are afraid to seek medical care.  But virtually all criminals who have been shot went to the hospital, and can describe in detail what happened there.**   
>  
>Victims use guns in less than 1% of contact crimes, and **women never use guns to protect themselves against sexual assault** (in more than 300 cases).  **Victims using a gun were no less likely to be injured after taking protective action than victims using other forms of protective action.  Compared to other protective actions, the National Crime Victimization Surveys provide little evidence that self-defense gun use is uniquely beneficial in reducing the likelihood of injury or property loss.**   
>  
>We found that one in four of these detainees had been wounded, in events that appear unrelated to their incarceration.  Most were shot when they were victims of robberies, assaults and crossfires. **Virtually none report being wounded by a “law-abiding citizen.”** 

Self-defense gun uses [are rather rare, and aren't effective at preventing injury](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25910555/). Additionally, there is a very good chance that most reported self defense gun uses aren't legal to begin with. This [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2648742) took advantage of stand-your-ground laws to assess the resulting increase in death and they find that unlawful homicide make up most of the increases. Also see this [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1730664/), where most judges report that the majority of self defense gun uses were probably illegal.

While the argument that guns enable weaker people to defend themselves makes sense at first, it doesn't hold up to further scrutiny, because more vulnerable groups like women rarely, if at all, use guns in self-defense. 

# Accidents and Gun Safety

Of course, it is rather obvious that more guns result in more unintentional firearm deaths, but it is a noteworthy point, because not everyone properly stores guns, even after training. There research indicates that even with proper training, many people still do not properly store guns. These [two](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/397722) [studies](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/385426) found that firearm training either had no effect or actually increased the storage of guns in an unsafe manner. However, it should be noted that there also [research](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2017.304262) that finds otherwise, so it may be helpful to mandate gun safety and training as a requirement for purchasing a gun.

All that said, it is clear that not everyone receives training, because unintentional deaths continue to happen.

# Economic Cost of Guns

Gun violence is expensive, not just because of the cost of more deaths to the economy, but also the impact of dealing with those deaths and the violence itself. One [report](https://abcnews.go.com/US/gun-violence-cost-america-280-billion-2018-report/story?id=75954550) finds that gun violence costed America around $280 billion in 2018:

>Ted Miller, a health economist and researcher at the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation who worked on the report, pointed to work and quality-of-life costs as the largest. Work losses refer to lost income because of firearm-related death or disability, while quality-of-life costs are more indirect losses from gun violence -- pain, suffering, a loss of well-being for victims and families -- that researchers quantified using jury awards and victim settlements as guides.

This doesn't sound like much, until you consider opportunity cost. i.e what this $280 billion could be used for. Without guns, not only would we have a better average quality of life from the get go, but $280 billion per year would be enough to accomplish a variety of policy objectives. In fact, it alone is enough to pay for a large portion of the $3.5 trillion spending bill proposed by the Democratic party. It would be enough to pass public option health insurance, double the child tax credits and make them permanent thereby ending child poverty as a whole, help low income people pay college tuition, and many more policy proposals that can dramatically improve the overall quality of life in the USA. 

Proper gun control policy can help mitigate this issue:

>Gun policy also may contribute to state gun violence costs, the report found. In Louisiana, among the states with the highest levels of gun deaths, the cost to residents averages out to $1,793 per person each year. In Massachusetts, which has strict gun laws and the lowest rate of gun deaths in the country, the average per-person annual cost is $261.

There are other reports that reach slightly different conclusions, such as this [report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/get-there/wp/2018/02/22/the-enormous-economic-cost-of-gun-violence/) which finds a $229 billion price tag and some others which find similar numbers.

# Effects on other countries

Yes, the effects of lax gun control in America aren't limited to America itself. The flow of guns from the USA to Latin America gets ignored, but [it is a huge issue](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/the-flow-of-guns-from-the-u-s-to-mexico-is-getting-lost-in-the-border-debate):

>Research shows that a majority of guns in Mexico can be traced to the U.S. A report from the U.S Government Accountability Office showed that 70 percent of guns seized in Mexico by Mexican authorities and submitted for tracing have a U.S. origin. This percentage remains consistent, said Bradley Engelbert, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.    
>  
>A [**report**](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/) from the Center of American Progress found that the United States was the primary source of weapons used in crime in Mexico and Canada. Other countries in Central America can also trace a large proportion of guns seized in crimes to the United States. For example, the report found that from 2014 to 2016, 49 percent of crime guns seized in El Salvador were originally purchased in the U.S. In Honduras, 45 percent of guns recovered in crime scenes were traced to the United States as well. 

Lax gun regulation in America exacerbates violent crime across the border, and may even be the cause of some of the refugees showing up to the border, considering that escaping violence and poverty is the primary reason for their entry to the USA. 

Additionally, WaPo has an article documenting [how sniper rifles bought in Houston is being used by drug cartels to murder both American and Mexican policemen](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/mexico-losing-control/mexico-drug-cartels-sniper-rifles-us-gun-policy?itid=hp-more-top-stories).

# Effective Gun control policy

Now, we reach the point where we ask the question, ""what should we do about all this""? Well there is plenty of research indicating that many gun control policies can help mitigate the effects of guns on American (and global) society:

1. Stronger, universal background checks that use federal, state, and local data. This [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22850436/) finds that more background checks are associated with lower homicide rates. This [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-019-04922-x) finds that  universal background checks were associated with a 14.9% reduction in overall homicide rates. And this [study](http://www.taleoftwostates.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Connecticut-Study-Rudolph_AJPH201411682_Final.pdf) finds a 40% reduction in Connecticut. This [article](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2014/repeal-of-missouris-background-law-associated-with-increase-in-states-murders) outlines how repealing licensing law in Missouri led to a significant increase in murders.
2. Removing stand-your-ground laws. Stand-your-ground laws are seen as important for encouraging self-defense, but their overall impact is really just making encounters more dangerous. This [study](https://sci-hub.se/10.3368/jhr.48.3.821) finds that self defense laws increase deaths by 8%. This [study](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/stand-your-ground/violent-crime.html) found that stand your ground laws increased the homicide rate.
3. Wait times. Waiting periods are shown to effectively reduce homicide rates. This [study](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/46/12162) finds that wait times reduced homicide rates by 17% in DC. A Rand article finds that waiting periods decrease [homicides](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/waiting-periods/violent-crime.html) and [suicides](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/waiting-periods/suicide.html). Waiting periods are usually ineffective if the purchaser already has a gun, but it is very effective if someone who doesn't have a gun tries to purchase a gun for nefarious use.
4. Mandatory Gun Safety training. It isn't always effective, but it can help. 
5. Safe storage and Child Access Prevention laws. There's been a decent amount of evidence indicating that gun storage and safety laws significantly reduce injuries and death by guns. This [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/418289) finds that  unintentional firearm deaths among young people fell by 23% in 12 states where safe storage laws had been in effect for at least one year. This [study](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302753) found that states requiring gun locks experienced a 68% lower suicide rate compared with states that had no similar requirement. This [meta-analysis](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/key-findings/what-science-tells-us-about-the-effects-of-gun-policies.html) (and [this](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/child-access-prevention/unintentional-injuries.html)) of 18 different gun policies by the RAND Corporation found that CAP laws have reduced both firearm suicides and accidental shootings among young people. For further reading, see: [this](https://gunsandamerica.org/story/20/07/13/do-safe-storage-gun-laws-prevent-violence/), [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31367924/), and [this](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/199194).

This is by no means a comprehensive list, but the general point is that a society without guns is safer, healthier, and even richer due to the economic cost of guns. Pursuing strong federal gun control reform is more than worth it, though the ideal is a society without guns at all.",2021-10-12T21:17:35+00:00

I have not found any that (at least to my mind) clearly answer the question of if gun laws reduce the murder rate, the mass shooting rate or the suicide rate. So, I figured I’d take a swing at it.

I’m not a professional and I’m not a zealot. I just want the murders and suicides to stop.

So, here is my attempt at analyzing the data I found. Please feel free to constructively rip it apart. I sincerely doubt my analysis is perfect.

SUMMARY

I calculated the Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient between Gun Control Laws and Gun Ownership Rates and Murder, Suicide, Mass Shooting and Mass Shooting Lethality. I found that there is a moderately negative correlation between the strength of gun laws and suicide rates (i.e. gun laws work to reduce suicide rates), and a high positive correlation between the gun ownership rates and the suicide rate. There was no significant correlation between either gun laws or gun ownership rates and the murder rate, mass shooting rate, or mass shooting lethality.

These results suggest it is reasonable to pursue gun control as a means to reduce suicides. (As a point of reference, there are about four times as many suicides as murders.) But, the murder rate (including mass shootings) should also be addressed through other means.

INTRODUCTION

While correlation does not equal causation, it’s pretty hard to imagine causation without correlation. I frequently see the claim that gun control is correlated to a reduction in “gun deaths”, but very rarely do I see credible sources claiming that gun control is correlated to reductions in specific types of gun deaths (suicide, murder... including non-negligent manslaughter, justifiable homicide, and accidents are the subsets that spring to mind). I was also interested in mass shootings and the lethality of mass shootings as they are a trigger for gun control measures.

So, I ran some numbers on my own (using 2019 numbers as they were readily available). The idea was to see if (on a state-by-state level) there are any relationships between the strength of gun control laws or the gun ownership rate and the numbers of suicides, murders, mass shootings and mass shooting fatalities.

MEASURING GUN LAWS

[https://giffords.org/lawcenter/resources/scorecard/](https://giffords.org/lawcenter/resources/scorecard/)

Correlation is a mathematical concept. But, how do you numerically measure the strength of various state-level gun laws? There probably isn’t a good answer to that question, but the best answer seems to be the Giffords Score.

Based on analysis of each state’s gun laws, Giffords gives each state a “school grade” (i.e. A to F) with the “A’s” having the strongest gun laws and the “F’s” having the weakest. Using the 2019 Giffords Grade (as most of the other data comes from 2019 before COVID messed up data collection), I converted each grade to the standard 4-point scale.

It’s not perfect (they are openly pro-gun control and their process is fairly opaque), but I haven’t found anything better.

MEASURING GUN OWNERSHIP RATES

[https://www.rand.org/pubs/tools/TL354.html](https://www.rand.org/pubs/tools/TL354.html)

In 2020, the RAND Corporation conducted a survey to determine the percentage of adults who lived in a household with at least one gun. The results of this survey were used for the gun ownership rates, expressed as a percent of adults, by state, who live in a home with at least one gun.

MEASURING THE SUICIDE RATE

[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/suicide-mortality/suicide.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/suicide-mortality/suicide.htm)

The suicide rate per state was identified using the CDC’s National Center for Heath Statistics “Suicide Mortality by State” report for 2019. These values were expressed as suicides per 100,000 people.

MEASURING THE HOMICIDE RATE

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_U.S.\_states\_and\_territories\_by\_intentional\_homicide\_rate#cite\_note-FBI2020s-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_intentional_homicide_rate#cite_note-FBI2020s-2)

Using data taken from the FBI’s “Crime in the U.S.” and the FBI’s “Crime Data Explorer, the Wikipedia article “List of U.S. states and territories by intentional homicide rate” reports on the intentional homicide rate (i.e. murder and non-negligent manslaughter) for each state. The numbers for 2019 were used and expressed as murders per 100,000 population.

ACCIDENTAL DEATHS BY FIREARM AND JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDES

I was unable to find reliable statistics for these two categories broken out by state. So, I did not analyze either Accidental Deaths or Justifiable Homicides.

MASS SHOOTINGS

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_mass\_shootings\_in\_the\_United\_States\_in\_2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States_in_2023)

Different organizations define mass shootings differently, which presents a bit of an analysis challenge. Wikipedia, in the “List of mass shootings in the United States in 2019” article, has a list that tries to capture all of the events (in 2019) that meet at least two of the definitions from the following organizations: Stanford University MSA Data Project, Mass Shooting Tracker, Gun Violence Archive, Mother Jones, The Washington Post, ABC News and the FBI (they use the same definition), and the Congressional Research Service.

By counting the number of mass shootings and fatalities from mass shootings per state and comparing them with the United States Census Bureau’s population estimates for 2019 ([https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2019/national-state-estimates.html](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2019/national-state-estimates.html)), I was able to come up with rates (per 100,000 population) for both Mass Shootings and Fatalities from Mass Shootings. I did not analyze injuries because injuries should probably be a subsequent analysis.

EVALUATING CORRELATION

At first, I evaluated the data using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. (i.e. “R”). However, I rapidly realized that the data did not appear to be normally distributed (i.e. a bell curve), so I changed to calculating Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient for each comparison. The results were similar.

Correlation coefficients evaluate how tightly two values are correlated using a number between 1 and -1.

A value of 1 shows that the two values are perfectly correlated. For example, consider the function X = Y. As X increases, Y increases the same amount. So, X and Y have a correlation coefficient of 1.

A value of -1 shows a negative correlation. This time, consider the function X = -Y. As X gets bigger, Y gets smaller by the same amount. This time the correlation coefficient is -1.

A value of 0 shows no correlation. Imagine that both X and Y are random numbers, then their correlation coefficient would be 0.

Interpreting the coefficient is fairly simple. Numbers with an absolute number greater than 0.9 (i.e. a number greater than 0.9 or less than -0.9) imply very high correlation. Absolute values between 0.7 and 0.9 imply high correlation, between 0.5 and 0.7 imply moderate correlation, and between 0.3 and 0.5 imply low correlation. Absolute values below 0.3 imply no significant correlation. (This is a fairly standard way to interpret correlation coefficients.)

EVALUATING SUICIDE RATES

Remember that the number of suicides includes those that did not involve a firearm.

Evaluating suicide rates against the Giffords score showed a moderate negative correlation (with a correlation coefficient of -0.60). This suggests that states with stronger gun laws experience fewer suicides.

Evaluating suicide rates against gun ownership rates showed a strong positive correlation (with a correlation coefficient of 0.74). This suggests that states with high gun ownership rates have more suicides.

EVALUATING MURDER RATES

Remember that, for our purposes, murder includes non-negligent manslaughter. These numbers include murders that did not involve the use of a firearm.

Evaluating murder rates against the Giffords score showed no significant correlation (with a correlation coefficient of -0.17). This suggests that states with stronger gun laws do not experience fewer murders.

Evaluating murder rates against gun ownership rates showed no significant correlation (with a correlation coefficient of 0.19). This suggests that states with high gun ownership rates do not experience more murders.

MASS SHOOTINGS

All mass shootings involve firearms. Mass shootings were counted as events per 100,000 population.

Evaluating mass shooting rates against the Giffords score showed no significant correlation (with a correlation coefficient of -0.01). This suggests that states with stronger gun laws do not experience fewer mass shootings.

Evaluating mass shooting rates against gun ownership rates showed no significant correlation (with a correlation coefficient of 0.19). This suggests that states with high gun ownership rates do not experience more mass shootings.

MASS SHOOTING FATALITIES

A common argument for some gun laws (specifically high-capacity magazine bans, “assault weapon” bans, and bans on automatic and semi-automatic firearms) is that, while they may not stop the shooting, they will decrease the number of fatalities. To evaluate that, we used the rate of mass shooting fatalities per 100,000 population.

Evaluating mass shooting fatality rates against the Giffords score showed no significant correlation (with a correlation coefficient of -0.10). This suggests that states with stronger gun laws do not experience fewer mass shootings fatalities.

Evaluating mass shooting fatality rates against gun ownership rates showed no significant correlation (with a correlation coefficient of 0.04). This suggests that states with high gun ownership rates do not experience more mass shootings fatalities.

CONCLUSIONS

I found evidence that gun control laws correlate to a lower suicide rate. But, I did not find evidence that they correlate to a lower murder rate, lower mass shooting rate, or a reduction in the lethality of mass shootings.

This is not an argument against gun control (there are almost four times as many suicides as murders in this country), but we may need to accept that gun control is not a silver bullet solution to our nations homicide rate and should be combined with other strategies.

It is also possible that there are confounding variables that I have not considered. Perhaps states with historically higher murder rates have created stricter gun control laws which have brought them back to ""normal"". Perhaps stricter gun control laws will begin to influence the murder rate. If I have missed something, hopefully someone will point it out.",2023-06-01T10:37:36+00:00

Saying we support gun control laws but also support the 2A is a self-defeatist stance. It plays right into the hands of the NRA, and it doesn't generate the much-needed grassroots gun control movements.

We need to grow a spine and push for the 2A repeal. Make repealing the 2A an Overton Window. Because of the 2A, the Supreme Court can strike down any gun control laws, saying it's unconstitutional. The New York permit laws is the most recent example. The 2A is a stumbling block to sensible gun control laws, so it needs to go.
