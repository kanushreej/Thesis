Back in the 90s you had to wait until you could get Medicare/Medicaid I'm thinking it was 6 months.

The insurance I had at the time was a closed system so I’m not sure if going to an urgent care clinic was an option. That might have been something I’d pay 100% out of pocket for.

Have lowest possible 2.5% interest on mortgage, pay way below any rental.  House is perfect for mobility and location with schools and doctors.
Forced to sell, if a buyer can find insurance.  This state doesn’t care about Floridians, it’s leadership has gotten worse and worse.  
The two options we were given DO Not Even Have Flood Insurance how is that not apart of the policy??????  There’s so much fine print they won’t cover anything.   They took payment last week when month rolled over as soon as they did they sent a message saying if catastrophe happens they have the right to not pay us or do anything for us.
We just paid Thousands of dollars for a company to do nothing so our mortgage is happy that the words Insured Property in system so mortgage company doesn’t try take.

Unreal, all the BS back and forth with politicians that do nothing but having fun playing school yard bullies, and people keep putting same types of people in place.

So we’ll be homeless soon the money we will make from sale if we can find buyer won’t last long, Can’t buy in FL with insurance issue, can’t afford to move and can’t afford to pay for people to help us move.

Democrats,post,Medicaid,1bpt5s4,John3262005,GOP plans for Medicaid cuts could face backlash,"Former President Trump's recent promise not to cut entitlement programs is notably silent on Medicaid — but GOP ambitions for shrinking the safety-net health care program could risk backlash similar to the party's Obamacare repeal debacle.

The Republican Study Committee, an influential group of House conservatives, released a budget last week that calls for converting Medicaid from an open-ended entitlement into block grants.

The Project 2025 plan from the Heritage Foundation also calls for caps on Medicaid spending.

Strong resistance from the health industry — and even some Republican governors worried about the impact in their states — helped sink a Republican proposal to cap Medicaid funding during the failed 2017 ACA repeal effort.

The ACA and its Medicaid expansion has only grown more ingrained since then, and there are signs that GOP opposition in the 10 holdout states is starting to soften.

President Biden, meanwhile, has boasted about Medicaid expansion enrollment as he makes health care a big focus of his reelection effort.

Today's GOP is further right than than the one that abandoned ACA repeal in 2017.

Trump has repeatedly expressed vague interest in revisiting the ACA, which could mean changes to the Medicaid expansion. Trump's campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

Republicans are pushing for other changes short of spending caps that could significantly reshape Medicaid.

Former Trump administration health official Brian Blase, now president of the Paragon Health Institute, is calling for reducing the federal government's 90% share of Medicaid expansion costs, which is much higher than its usual match rate.

It would also push more costs onto states, which ACA supporters argue could discourage the remaining holdout states from expanding or even prompt some expansion states to drop coverage.

Some Republican states are also looking to revive rules tying Medicaid enrollment to employment, which could result in enrollment cuts.

Work rules approved by the Trump administration got bogged down in legal challenges.",2024-03-28T11:23:46+00:00

But to answer your question, subsidies help you buy insurance. The public option would exist to compete with insurance. 

Subsidies can have the effect of driving inflation of prices as companies price in what they understand to be the base subsidy. 

Competition drives down or reduces the prospect of inflation in prices because, assuming commoditization of the market and the ability to view the various offerings as interchangeable substitutes, consumers will typically gravitate to the lowest cost alternative. This is one reason why establishing a floor and tiers in the marketplace are also important.

Democrats,comment,Pre-existing conditions,dh18vxb,timbenj77,,"I don't think this is an assertion that you have to follow some letter of religion.

Full quote: ""“That helps offset all these costs, thereby reducing the cost to those people who lead good lives, they’re healthy, they’ve done the things to keep their bodies healthy. And right now those are the people—who’ve done things the right way—that are seeing their costs skyrocketing.”

If you jump to the assumption that he means pass some religious test from that quote, you're doing us a disservice.  This is the classic personal-responsibility concept that conservatives advocate. Translation: if you develop cancer despite no major risk factors, then you should be covered. But if you have a diet that consists of Big Macs, pizza, soda and donuts - then marathon runners shouldn't be forced to pay for your medical expenses relating to type 2 diabetes.

It's a noble concept and it would be great if we could implement some degree of common sense measure of implementing it. The problem is that there's so much grey area in terms of deciding what should or should not be covered that it opens the door to bias and corruption, and administrative costs arguably negate the savings.

On the flip side of the coin, this is why conservatives oppose any kind of gun control legislation. Many agree with mandatory background checks, but beyond that is where it gets fuzzy. What, in a background check, should bar a person from legally owning a firearm? ",2017-05-02T16:08:24+00:00

Far too often, it still has so much stigma attached to it, that a lot of people who could likely receive some benefit from it avoid seeking mental health care until they have suffered severe effects or crises. People need to see seeking mental health treatment as normal as seeing your physical health doctor once or twice a year, going to the dentist, etc.

And the Biden administration could be at the forefront of promoting such normalization. I think pushing insurers to cover it more widely is a good first step, but if people are still afraid to seek treatment in the first place, then it's kind of putting the cart before the horse.

Biden could team up with Fetterman, who can not only speak from experience, but his work in advocating for marijuana legalization as Lt. Governor of PA was a perfect example of advocating for a controversial opinion.",2023-07-26T12:19:41+00:00

No, it was telling you to believe medical experts. 

Because no shit. We don't consult Joe the homeless guy when we want to send a rocket to Mars, we consult the experts who's job it is to know this, who studied it for longer than the confederacy existed. 

>They needed you to believe that this heroic effort by the government and big pharma, to produce a barely tested technology was going to be safe

Vaccines have been around for over 100 years, and inoculation dates back to ancient Greece and Rome. It's been tested plenty of times. So many in fact, that we keep a sample of polio and smallpox in vials just to laugh at when we want to flex our superiority. Vials that would not exist without vaccines, because those viruses would still be around and thriving. 

>And then they told you that anybody who questions that narrative is ""adjacent to"" these crackpots who said things like 5G nanobots, magnetic skin, lizard people, etc

None of the dinglehoppers ""questioning"" it had any grounds. It was just baseless conjecture and conspiracy theories. At their core, they were questioning it because they wanted any excuse to wimp out of a harmless 2 second needle.

A strong majority of Democrats — 69 percent — back the idea. Republicans oppose single-payer, 65-35, and independents are split, with 51 percent opposing and 49 supporting.

35% of republicans responded favorably to single-payer healthcare... contrast that with 12% when asked about the ACA.

I think we might be onto something here...

[Poll results](http://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/HHP-September-Wave_Topline-Memo_No-Banners_Registered-Voters.pdf)

> This survey was conducted online within the United States between September 17-20,
2017 among 2,177 registered voters by The Harris Poll.
The results reflect a nationally representative sample. Results were weighted for age within
gender, region, race/ethnicity, marital status, household size, income, employment,
political party, political affiliation, and education where necessary to align them with their
actual proportions in the population. Propensity score weighting was also used to adjust for
respondents’ propensity to be online.

Lot of interesting things to glean off this poll, but I was particularly surprised with the responses on single payer, given the wording of the ***endless*** questions on the issue.... it's like they were trying to wear the respondents out so people could cherry pick questions to use as talking points.

> Do you favor or oppose so-called single-payer healthcare plans in which the government
 collects taxes and pays for all healthcare and private health insurers are eliminated?

52%Favor - 48%Oppose

>  Do you think the government should be the provider of health insurance for
 all or should it only subsidize healthcare for the poor and the elderly?

51%Favor - 49%Oppose

> Do you think single-payer systems run by the government are the best way to run healthcare
 or do you think competition from private insurers is the best way to run healthcare?

50%/50% (favor slight edge)

> Do you think that opening up the Medicare program to everyone makes sense or would it be fiscally irresponsible?

50%/50% (favor slight edge)

>  Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are advocating a single-payer plan they call Medicare for all. Based
 on what you have heard, do you favor this plan, oppose it, or don't have enough information yet on it?

33%favor - 29%oppose - 38%more info

Now this is a very fair statement.  I remember (again, not that this was a very high bar as far as debates go, lol) listening to him debate Rudy Giuliani, probably back before the 2016 Election (though it could have been before the 2018 midterms I guess) about taxation.

Giuliani was on the Republican talking point regarding a tax holiday to repatriate huge amounts of money U.S. companies were holding overseas and Mark Cuban...*as an actual person in control of a company with such holdings...*told him it was a waste of time.  It would do nothing but be a big tax holiday to people like himself \[M.C.\] and do nothing to stimulate the economy.

Rudy walked right into the trap with the ""but then they'll create jobs with the money!"" to which Mark replied, ""If I can make money creating jobs in the U.S., I'll do it right now.  I can borrow at what amounts to practically zero percent interest against the money I'm holding overseas without any tax penalty at all.  Companies only create jobs when there's a financial incentive to fulfil some service that requires them, not because you just happen to have money Mr. Giuliani.""",2022-06-07T19:17:59+00:00

Democrats,post,unnecessary tests,9qji18,deaconheel,Pro-Choice is the Only Choice,"This one might ruffle some feathers, but let’s give it a try. If you want a society with fewer abortions, your only choice is to vote for Democrats. That is the only party with a platform that will actually reduce the number of abortions - access to birth control, comprehensive sex education, expanding access to health care like Planned Parenthood (most importantly prenatal care), even affordable education and early childcare/welfare/food stamps to provide economic assistance after birth make a huge impact on the frequency of abortions. Not coincidentally, these are the planks of the Democratic platform. 

The Republican answer is to simply ban the medical practice, which doesn’t prevent abortions but makes them less safe for the mothers. Outlawing abortions also fails to acknowledge the instances in which abortions are a medical necessity or the least bad of two choices. It’s not a good choice, but is one that many hopeful mothers are forced to make - when the genetic or ultrasound tests show that the fetus will not survive the pregnancy or the birth. It is a terrible decision but one that a mother/father must make with the physician.  Sometimes that heartbreaking choice is not available until after 20 weeks. The Republicans insert themselves between a women and her OB/GYN with unnecessary testing and sometimes force the physician to lie. 

I understand that some people see this as a black and white issue, but as with most things in life, the practice is quite gray. There are legitimate, medical reasons for abortions or induced miscarriages, and they are all sad and terrible. Even if there wasn’t a medical reason, this should be a decision a woman gets to make for her own self, her own body. The answer isn’t to make the women criminals or punish the physicians. The answer is to make the practice an unnecessary as possible and that is where Democratic policies win the argument hands down. ",2018-10-22T23:57:55+00:00

Democrats,post,unnecessary tests,5whtig,QuietCalamity,AZ Call to Action week of 2/27/17,"Via AZ LD27:

This update opens with a reality check. At this point in the legislative session, many bills have passed through committee, meaning we can no longer comment on them using RTS. This is the point where we have to get more vocal. Call your senators and representatives. Send them emails (always with the bill number and your position in the subject line). Write letters to the editors of various publications. Talk to your friends about what’s going on. Show up and speak at committee meetings for the bills for which you are most passionate. And consider making appointments with your senator and representatives to share your views with them personally. Advocating loudly in a variety of ways makes us visible, and visible citizens are more powerful. This is no time to be complacent!  

Good news: HB2287, which would have gutted Shannon’s Law by allowing the discharge of firearms 1/4 mile from an occupied structure (the bullet that killed Shannon Smith came from 1/2 mile away), has been amended. The distance language has been dropped from the bill, leaving the 1-mile range as is. Now only a few words are changing: “criminal negligence” to “intentionally, knowingly or recklessly.” THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE HOUSE and heads to Senate Government Committee Wednesday. The removal of criminal negligence as a standard is still concerning so I still suggest you OPPOSE this bill.

Tentative good news: The ESA (voucher) bills have still not advanced to the floor. Perhaps this means our voices are being heard and the bills don’t have the votes to pass? We must pay attention and stay vigilant. Continue to contact your representatives and senator with your opposition.  

Bad news: Constitutional rights on fire! Our Legislature seems to be gunning for citizens’ voting and health rights. On Thursday night, the House passed a package of bills that would make sweeping changes to the Arizona Constitution’s initiative process, and not to the benefit of voters. The Senate passed another bill packaged as “anti-abortion” but written so broadly that it would cause a great deal of pain to bereaved families, as well as danger to doctors for doing their jobs ethically.

You may be asking: WHAT CAN I DO?

Top priority: the three Urgent Alerts below. Contact the House Speaker and Senate President to demand they stop the worst bills, contact your reps and senator now with your opposition, and attend committee meetings if you can to speak in person.

If you have 30-45 minutes: Scan the RTS listings and use the system to support or oppose bills in committee.

If you have 60+ minutes: Call your reps and senator (as applicable) on all the bills headed to the floor for a vote.

 

URGENT ALERT #1: Protect our Right to Peaceful Assembly

 

SB1142: Once again, Arizona is making international news. This bill opens those who participate in or help organize a protest-turned-riot up to criminal racketeering charges, including significant jail time and seizure of assets. Even if no violence occurs, law enforcement can prosecute under racketeering laws if they think a riot might occur. Planners can be charged with racketeering even if they had nothing to do with the act of violence. The bill also expands the definition of “riot” to include disturbing the peace or destruction of property. This bill is justifiably receiving a lot of press attention: AZ Capitol Times article, AZ Republic article and columns, and international news.

 

THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE SENATE and is now headed to the House. The next step is for the Speaker to assign it to a committee. We should try to stop it there. Contact Speaker JD Mesnard (R-17) TODAY (602-926-4481 / jmesnard@azleg.gov) to urge him to refuse to assign this bill to committee. If he does this, the bill will die. How wonderful would it be if he arrived to his office on Monday morning to find his voice mail full? We can make that happen.  

URGENT ALERT #2: OPPOSE the Gutting of Voters’ Rights 

On Thursday night, the House passed a package of bills that would make sweeping changes to the Arizona Constitution’s initiative process, and not to the benefit of voters. Arizona Republic article here. HCR2029 is in Rules for Monday (see the RTS section below) and will almost certainly move to the floor this week. The other four bills are not yet on committee agendas:

HCR2002: Asks voters to repeal Proposition 105, a citizen-initiated measure that voters approved in 1998 and is commonly known as the Voter Protection Act.

HCR2007: Would exempt citizen referenda from the Voter Protection Act. That means if voters decided to overturn a law passed by the Legislature, lawmakers could go back and pass the same law, something the Voter Protection Act currently prohibits.

HB2320: Require a notice on the ballot, fundraising material and advertising related to initiatives that they can only be changed in the future by a three-quarters vote in the Legislature and if the change furthers the purpose of the original ballot measure.

HB2404: Throws up potentially insurmountable barriers to signature-gathering by requiring petition circulators to post a bond of up to $50,000, requiring background checks on signature gatherers, and making them take classes and certify they understand state law on initiatives.

 

We should try to stop these bills before they get assigned to committee. Contact Senate President Steve Yarbrough (R-17) TODAY (602-926-5863 / syarbrough@azleg.gov) and urge him NOT to assign any of these bills to a committee. If he does this, the bills will die. How wonderful would it be if he arrived to his office on Monday morning to find his voice mail full? We can make that happen.

 

URGENT ALERT #3: Stand up for Health & Reproductive Rights 

SB1367: Requires documentation by physicians and all staff present that an aborted fetus was not delivered alive, regardless of gestational age. Would require doctors to take unnecessary medical steps for a wanted child born too early to live or with a fatal defect that assures its death. Arizona Republic article here. Sponsored by Center for Arizona Policy, an extreme right-wing dark money group. THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE SENATE and is headed to the House. Contact House Speaker J.D. Mesnard (R-17) (602-926-4481 / jmesnard@azleg.gov) to urge him to NOT schedule this bill for a committee hearing.

 

SB1439: Would let health care providers continue trying to keep a person alive even if the person wants no more medical services. Sponsored by Center for Arizona Policy, an extreme right-wing dark money group. THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE SENATE and is headed to the House. Contact House Speaker J.D. Mesnard (R-17) (602-926-4481 / jmesnard@azleg.gov) to urge him to NOT schedule this bill for a committee hearing.

 

 

 

 

 

Headed to the floor for a vote! Contact your legislators.

 

SB1122: Prohibit local government from requiring anyone to search a national database in order to transfer personal property. Passed through committee, held in consent (object). Contact your senator to OPPOSE.

 

SB1198: Would greatly weaken ability to enforce the ADA in Arizona and restricts civil rights of the disabled. Businesses and public places have had over 30 years to comply with the ADA and do not need any further leeway.  Strongly opposed by the disability community. Headed to Senate COW. Contact your senator to OPPOSE.

 

SB1243: Requires operators of public establishments (including businesses, but excluding universities, courtrooms, high schools) to permit all persons with gun permits to carry their firearms inside unless the facility has security guards and metal detectors. Scheduled for Senate COW on Monday. Call your senator to OPPOSE.

 

SB1253: Allows police to review video of a use-of-force incident before making a statement, in violation of recommended best practices of many civil rights groups. Passed Senate COW, headed to the floor. Contact your senator to OPPOSE.

 

SB1315: Gives preference in custody to the parent who agrees to 50% time sharing. It harms battered women and those protecting abused children. If they are not willing to give 50% time, they may lose custody to the abuser. This bill passed out of committee and is headed to the Senate floor. Contact your senator to OPPOSE.

 

HCM2006: Urges repeal of the federal clean energy program with a coal program. PASSED Energy, Environment and Natural Resources Committee 2/14, Rules 2/20. Headed to the floor. Contact your representatives to OPPOSE.

 

HB2444: Allows for privileged communication (similar to doctor-patient confidentiality) between an assault victim and a victim advocate. PASSED House Judiciary & Public Safety Committee and Rules unanimously. Headed to the floor for a vote. Contact your reps to SUPPORT.

 

HB2482: Amends rules on worker’s compensation pools to require an employee using the pool to use a specific medical provider. Passed committee 2/20, held in consent calendar (object). Contact your reps to OPPOSE.

 

SCM1008: Urges Congress to raise the ozone concentration standard. Passed Natural Resources Committee. This bill has passed out of committee and is headed to the floor. Call your senator to OPPOSE.

 

SCM1009: Urges the removal of the gray wolf from Endangered Species listings. Passed Natural Resources Committee. This bill has passed out of committee and is headed to the floor. Call your senator to OPPOSE.

 

SCM1011: Asks Congress to repeal/amend the Antiquities Act to remove large swaths of Arizona land from national monument designation. Passed Natural Resources Committee. This bill has passed out of committee and is headed to the floor. Call your senator to OPPOSE.

 

RTS: Crossover Edition 

We are starting to see many bills passing their originating house. For these bills, the committee hearings (and RTS) now start all over again in the other house. Because of this, I am now listing bills by day of the week instead of by house.

 

Please note that for RTS, the comment follows the committee, not the bill. If you have entered RTS positions for these bills before, you will have to do them again for the new committee.

 

Monday……………………………………………………………………………………………………………..

 

HB2210: Establishes state funding for a college readiness examination for 11th graders. The test must already be administered nationwide and must be already used by colleges for admissions purposes. Supported by public education advocates. Passed Education and Appropriations, now heads to Rules. SUPPORT.

 

HCR2029: Requires signature collectors to get 10% of their signatures from each of the 30 legislative districts, 15% for a constitutional amendment. Effectively gives one legislative district veto powers over the rest. Clearly designed to make the initiative process impossibly difficult. AZ Republic covered it here. Passed House Appropriations, scheduled for Rules Monday. OPPOSE.

 

SB1317: Would allow any certified teacher to provide special education services, theoretically to give the IEP team the flexibility to decide who would be the best provider. Opposed by teachers on the grounds that not just anyone can teach special ed and that certification means something. THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE SENATE and is scheduled for House Education on Monday. OPPOSE.

 

SB1479: Requires behavioral health providers to accompany police on a mental health transportation order. It is unnecessary and the behavioral health system is already woefully overburdened. ""Tagging along"" will only pull workers from other needed areas (such as crisis prevention). Passed Senate Health and Human Services, scheduled for Rules Monday. OPPOSE.

 

Tuesday……………………….…………………………………………………………………………………..

 

SCM1001: Urges the President and Congress repeal the definition of critical habitat as including areas in which a species' presence is difficult to establish through surveys. THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE SENATE and is scheduled for House Energy, Environment and Natural Resources Tuesday. OPPOSE.

 

Wednesday………………………………………………………………………………………………………..

 

SB1239: Makes it a violation to park in the hatch area of a disabled spot. From a disability advocate: “(This bill) is not coming as an ask from those who use (disabled spots). In fact, to swing the car door wide enough for entry and exit, we often have to pull a bit into the hatch mark zone.” THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE SENATE and is scheduled for House Transportation & Infrastructure Wednesday. OPPOSE.

 

HB2022: Legalizes shooting rats and snakes with your .22 (yes, really). THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE HOUSE and is scheduled for Senate Government Wednesday. OPPOSE.

 

HB2017: Requires school bond publicity pamphlets to include the estimated total cost of a bond at the maximum interest rate and the estimated interest rate based on current market conditions. ASBA opposes. THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE HOUSE and is scheduled for Senate Finance Committee. OPPOSE.

 

HB2216: Would prohibit local government from requiring the search of a national database before the sale of guns between private owners. (This bill is being fast-tracked; see companion bill SB1122.) THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE HOUSE and is scheduled for Senate Government for Wednesday. OPPOSE.

 

HB2226: Calls for Congress to request an Article V convention to balance the budget. This would not go to the public for a vote or allow any input from citizens on budget priorities. Most progressives and some conservatives are adamantly opposed to Article V conventions as there is no control of them once they have been convened. THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE HOUSE and is scheduled for Senate Government Committee. OPPOSE.

 

HB2287: Would have gutted Shannon’s Law by allowing the discharge of firearms 1/4 mile from an occupied structure. (The bullet that killed Shannon Smith came from 1/2 mile away.) This language has been dropped from the bill. Now replaces “criminal negligence” with the words “intentionally, knowingly or recklessly.” The removal of criminal negligence as a standard is still concerning. THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE HOUSE and heads to Senate Government Committee Wednesday. OPPOSE.

 

Thursday….………………………………………………………………………………………………………..

 

HB2086: Prohibits local government from issuing a municipal ID. People who are not official residents of Arizona need these ID cards for all kinds of things – library card, cashing a check, using a credit card, etc. THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE HOUSE and is assigned to Senate Government Committee for Thursday. OPPOSE.

 

HB2238: Would remove the non-dangerous convictions of victims of sexual trafficking, many of whom are minors (for example, prostitution). THIS BILL HAS PASSED THE HOUSE and is assigned to Senate Judiciary. SUPPORT.

Progressive,comment,Affordable Care Act,cr8gxys,Baroliche,,"Independent voter here (who voted for Obama).  Nothing funny about the below.  While liberals and conservatives shoot flaming arrows at one another, this is what happens to the common folk.

Had a PPO plan with $1500 deductible and $3k out of pocket max.  I paid $650 a month for it and had relationships with doctors 10+ years.

1. Plan was cancelled

2. Lost My Doctors

3. Insurance companies not ready for roll out, could not even get new number until end of January 2014.  Went 10k into debt paying bills out of pocket for various medical needs as well as a special needs son so he could stay in programs that had waiting lists (they would bring in someone who would pay if we would not).  I had insurance, I just did not have a card or even a number I could give them to bill.  

4. New plans have more than 2X my old deductibles. Max out pockets are > $10k and the plans cost $100's more per month.  None of my doctors know if they will take any of the plans (not for lack of decision, they had not been given the billing rates yet).

5. Equivalent plan to mine costs just over 2x my old plan, I buy that one for $1300 a month.  Next lower is $200 cheaper but deductibles were $4500 out of pocket max north of $10k.  

6. Got new doctors

7. Lost them too because even though they were listed by the insurance co, they did not really take the plan. (Class action lawsuit announced against insurance co for that one)

8. Spent 150+ hours on phone trying to recoup funds paid out of pocket.  Got a fraction of it back as what the new insurance pays and what I pay turned out to be different.  No one knew at the time as the billing rates had not even been published when I was billed.

I would be happy to verify any of the above with a trustworthy mod if you think I am full of shit.  

This isn't comedy hour, it's peoples lives that got jacked up while two political parties acted like children.  I was lucky, some people had it way worse.

Desperate people who are fed-up are more prone to take chances as they've got little to lose. From their perspective Hillary wasn't different to Trump in the regards you mention. The devil you know vs. the one you don't know. They made their pick. All she had to do to beat Trump was support one of the progressive narratives people are rallying around. Instead she waffled. BLM, 15, dakota pipeline etc. Any of them would've mobilized concerned citizens and given her the edge she needed. Instead they stayed at home or voted for the hand-grenade out of spite, to see how it would turn out.

At this point the parties are near identical twins in that they're both controlled by wall street money. Both blinded by the gravy-train and their own greed to keep it going. Four years ago democrats laughed at the republicans red scare tactics. Today Comey and Russia are MSM distractions to the real underlying issues. Injustice, inequality and corruption.

The American system is a gamble. You could very well get off lucky and not have to spend money on it, but there is also a large chance that you end up overpaying drastically. It is statistically proven that even you as an individual are better off ""paying for someones else healthcare"", even though it may not be too intuitive.

My health insurance is one of the reasons that I am still alive today. But my insurance plan is also utilizing a tool that harms patients like me – called copay accumulators.

For years now, insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers have added language into health plans that allow them to deny third-party financial assistance towards a patient’s deductible or out-of-pocket maximum.  Essentially, it allows them to pocket the assistance that patients are given through charities or drug manufacturers, and still charge us for the same amount.

My family’s plan, which most Floridians also have, is Florida Blue. But the most research from The AIDS Institute shows that all 14 carriers participating in Florida’s Affordable Care Act Marketplace are applying some form of accumulators for prescription drugs. This policy is harming thousands of Florida patients, because we’re forced to choose between paying for treatment and paying for things such as rent, childcare, and groceries – all to protect the insurance company’s bottom line.

Having to choose between being alive or keeping a roof over my family’s head is a heartbreaking decision that we unfortunately must make frequently.

Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem. Rep. Lindsay Cross and Sen. Tom Wright have introduced HB 1063 and SB 46, respectively, both of which would ban copay accumulator programs in Florida. Bills like this have passed in 16 other states, and Congress has reintroduced a bipartisan bill several times that would ban copay accumulators. But here in the Sunshine State, it’s failed to advance three years in a row.

We can’t let that happen again. There are lives here that depend on it. “

These bills will mean a world of difference for me and my family. It is time for the Florida legislature to prioritize patient lives and not insurance.",2023-04-07T08:33:33+00:00

HOW WE GOT HERE


2000: If Gore had slightly higher turnout in Florida by 0.009% (about 540 more votes) George W. Bush might not have been able to appoint two Justices during his second term.

2014: The 2014 midterms had the lowest voter turnout since World War II, giving Republicans a significant edge in the Senate races. If Democratic voter turnout had been a few percentage points higher we wouldn't have lost the Senate, and McConnell wouldn't have had the power to hold open a Supreme Court Vacancy.

2016: Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump by 77,000 votes spread across three states, about 0.0057% of all votes cast. If Clinton's turnout had been just 1% higher in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio then she could have prevented Donald Trump from winning the election and appointing three pro-life Justices to the Supreme Court.

Slightly higher turnout in 2000 could have prevented us from losing two Supreme Court Seats.

Slightly higher turnout in 2014 could have prevented us from losing at least one (but as many as three) Supreme Court Seats, and the 2016 Presidential election.",2023-03-08T22:36:25+00:00

If you had, for example, a blue-dog Democrat or Republican in office, two groups who opposed the public option in healthcare reform, it would in all likelihood be vetoed even if it did manage to pass both houses of Congress.

Until we reform our elections, liberals and progressives need to work harder to fix the party we sorta do have. Vote in primaries. Vote in local elections. Take every single election seriously--if there's no satisfactory candidate, find one and make them run. If you can't, run yourself. There is a system for making the party be what you want, and many of the people bitching don't even make the bare minimum effort.

If you absolutely must write the Democratic Party off, start small. Winning local elections gives a party legitimacy, which is can use to win state elections, etc. Even if you can never make the leap to national elections, you've succeeded in dragging the Overton Window leftward. 

All of this will shift the window, in fact. Running liberals and winning with them on the local level matters. It really does. We need to drag the discourse back where we need it to be.

For a disease that has, often, no outward symptoms and a public that was so terrified of this new ailment, I can see why this restriction was initially put in place.

With that said, we now have the testing ability (and do so with every single blood product donation) to filter out and flag any samples that have HIV.

That's not the only upside. The other benefit to single payer is the elimination of adverse selection. Without universal coverage, only those with the highest expected medical costs will seek coverage, while those with lower costs won't, causing the average price of insurance to increase. 

Side note relevant to my next point: single payer does not necessarily mean the elimination of deductibles or co-pays. 

>The downside is that you would pay more in taxes. But if you are paying for medical insurance now you're paying either way. Only one sounds scarier than the other.

That's not the only downside. Without deductibles or co-pays, moral hazard and unnecessary doctor visits will increase. With zero cost to seek medical services, people have the incentive to seek medical services for every slight thing. ",2017-05-12T21:17:44+00:00

Progressive,comment,single payer,dhiiamd,Dwayne_Jason,,"Well, I'm not sure about NHS but I'm from Canada and the healthcare system works here is that the doctors have their own union which deals with the fed government to receive pay increases, etc. Everyone has a healthcare which is like one's own medical account, which gets charged by the doc and the government would pay for it. So there's a private element there, but its fully subsidized by the government. 

I think the problem with single payer is an economic one. There are several economic problems that one deals with when subsidizing a private industry and allowing firms to only provide services based on monetary incentive. 

The most obvious one is the public/rival good issue. If you have a single pot of money, it's gonna be used up quickly if the firms have a choice in how much they want from the pot. 

Secondly is the price ceiling. If a government wants to set up a budget, on this money pot they will want to set up price ceilings on certain services so they are not overused, but since single payer creates a huge demand change, equilibrium will rise, prices will rise, and a price ceiling leads to a shortage. 

Healthcare, IMO, needs to be universal and needs complete removal of private services for essential needs. These things have a very inelastic demand curve ie. you'll pay whatever the doctor asks you to pay. There's no room for negotiation. You can't just ignore a hernia. It's not ideological either, economically the healthier people are, the more productive they are, reduces bankruptcy rates. 

Now, of course, there are problems within universal healthcare as well; like why should you pay for someone's cigarette habit? And there is a valid argument there but I think essential services like the ER is a good first step. ",2017-05-13T17:56:27+00:00

Progressive,post,unnecessary tests,15yabpb,shallah,"Doctors, patients try to shame insurers online to reverse authorization denials: “They just delay and delay and delay until you die. And you’re absolutely helpless as a patient.”","

Prior authorization is a common cost-cutting tool used by health insurers that requires patients and doctors to secure approval before moving forward with many tests, procedures, and prescription medications. Insurers say the process helps them control costs by preventing medically unnecessary care. But patients say the often time-consuming and frustrating rules create hurdles that delay or deny access to the treatments they need. In some cases, delays and denials equal death, doctors say.


That’s why desperate patients like Nix — and even some physicians — say they have turned to publicly shaming insurance companies on social media to get tests, drugs, and treatments approved.

“Unfortunately, this has become a routine practice for us to resort to if we don’t get any headway,” said Dr. Shehzad Saeed, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Dayton’s Children’s Hospital in Ohio. In March, he tweeted a photo of an oozing skin rash, blaming Anthem for denying the biologic treatment his patient needed to ease her Crohn’s disease symptoms.

Snip

“They take in premiums and don’t pay claims. That’s how they make money,” said Dr. Linda Peeno, a health care consultant and retired Kentucky physician who was employed as a medical reviewer by Humana in the 1980s and later became a whistleblower. “They just delay and delay and delay until you die. And you’re absolutely helpless as a patient.”

But there’s reason to hope things may get marginally better. Some major insurers are voluntarily revamping their prior authorization rules to ease preapproval mandates for doctors and patients. And many states are passing laws to rein in the use of prior authorization.

“Nobody is saying we should get rid of it entirely,” said Todd Askew, senior vice president for advocacy at the American Medical Association, in advance of the group’s annual meeting in June. “But it needs to be right-sized, it needs to be simplified, it needs to be less friction between the patient and accessing their benefits.”

Customers are increasingly using social media to air their complaints across all industries, and companies are paying attention. Nearly two-thirds of complainants reported receiving some sort of response to their online post, according to the 2023 “National Consumer Rage Survey,” conducted by Customer Care Measurement & Consulting in collaboration with Arizona State University.


Some research suggests companies are better off engaging with unhappy customers offline, rather than responding to public social media posts. But many patients and doctors believe venting online is an effective strategy, though it remains unclear how often this tactic works in reversing prior authorization denials.

“It’s not even a joke. The fact that that’s how we’re trying to get these medications is just sad,” said Dr. Brad Constant, an inflammatory bowel disease specialist who has published research on prior authorization. His work found that prior authorizations are associated with an increased likelihood that children with inflammatory bowel disease will be hospitalized.",2023-08-22T16:10:13+00:00

This is the one thing that has bothered me most about ""conservatism"" in the U.S.  It seems obvious that if people want to reduce abortions, comprehensive sex education and widely accessible-birth control are the way to go.  Also, addressing some social and economic factors would also be important, because economic factors do also drive demand for abortion, i.e. people are more likely to want to get abortions if they feel they can't support kids, especially if their circumstances change suddenly after they get pregnant.

American ""conservatism"" has fought against all three things, through pushing ""abstinence only education"" which I think is a farce, through opposing birth control, and through supporting regressive taxation policies.

Virtually every conversation I've had in person, between people with differing views on abortion, has reached some sort of consensus that lowering the amount of abortions is a good thing.

2. Why should my taxes be used for others Healthcare when they don't work (I know that this is kinda stupid, like what if someone is a hardworking person but they get bad luck and get hurt on the job and can't afford the bill)
3. When Obama attempted this, Doctors didn't want to join the program because they wouldn't be paid as much
4. Everything would be more inexpensive if states just changed how Healthcare companies can cross state borders and offer business in other states. 
5. Since in Pennsylvania we only have 3 companies they kinda work together and can inflate prices whatever they want and they can do this since a lot of people believe they need Healthcare to live

When the government controls your healthcare they control what treatments you can and can’t have. So if the government doesn’t want to pay for your 60 year old parent to have a cancer treatment they don’t. Private doctors don’t exist because the government “manages” the doctors as well, so you’re locked out of seeking other opinion. 

Two government controlled healthcare inevitably leads to rationing of care, the system becomes bogged down from an influx of people who never took care of themselves. Eventually those who never took care of themselves are denied treatment. The government then usually will enact edicts like “you cant smoke or drink or eat sugary things, because it creates “undue” burden on the system. Again destroys freedom

There's no Obesity epidemic in Denmark. In order for that to work, the government needs to regulate what we put into our bodies as well. Even the Democrats balk at voter initiatives to restrict dieting. Take one look at the fat acceptance movement to prove why this can never happen here.

America isn't just now becoming a bloated country of 350 million people who don't take care of themselves. It's been that way for decades.

Admittedly there is more than likely some overlap between these groups, so lets conservatively say almost one third of out national health expenses are spent in this manner.

Republican,post,Single-payer system,614lsd,cazort2,Are Republicans Doing Anything to decouple healthcare from employment?,"One of the biggest points of disconnect I have with the Democrats' approach to healthcare has been that the ACA strengthened the association between health care and employment.

I personally see the fact that most healthcare is provided through employers, as one of the biggest problems with the U.S. economy.  I see it as causing the following problems:

* A lot of employers are reluctant to hire full-time employees, so they end up hiring lots of part-time employees and having them just under the threshold that would legally make them required to pay benefits.  I think this has the effect of a market intervention...there end up being fewer full-time jobs than there would be under a true free-market system.
* I think it causes a lot of resources to get eaten up when people change plans.  Changing plans is resource intensive, because there is research and paperwork involved in doing it, and sometimes financially costly.   In today's economy, people change employers much more frequently in the past, and I think this cost can be significant.
* It's really hard on self-employed people, and people who piece together an income from multiple part-time jobs. Again, our economy has been shifting more towards this. Also though, some people prefer and/or choose this lifestyle, and I think an ideal setup is one in which they are not treated as second-class citizens.

The ACA required more employers to provide health insurance to their employees.  This really bothers me for multiple reasons.  One, there are plenty of businesses that *cannot afford* to provide health insurance to their employees.  Rising healthcare costs, if borne by the employer, can be a factor driving some companies out of business, and it can also skew the market in favor of outsourcing and/or automation, destroying jobs.

One thing that really bothers me about the Democrats, is that there is this idea that if a business isn't paying health insurance to their employees, it's because they don't want to, and they are exploiting their employees for the profit of the owners, top executives, or shareholders.  As someone who has owned two very small businesses (never employing a full-time employee) and worked closely with numerous ones (most with 2-50 employees), I see how totally out of touch this idea is with the situations many small businesses are actually in.

I think that there could be some huge benefits to decoupling health insurance from employment.  Like, I think one problem right now with the health insurance marketplace under the ACA is that the economics of it were failing because a lot of people were dropping out of it.  But like, if everyone were forced into the same market, I think the economics of it would work better.  Imagine how well such a marketplace would work if *everyone* were forced into the same marketplace.

I don't see much though in the Republican's plan to decouple employment from health insurance.  This frustrates me a lot.

I personally don't have a strong opinion about private insurance vs. single-payer (I think I may actually prefer single-payer, because it also decouples health insurance from employment), but like, whether or not we do single payer, I feel *very strongly* that I want health insurance to be decoupled from employment.

Republican,comment,Single-payer system,dfc33gj,Spektr44,,"I would object to the notion that the ACA strengthened the association between employment and insurance. Depending on your state and health history, getting coverage outside of employer group plans may have been completely non-viable before the ACA. Personal annecdote: I almost moved from NJ to NC in 2008, and one major reason I didn't was due to an inability to get the health insurance I needed on the private market. My wife faced preexisting condition issues, and maternity coverage was not offered at all (we were planning to have multiple children...now we have three). I mean... It's crappy when families are making major life decisions around health insurance. At least today it is possible to get comprehensive coverage without preexisting condition exclusions, although the prices suck if you're above the subsidy threshold.",2017-03-24T02:27:23+00:00

That leaves private insurance.  There are ways to set that up without depending on employers.  But there aren't any ways to do that without Democrats demonizing them for it and convincing the people that Republicans are taking away their health insurance.

I personally support expanding single-payer, but I would strongly prefer it be funded in a different way.  I don't like income tax, but I think a tax on all income would be preferable to a payroll tax because a much lower rate increase would be required to raise a similar amount of revenue.",2017-03-24T13:54:55+00:00
Republican,comment,Single-payer system,dfcvkda,ShelbyvilleManhattan,,"> Republicans aren't going to push single-payer, just look at the VA for all the reasons not to.

If we did single-payer in the US, is there any reason we'd have to do it the way the VA does it? After all, there are plenty of other examples of single-payer systems around the world we could look to for ideas on how to do it: Norway, Japan, UK, Kuwait, Sweden, Bahrain, Brunei, Canada, UAE, Finland, Slovenia, Italy, Portugal, Cyprus, Spain, and Iceland, for example. Norway has over 100 years experience with their system, and about half of those have over 50 years on their systems. That should be plenty of data to let us figure out how to make it work.

There are also a bunch of examples from other countries that are not single-payer that we could look at for some ideas if single-payer is just too unacceptable. Several countries use a two-tier system. In such a system there is government provided or mandated minimum or catastrophic insurance coverage, and than a separate insurance market for additional coverage.

Some countries with two-tier systems: New Zealand, Netherlands, Denmark, France, Australia, Ireland, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Israel. As with the single-payer countries, many of these systems are decades old.

There are also several countries that take the insurance mandate approach, similar in many ways to ACA: Germany, Belgium, Austria, Luxembourg, Greece, South Korea, and Switzerland. Again, many of these have a long history.

Previous floated proposals had the top rate at 33 percent. The administration aims to set the other two tax rates at 25 percent and 10 percent, the latter down from an initial 12 percent proposal.

Simplified tax code... we'll sort of... I don't think that's what I had in mind when someone says they're gonna simplify taxes.  But it still makes me question how we're going to pay for it.

I am a fan of supply-side economics (aka trickle down economics for you leftists out there) but I feel that it has to be incentivized to actually be as effective as we hope. [for instance something like this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3fokbf/what_are_the_alternatives_to_raising_minimum_wage/).  

What I'm curious about is has the lack of appointment of the hundred or so high salary positions really saved the government that much money that these tax cuts and increased military spending (two things I fully endorse) won't result in a deficit increase?

This isn't a corporation that can declare bankruptcy if we over spend.

So my real question (because I've been looking and I suspect it's there but not widely reported) ""how do we plan to pay for these tax cuts in the sort term?""  Long term is clear: increased disposable income, leads to increased income of sales taxes, yada yada yada.  But for the first two years?  How are we paying for it?",2017-04-30T12:02:31+00:00

We’d have to triple our taxes, which are already the highest in the US, to pay for this.

Couple of points to note.  The cost estimate comes from the group proposing this law - a union group - so its likely an underestimation

Additionally, the group funding this law is the nurses union.  They don’t care about solving problems.  They’re just trying to get their work regulated, and their employers taken over by the state, so they can negotiate with the state for higher wages, rather than with private hospital corporations.  

They’re doing this to line their pockets

Biden State Department ‘UNABLE’ to Help U.S. Citizens Escape War-Stricken Ethiopia.
Another foreign policy disaster looms as Americans may be left stranded, again.
by Raheem J. Kassam
 November 6, 2021

In a jarring statement issued this weekend, Joe Biden’s State Department has announced it will not be able to perform the basic functions of evacuating U.S. citizens from the increasingly war-torn country of Ethiopia in Africa. The news will bring recent memories of Americans stranded in Afghanistan back to the minds of the American public.

Months before the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Biden State Department cancelled Trump-era plans to have a Contingency and Crisis Response Bureau, with critics alleging both publicly and privately that the cancellation was simply a partisan effort to stop any Trump-era plans from the beginning of the Biden government.

That behavior costs lives in Afghanistan, and may do so again in Ethiopia, and rebel forces begin moving on the capital Addis Ababa.

As of Saturday morning, official State Department guidance said:

The Department of State urges U.S citizens in Ethiopia to depart now using commercially available options. The U.S. Embassy is unlikely to be able to assist U.S. citizens in Ethiopia with departure if commercial options become unavailable. Although seats on commercial flights currently remain available, we cannot predict when demand will exceed capacity.

Politico reported early Saturday that is has, in fact, been Biden’s lackluster approach to solving the conflict in Ethiopia that created another impending foreign policy mess.

In an article entitled “Biden’s diplomacy push meets its match as Ethiopia unravels,” the left-wing news site admits:

Visa bans. Trade restrictions. Threats of economic sanctions. And visit after visit from top emissaries, including a U.S. senator bearing a message from President Joe Biden.

For a year, U.S. officials have used these and other instruments in their diplomacy toolbox to persuade, push and pressure Ethiopia’s government and rebel forces to end a vicious civil war believed to have killed thousands of people, left hundreds of thousands starving and displaced millions

But nothing is working. And things are getting worse.

Biden even dispatched one of his closest friends, Senator Chris Coons, with a personal letter from Biden urging an end to the conflict. None of the sides involved seemed interested in a letter from the embattled U.S. President.

Ethiopia is one of Africa’s most populous nations and a country which the United States has maintained close diplomatic and trade links with for decades.

Around half a billion dollars in tax payer cash has been ploughed into Ethiopia every year over the past decade in direct assistance alone. You can read more about the background of the war rocking Ethiopia here.

Speaking to The National Pulse in August, President Donald J. Trump said of Biden’s plans to cancel the Contingency and Crisis Bureau designed with evacuating Americans from war-torn nations:

“My Administration prioritized keeping Americans safe, Biden leaves them behind. Canceling this successful Trump Administration program before the withdrawal that would have helped tens of thousands Americans reach home is beyond disgraceful. Our withdrawal was conditions-based and perfect, it would have been flawlessly executed and nobody would have even known we left. The Biden execution and withdrawal is perhaps the greatest embarrassment to our Country in History, both as a military and humanitarian operation.”

There remain an unknown number of U.S. citizens stranded in Afghanistan, to this day.

What I want to stop being covered, or start being covered only with great caution or reservation are (a) unnecessary medications, I want us to especially get more cautious with opiates and other pain meds, excessive meds for the elderly, widely-used psychiatric meds (I believe in using these sparingly and I think their benefits are overstated and risks understated), cholesterol lowering meds (I think these are a scam based on pseudoscience and possibly harm and kill significant numbers of people) (b) surgery when PT alone could suffice which I am convinced (c) any costly treatment when there is any lifestyle treatment that would suffice. (d) unnecessary medical tests especially in cases where a cheaper test could tell if a more expensive test is necessary.

I'd also like to ban all advertising for things like hospitals, drugs, etc. as I think that fuels hypochondria and over-use of the system, not to mention it being a cost in and of itself that is indirectly paid contributing to rising health care costs.

Suppose I don't buy insurance. I can live for years without insurance. Then one day the doctor says that I have cancer. I then buy insurance. The insurance company can't deny me because the law says that they must insure me with pre-existing conditions. So I buy insurance, make the insurance company pay for my treatment. Then when I am well, I stop buying insurance. In that scenario insurance companies will not last because people will only buy insurance when they are sick. 

The reason for denying people with pre-existing conditions is because it forces people to by insurance when they are well. Obamacare tried to solve this problem by forcing people to buy insurance.

Republican,comment,Pre-existing conditions,dh1rhua,Douglas-MacArthur,,"I guess it depends on how you view the place of health insurance in general. On the one hand, I believe in most situations that companies, including health insurance providers, you have policies determined by free market competition. Your competitor has less coverage for pre-existing conditions? Offer full coverage and get more customers.

However, health insurance is weird in a couple of ways that make such provisions arising from the free market difficult, in addition to the fact that even pre-Obamacare was not entirely free market. I think there needs to be two solutions combined into one: 1) Make insurance through employers taxable or remove it altogether, allowing a free market between insurance buyers and allowing people to have continuous coverage between jobs, 2) allow those with pre-existing conditions a one time pass to gain coverage.

This, I think, fixes the issue and helps those outside of the fix before it happened. The biggest issue is that while people with pre-existing conditions may need coverage, it makes almost no sense for an insurance company to take them on- the insurance companies mostly make money when you pay for it but don't need it and these people guarantee that they will need it. I think there still could be money to be made there, which is why a free market solution would help, but at the end of the day, diabetes or cancer or any other long-term illness *does* cost more for someone, so at some point that cost has to be paid.

If going to the hospital when you are sick to get checked out cost you $20 and your GP cost you $10 it would incentivise you to go to the GP where the cost of treatment is in orders of magnitude lower than at a hospital.

Health INSURANCE is different than health CARE. We can have good modern health care in America while preserving the meaning of the word insurance. Can you imagine if car insurance had to cover pre-existing conditions?

You might ask why anyone would pay for health insurance if they can just use the welfare program to cover any unexpected illnesses... there are a lot of ways around that.

I say that if you are a free market purist there either needs to be a free market solution or you have to be okay with those people simply needing to struggle to get coverage/healthcare in some cases. If you aren't a purist then you have to be okay with taking that cost out of other peoples pockets, either to cover what the insurance companies are forced to pay extra or more directly through taxes.

My wife and I have not booked a cruise because we both had COVID and have antibodies and T-cells. Taking a vaccine would be both superfluous and potentially dangerous. Since the purpose of requiring a vaccine is to hopefully ensure guests have antibodies to COVID, why isn’t a test showing the existence of antibodies sufficient, rather than proof of a vaccination? 

As a point of reference, we have traveled to the USVIs twice this year. In order to do so, the health department for the USVIs requires proof of the antibodies and the test has to be performed no more than four months prior to travel. 

By ignoring immunity acquired as a result of having recovered from the virus, the administration is creating unnecessary economic and social problems. 

I pray they make a policy shift to acknowledge the existence of natural immunity acquired by recovering from the virus. The PR around such a change would make sense to all. And, I look forward to taking a cruise to celebrate.",2021-08-10T13:01:27+00:00

I can deal with the monthly increase, the pain comes from the fact that my massive premiums don't pay for **anything**.

I'm healthy.  I'm middle aged.  I don't need a lot of healthcare.  But what little I do need isn't covered **at all** because my deductible is $7,500 per year.

That's been the biggest disaster of the ACA.  My insurance is effectively worthless, because I never reach my absurd deductible.

Sure, if I get cancer and need a million dollars in healthcare, I'll be glad I have it.  But in the almost 15 years since the ACA was implemented, I've never once reached my deductible.  It's insane that I pay all this money and get practically zero benefit from it.

Before the ACA, my insurance covered me whenever I needed an unexpected few stitches or a prescription for amoxicillin.  Now, I seriously consider whether I want to go get something checked out because I know that it will be a bill in the mail.  And I make **good** money.  It's asinine.

A few years ago, I slipped on ice on my front porch.  Split my forehead open.  Hospital insisted on a CT to make sure I hadn't cracked my skull... totally reasonable.  2 Grand for the CT, 500 for the stitches, and a few hundred more for.. random stuff.  Every cent out of pocket.

Conservative,comment,Affordable Care Act,k2pvpf9,killjoygrr,,"Health care costs are absolutely insane. 

The health insurance companies themselves just add on massive costs. 

I would love to see a deep dive as to why the costs have been going up so rapidly since 2000 given only half that time was under the ACA. 

All of that being said…

The ACA did do one thing that did increase costs. And that was keeping insurance companies from keeping out unhealthy people. Part of why insurance was cheaper in the past, was that they could outright deny insurance to anyone they saw as unhealthy. Further, for people who were really sick (think cancer and other very expensive ailments), once you cost a certain amount OVER YOUR ENTIRE LIFE, they dropped you. So if you were really, really sick for a year or a couple of years (the people most in need of insurance) you were cut loose and could not get insurance again. 

Was it a bad thing to keep insurance companies from excluding sick people, or drop them after they spent a certain amount of them?",2023-09-29T13:09:07+00:00

Intellectual property law reform.   IP laws are what let big pharma keep charging $3k/mo for a drug that some university developed 3 decades ago, but they ever so slightly change it so they can keep their corner of the market locked up.

Tort reform.   A significant aspect of health care cost come from ""Covering your ass"".   CYA leads to unnecessary tests (just in case), getting hundreds of sign offs, and high admin overhead to track all the CYA.   It also should be reformed in the other direction... Corporate Execs that knowingly cheat the system, bribe, hide or otherwise lie to get FDA approvals, marketing, etc, should face personal consequences and not be shielded by corporate entities.

EMS System abuse.   This ties in with tort reform.   Because of liability concerns, you call 911 at 3am for toe pain you have had for a week, you get transported by ambulance (at the cost of several thousand dollars.) and if you can't pay the hospitals and EMS providers build those losses into their other healthcare costs.

As far as practical policy outcomes are concerned, I'd support a Teddy Roosevelt-type to do some ""trust-busting"". I'd also support further government regulation that sets price caps on medical procedures and supplies. We've all seen the memes about [$10 cough drops](https://imgur.com/Rkgvmev); it's become very clear that medical providers and insurers are abusing the combination of mandatory insurance coverage and opaque pricing (masked by insurance copays) for which they have successfully lobbied.

My wife and I saw this firsthand this year when she delivered our most recent child. Our hospital disclosed that a delivery would cost approximately *$7k without insurance, and $18k with insurance -* ***more than double the cost that we would pay in cash***! Since $7k was more than our annual deductible, we opted for the insured option, and the hospital made more than $10k in extra profit off of our delivery...

I'm all for a free market, and it's important to note that the medical industry doesn't resemble one in any way, shape or form.

> Californians, as individuals, employers, and taxpayers, have experienced a rise in the cost of health care and health care coverage in recent years, including **rising premiums, deductibles, and copays**, as well as restricted provider networks and high out-of-network charges.

In Part I, the bill delves into how the ACA has helped citizens, then goes into Part II and obliterates any feasible argument for the bill's economics. The solution is to get the government out of healthcare, not continually double down onto failed policy.",2017-06-25T18:18:10+00:00

Conservative,comment,Universal healthcare,djdy4rs,HopeThatHalps,,">“Even senators who voted for Senate Bill 562 noted there are potentially fatal flaws in the bill, including the fact it does not address many serious issues, such as financing, delivery of care, cost controls, or the realities of needed action by the Trump administration and voters to make SB 562 a genuine piece of legislation,” Rendon said.

>Democratic Sens. Ricardo Lara and Toni Atkins, who introduced the proposal, acknowledged the bill was dead for the year. Lara and Atkins had described the bill as a work in progress when it passed the Senate earlier this month without a funding plan. A legislative analysis pegged the cost at $400 billion.

>The abrupt announcement shields members of the Assembly from having to take a difficult vote that could be used against them by critics or supporters of the policy.

So TL;DR, it was an incomplete bill that they put up for a vote early in an attempt to get politicians on record as having voted down a single payer system. ",2017-06-25T18:57:45+00:00

Conservative,comment,Deductibles,dp8s72x,personAAA,,"Hey /r/politics check these ideas out: 

• Businesses would lose the ability to deduct certain executive compensation above $1 million, which they can now do for performance-based pay.

• Tax-exempt bonds could no longer be used to build professional sports stadiums.

• Sets a top 25% rate for pass-through businesses such as S corporations and partnerships. The plan includes complicated guardrails that limit people from turning what would otherwise be wage income taxed at up to 39.6% into business income taxed at a lower rate.

• New limits on corporate interest deductions, which would be capped at 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which is a measure of cash flow. Real-estate firms and small businesses would be exempt from that limit.

• Creates a new one-time tax on overseas profits set at 12% for cash holdings and 5% for illiquid holdings, a provision meant to force companies to repatriate overseas profits. Creates a new 10% tax on U.S. companies’ high-profit foreign subsidiaries, calculated on a global basis, but active overseas profits wouldn’t otherwise be taxed.

>Home Sale Benefit Pared Back In GOP Tax Plan
The House Republican tax plan would claw back a benefit for high-income homeowners: The ability to declare that most profits from home sales aren’t taxable capital gains.

>The proposal retains the current exclusion—$500,000 for married filers and $250,000 for others. But unlike current law, the benefit would phase out for high-income taxpayers, getting reduced once adjusted gross income hits $500,000 for married couples and $250,000 for others.

>The proposal also brings back an older rule for claiming the benefit. To get the exclusion, taxpayers must have used the home as their principal residence for five out of the previous eight years. Current law requires the taxpayer to have lived there for two of the previous five years. - Richard Rubin

Conservative,comment,Deductibles,dp8t7q4,tivw,,"I have mixed feelings

* 401K not affected - good

* Mortgage deduction - $500K seems a bit low given the price of homes in big cities. $750K would be a good compromise

* State/Property Tax deductions - Good. I never understood why this is ok. Theoretically a state could raise their taxes so high that their population contributes nothing to the federal government. If you want to raise taxes and spending in your state, do it - don't ask the federal government to subsidize you. Removing this makes sense.

* Corporate tax rate down to 20% - Good change. US Corporate tax is abnormally high in the developed world. However, I have yet to see anything being done about all the deductions and other credits which bring Corporate taxes down even more. 20% is a good number, provided it's *actually* the number.

* Elimination of Estate (Death) Tax - While a unpopular opinion, I like the death tax *provided that* it is set high enough. People should have to contribute to their country to be wealthy. If they simply inherit more wealth than they can possible spend, then they engage in rent-seeking  behaviors, and they don't build anything. I'd be ok raising the exemption to $10 Million, but I don't think repealing outright is good.

* Removing the Alternative Minimum Tax - Not happy this is being removed. There are too many ways to game the tax system to avoid paying taxes, especially when you're incredibly rich. I have no issue lowering the taxes on the rich if they actually pay their taxes. If this removal is coupled with eliminating loopholes, I'm for it.

* Increases to Child Benefits - I'm all for this. They should be bigger. The US population is in decline, and only immigration is keeping it afloat. Anything the government can do to incentive people to have families (ie more families with children, not more children per family), the better.

Last, the big elephant in the room here is the lack of any discussion of spending cuts, or deficit reduction. I remember the GOP in congress shutting down the government (causing a credit downgrade!) because they refused to allow the deficit to keep growing. Now they seem perfectly ok with a massive deficit - and while I agree that lower taxes stimulates growth, it is *not* revenue neutral. This is passing a huge burden on to future generations, and the complete lack of acknowledgement by the GOP really has me troubled. It's still early in the process, so I am giving the the benefit of the doubt for now.

All of that being said, I have some concerns about the decrease in revenue not being offset by a decline in spending.  This seems likely to drive the deficit up further.  We will get a partial offset from growth but I don't think it will be enough to match it.

> California was the first U.S. state to specify the use of chemical castration for repeat child molesters as a condition of their parole, following the passage of a modification to Section 645 of the California penal code in 1996. This law stipulates castration for anyone convicted of child molestation with a minor under 13 years of age if they are on parole after their second offense. Offenders may not reject the intervention.

> When used on males, these drugs can reduce sex drive, sexual fantasies, and capacity for sexual arousal. Life-threatening side effects are rare, but some users show increases in body fat and reduced bone density, which increase long-term risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, respectively. Males may also experience gynecomastia (development of larger-than-normal mammary glands in males); full development is less common unless chemical castration is combined with feminizing oestrogen therapy.

> When used on females, the effects are similar, though there is little research about chemically lowering female's sex drive or female-specific anaphrodisiacs, since most research focuses on the opposite, but anti-androgenic hormone regimens would lower testosterone in females which can impact sex drive or sexual response. These drugs also deflate the breast glands and expand the size of the nipple. Also seen is a sudden shrinking in bone mass and discoloration of the lips, reduced body hair, and muscle mass.

So gender affirming doctors are giving these to children to treat no medical condition, just because a pre-teen decides they are hesitant about puberty or a parent wants an lgbt child. 

Imagine a scenario where an awkward young boy who thought he wants to be a girl is embarrassed that he started getting boners when he sees a cute girl and a gender affirming doctor says ""we can fix that for you.""",2022-06-11T14:06:03+00:00

Conservative,comment,Medicare,j7okyty,Flowers1966,,"Watched the speech and took notes. Wanted to post my assessments but I am ancient and don’t know how to post.  According to my notes there were over 19 times where Biden lied. 

To be fair, Biden gave o good and inclusive introduction. He followed this by giving himself the credit for job growth. Job growth  is what should be expected after the Covid shutdowns. Then he spoke for democracy. This is what most Americans want but the Biden lack of transparency hurts democracy. He then states that he doesn’t support conflict for the sake of conflict which is a lie -he has used this false abuse of conflict to gain power. He then speaks of his father’ s dignity and respect while ignoring the harm and disrespect that he shows his own granddaughter by not including or recognizing her. 

He then acknowledges supply chain and energy chain failures but blames them on false causes and does not blame them on his policies. He goes on to acknowledge inflation but spouts wage increases. Wage increases have not kept up with inflation. He next blamed supply problems on things other than his culpability. 
Biden then spoke about investing in America, but did not take credit for harming our energy sources by his policies. He then went to the emotional card-cancer and diabetes. (This is something personal to me-my husband has a slow growing stage four cancer and one of my children has type one diabetes-my son is not overweight, exercises, and eats a healthy diet. I often wonder since type one diabetes is not common in our family, if it may have been caused by the drugs he was given as a child.). Senile Joe suggested a plan to cut costs by making drug companies bite the cost. This sounds good but will it also cause the drug companies to slow experimentation?  Then he spoke of the affordable care act. This is something that sounds good but is a recipe for disaster if one looks at practicality. 

He then spoke of climate change and forest fires. Here his ignorance shined brightly. He then spoke of energy efficient appliances. Few object to energy efficient appliances, but we just aren’t there yet in both efficiency and cost.

We also all know the frustration of dealing with insurance; from making sure a doctor takes our kind of insurance, to arguing with the company about what treatment they'll cover, to getting that surprise $5k bill because a consultant for your surgery was out of network. 

We are paying for-profit companies, with their billions and their millionaire executives, to *deny us healthcare*. Their goal is to make lots of money or it would be a shitty business. Are they looking out for the best interests of patients or their shareholders?

Why shouldn't we shave off the multi-million dollar salaries and stock profits to redirect money towards actual care? Remove the current burdens on employers to pay for insurance? Actually encourage people to go to the doctor/dentist regularly and be healthy, rather than avoid them at all costs until it's really serious?

>and obese 

In the US there are 106.4 million people that are overweight, at an additional lifetime healthcare cost of $3,770 per person average. 98.2 million obese at an average additional lifetime cost of $17,795. 25.2 million morbidly obese, at an average additional lifetime cost of $22,619. With average lifetime healthcare costs of $879,125, obesity accounts for 0.99% of our total healthcare costs. 

https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1038/oby.2008.290

We're spending 165% more than the OECD average on healthcare--that works out to over half a million dollars per person more over a lifetime of care--and you're worried about 0.99%?

Here's another study, that actually found that lifetime healthcare for the obese are *lower* than for the healthy. 

>Although effective obesity prevention leads to a decrease in costs of obesity-related diseases, this decrease is offset by cost increases due to diseases unrelated to obesity in life-years gained. Obesity prevention may be an important and cost-effective way of improving public health, but it is not a cure for increasing health expenditures...In this study we have shown that, although obese people induce high medical costs during their lives, their lifetime health-care costs are lower than those of healthy-living people but higher than those of smokers. Obesity increases the risk of diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart disease, thereby increasing health-care utilization but decreasing life expectancy. Successful prevention of obesity, in turn, increases life expectancy. Unfortunately, these life-years gained are not lived in full health and come at a price: people suffer from other diseases, which increases health-care costs. Obesity prevention, just like smoking prevention, will not stem the tide of increasing health-care expenditures.

https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/46007081/Lifetime_Medical_Costs_of_Obesity.PDF

For further confirmation we can look to the fact that healthcare utilization rates in the US are similar to its peers. 

https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/salinas/HealthCareDocuments/4.%20Health%20Care%20Spending%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Other%20High-Income%20Countries%20JAMA%202018.pdf

One final way we can look at it is to see if there is correlation between obesity rates and increased spending levels between various countries. There isn't.

If you are a shitty driver and get in accidents every other week, car insurance companies can refuse to cover you, or charge you astronomical rates. They can also charge you extra just because you're a man and according to their actuarial tables, you are higher risk of getting in an accident.

ACA prevents insurance companies from doing this and in this metaphor, people are really shitty at maintaining their cars even with free checkups.

So because they can't charge more for pre-existing conditions (and because people are not taking care of their health especially weight-related health), it's causing the burden on the medical system to go up significantly which raises the cost for everyone.

endorsed by the World Health Organization has found that the risks of mRNA Covid-19 vaccination heavily outweigh the benefits, with scientists discovering a person is on average 339% more likely to suffer a serious adverse event such as cardiac arrest, stroke, or death due to the Pfizer Covid-19 injection than they are to be hospitalised with Covid-19.

 The World Health Organization’s Global Advisory Committee both endorsed and recommended the reporting of AESIs based on this priority list. (List of all the possible Adverse Events within link below)

""Scientists discovered that in the Moderna trial, the excess risk of serious AESIs (15.1 per 10,000 participants) greatly surpassed the risk reduction for COVID-19 hospitalization relative to the placebo group (6.4 per 10,000 participants). This means recipients of the Modern injection were and are 140% more likely to suffer a serious adverse event than they are to be hospitalised with Covid-19.""

>Dr. Peter McCullough:	The doctors appear to be like many of our leaders. By the way, all the leaders of the major churches, every single one of them, the major religious branches, are under the spell. Every major global international leader is under the spell. We’re in what’s called a mass formation psychosis. This is very important.

>Dr. Peter McCullough:	I give credit to Dr. Mattias Desmet in the University again in Belgium. And recently, Dr. Mark McDonald, psychiatrist from L.A. Mark McDonald’s, got a new book out the United States of Fear, describing how the mass psychosis developed. What your listeners need to know is a mass psychosis is when there is a groupthink that develops that’s so strong that it leads to something horrific. And the examples are these mass suicides that occur in these religious cults.

>Dr. Peter McCullough:	The example is Nazi Germany. When people walk into gas Chambers and we guess these horrific things in four elements here. It’s very important, Joe. First, there must be a period of prolonged isolation. Lockdowns. Number two, there must be a withdrawal of things taken away from people that they used to enjoy. That’s happened.

>Dr. Peter McCullough:	Number three, there must be constant, incessant, free floating anxiety, all this new cycle, all the deaths and the hospitalizations, more variant mutant strains, everything, people becoming scared over and over again. The last thing, number four, the capper is there must be a single solution offered by an entity in authority, and in this case, is clear. Worldwide. The solution was vaccination. Everybody must take the vaccination.

In short, what we are seeing here is a deliberate attempt to create a mass psychosis and exploit that for political gain. Take a look at the 4 steps and ask yourself if that is what we are seeing here with this all out full court press by the media and the Biden administration.",2022-01-06T11:58:10+00:00

What it does say is that rapid antigen tests give false negative outcomes for the first two days after infection. The PCR tests do respond more rapidly to infection, but are harder to administer and take longer to complete. So, *some* tests do detect in all cases where someone is infectious, and the rapid antigen ones that don't still have some value so that folks can let folks they've been around for the two days prior to the test that they've been possibly exposed and they can behave accordingly. Or, one can isolate for 2 days prior to a test, then have a reasonably high likelihood that they're not contagious if they test negative, which might be useful if they're visiting someone who's vulnerable to COVID. 

The tests have limits, they're not a magic solution to this. But they're not useless either. 

Oh, and yeah, notice how we didn't even have rapid antigen testing from anything other than shady gray market Chinese import sites for a full year and a half of the pandemic? Blame the FDA for that.

Here's the abstract for people that don't want to download the PDF:

>**Abstract**

>National surveys conducted in 2010 and 2012 suggest the following conclusions:

>1. American understanding of what is and is not in the ACA has been far from perfect.

>2. Correct understanding of the elements of the bill we examined varied with party identification: Democrats understood the most, independents less, and Republicans still less.

>3. Older people and more educated people have understood the elements of the bill we examined better than have younger and less educated people.

>4. Between 2010 and 2012, public understanding of the elements of the bill we examined did not change notably.

>5. Most people have favored most of the elements of the ACA that we examined , but not everyone recognized that these elements were all in the plan.

>6. Most people opposed policies that were sometimes falsely thought to be parts of the ACA.

>7. If the public had perfect understanding of the elements that we examined, the proportion of Americans who favor the bill might increase from the current level of 32% to 70%.

>Taken together, all this suggests that if education efforts were to correct public misunderstanding of the bill, public favorability might increase considerably.",2013-10-03T19:17:07+00:00

Regarding the second point, ignoring the legality of it, we are paying it anyway. You really have no choice, as in a modern society, we cannot just let people die. Well, we can and do, but we shouldnt and try not to. So what you get is people going to emergency rooms ONLY when theyre sick and existing on ambulatory care, rather than preventive medicine. They go in, get treated for only what the immediate issue is and then go home, still needing care, but they dont get it. Furthermore, since they cant afford insurance, its likely they cannot afford $5-10,000 in ER bills, so the hospitals write that off. They charge normal customers more and they take that as a loss on their taxes. Because they are paying less in taxes, other tax payers pick up the differnece. We also pay more in insurance premiums to cover the people cant or wont pay. So you and I are paying twice to support the one person who would be covered if we just paid incrimentally more in taxes, yet significantly less overall. This even goes above the main benefit of helping our fellow man. 

A buddy of mine said ""Well, people will just take advantage of that! They dont need free healthcare that I work for!"" My response was ""What difference does it make?! Its literally cheaper for all of us who work to provide for those people. Plus, if theyre covreded, they can get the help they need so they arent missing work and we are putting people back in the workforce, by making them able to work again, thereby strenghening our economy. 

AT THE VERY LEAST, we are helping to make sure 15-20million people do not die due to lack of insurance. Look at all the outrage over 9/11 where 3,000 Americans died. 15-20 MILLION could die without access to healthcare and people dont seem to care. Blows my mind... ",2017-06-13T19:28:52+00:00

From the link below

http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/opinion/law-in-the-raw.html

>Congress assumed that most states would set up exchanges; most states, led by red-state governors, did not. Section 1321 of the law provides that when a state defaults, the secretary of health and human services shall “establish and operate such Exchange within the State.” Clear enough: “such Exchange” implies, without explicitly saying so, that the federal exchange stands in for the missing state’s exchange and assumes its functions. But another section, 1401, explicitly makes the tax subsidies available to taxpayers and their dependents who buy insurance “through an Exchange established by the State.” Those challenging the law say this means “only the state” and that the I.R.S. is not authorized to give subsidies to the more than five million people enrolled through federally run exchanges.

Since many states didn't set up exchanges, the fed stepped in and did it for the ones that didn't set up exchanges. Subsidies for the people on these federal exchanges could be struck down.


>These two provisions, part of a 900-page statute that was cobbled together without going through the usual House-Senate conference committee in which it might have been cleaned up, are the source of the confusion. 


This really bothered me when they skipped conference committee when passing the house and senate versions of the ACA because the changes that would have been made would never have passed a re-vote, which is the normal way things get done on capital hill. I find it interesting that political gamesmanship is what could actually bring down the ACA. Live by the sword die by the sword!

If you spend 1/2 your life going to school and becoming the top brain surgeon in the world, why the heck should some bureaucrat sitting in an office somewhere who dropped out of medical school decide how much you can make?  

Here is how you really bring down prices. You provide universal “catastrophic” insurance.  Get into a major accident, get cancer and you are covered. For the day to day stuff you get a set amount of tax credit. You negotiate with your doctor the price of things and watch prices drop.  Example laser eye surgery which insurance does NOT cover went from $10-15k when it first came on the market to less than $3k now on average.  Say we give everyone a $5,000.00 credit, what you don’t use you can either roll over to next year or reduce it for your taxes.  When you die any money can pass to your heirs for their medical care.

Friend of mine needed and MRI for back pain.  With Insurance his out of pocket was $6k (had not met deductible for the year).  Went to another location they asked $1,500.00 paying himself no insurance.  Went to a third location $500.00!

>I'm not for interrupting free business

I'm not sure what definition of ""interrupt"" you're using, but regulating what revenues a business can make is very much interrupting that business. All decisions are made based on revenue, so when you regulate revenue, you are interrupting every single decision a business makes.

>There should be some kind of protection for healthcare that doesn't destroy a person's income for a lifetime.

Here I do agree with you. I just wish there were some sort of service available where you could pay them smaller amounts every month, but if you do get hurt, they would agree to pay the big bill. If only something like that existed.

>I'd happily go to a veterinarian for some.procedures to save money if they would allow it.

Yeah that's because the government interferes with the free market to tell people what they can and can't do about their own medical decisions. 

If you regulated that I could only sell my hot dogs for $2 because it's life-sustaining and my prices are too expensive, than I'm just going to quit selling hot dogs entirely. If I can't make money at it I'm not going to do it. How does that help people? Pharmaceutical companies spend billions of dollars trying to develop new drugs every year, and if they get one through the FDA, they can make that money back and more. If you tell them that their profits will be capped, they would stop bother inventing new drugs. Price caps would kill those incentives.

conservatives,post,Single-payer system,26q4oy,IBiteYou,Results of stickied thread: Posters' conclusions as to how the Republicans can beat the Democrats,"First, the post got stickied because people decided to start downvoting it.  That alone might be telling of some of the people in the subreddit, but once we stickied it...it couldn't be ignored.  Here are some of the suggestions on that thread.

 - Quit paying attention to ""phony scandals"".  (All of the scandals are ""phony"".)

 - Focus on ""leading"".  (Even though we are the minority party right now.)

 - Appeal to people in the middle.

 - Drop ""extreme views.""  (Be like John Huntsman.)

 - Become ""sane.""

 - Do not consider corporate interests.  It gives a bad appearance.

 - Don't talk about God.

 - Don't talk about abortion.  It is not an issue.

 - Don't talk about rape.  (Of course, if we don't talk about abortion, this won't happen...since it was mostly discussed in terms of when an abortion is acceptable.)
 
 - Don't pay attention to the news and get outraged about things.

 - Stop watching Fox news.

 - Stop consuming ANY conservative news source.

 - Stop opposing the Democrats on things.  You seem ""contrarian.""

 - Focus on the budget.  Be open to compromise on it.

 - Give up on repealing Obamacare.  Work on making it better.  It's the law.

 - Stop talking about war when it's not needed.

 - Get behind campaign finance reform.

 - Lead by example.
 
 - Tell the truth.

 - Don't talk about problems with Common Core.

 - Denounce politicians who say outrageous things.

 - Budget cuts are bad.

 - Global warming skepticism is unacceptable.

 - Drop opposition to gay marriage.

 - Do not talk about Muslim terrorism.

 - Support a single-payer universal healthcare system.

 - Give more money to the VA because that's the only reason they have a problem.

 - Promote the idea of green jobs and education jobs and tech jobs because that will solve the unemployment crisis.

 - End the war on drugs.  Decriminalize all drugs. 

 - Oppose the death penalty.

 - Get behind legalizing pot.

It is also interesting to note that conservatives who commented on the thread in response to some of the suggestions appear to have been downvoted...on their own subreddit.

Some of these are reasonable and are, sort of, already being done as conservatives have become more liberal overall... but if you take the whole of the suggestions, it appears that some among us really insist that we COMPLETELY transform into an entity that doesn't stand for anything conservative AT ALL in order to be acceptable.

So.. on next Saturday, we are going to just go ahead and change the subreddit name to /r/DemocratII in order to reflect the views of those who are showing up here.

Thanks for your time.

p.s. We are not really going to change the name.  Just wanted to give everyone an idea of the folks that have been showing up lately, and what they believe in.  A few of the comments were good, but overall, no surprise... liberals would like it better if we ignored everything conservative and went ahead and became democrat lite.

conservatives,post,Medicaid,bxo57w,cmgww,Medical bills/Medicaid rant. Something needs to change.,"So my wife just gave birth to our 3rd son a little over two weeks ago. It wasn’t planned, as our first two were with the help of fertility treatments and we were told having them on our own is nearly impossible. Well we were blessed to have a 3rd, even if unplanned. 
Then, two days after he was born he began to show signs of having major issues feeding (turning blue when breastfeeding, a strider or rattling in his throat) and the docs wanted him to go to the NICU at the hospital. He has been there since, including today. 

What burns me is this. I have always worked hard, all of my career. I make over $100k a year and we don’t live beyond our means. I recently started a new job with just ok insurance (for a multinational, multibillion  dollar corporation). In fact they use the freaking ACA marketplace! So I chose a plan that kept more in my wallet and just saved for the out of pocket for the birth of my son (not counting on the medical issues). Now he has had tons of expensive tests, and the bills are starting to come (and we’re not even out of the hospital yet). Thankfully he’s not in critical condition.
The real kicker is this. Every day I’m up in the NICU, and I see what clearly are Medicaid moms/dads (sometimes dads). Nails done, brand new iPhones, bitching about this or that....and I know they’re getting the same high quality care I’m getting for basically free. That’s fucked up. My taxes fund this in part. I’m in Indiana so we’re pretty conservative (which I’m usually fine with), but I feel like we’re the ones getting screwed over. Not rich enough for this not to matter, but not poor enough to milk the system and have 5 kids to get more welfare money. So when it’s all said and done we’ll have about a $10,000 medical bill AFTER INSURANCE. Meanwhile the CEOs of Anthem, Cigna, etc keep getting huge bonuses. And the hospital executives too...let’s not forget them. 

TL:DR
Our healthcare system is broken IMO. The answer is not “universal healthcare” or a one payer system. I’m not that dumb. But what can be done so that families like mine don’t wind up with huge ass medical bills?? The families in the middle class/upper middle class??",2019-06-07T00:26:31+00:00

BY CATHERINE SALGADO

A summer accounting program sponsored by a number of major New York universities and designed for high school students does not permit white students to apply.
The program, “Career Opportunities in the Accounting Profession,” is sponsored by the Moynihan Scholarship Fund and the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants, as well as nine leading New York universities, including five public universities. The course intends to introduce to the accounting profession 250 “promising underrepresented high school students.”

“In addition to virtual sessions about forensic accounting, interviewing skills, public speaking, networking, and an ‘accounting profession overview’ featuring a panel discussion with experts in the profession.

Nine institutions of higher education in New York — including Ithaca College, Medgar Evers College, Rochester Institute of Technology, St. John’s University, Siena College, SUNY New Paltz, SUNY Oswego, the University at Buffalo, and Westchester Community College — are listed as hosts for the program, which is free of charge for students. . .

Five of the nine schools participating in the program — including Medgar Evers College, SUNY New Paltz, SUNY Oswego, the University at Buffalo, and Westchester Community College — are public universities funded by New York state.”

On the application form for the program, however, applicants are supposed to choose a “race” or ethnicity option with which they identify.  Hispanic, Black, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and Native American are among the options on the application form.  “White,” however, is not even an option.

A father whose son, a high school junior, is interested in business anonymously expressed his “frustration” over the racial prejudice of the program to Campus Reform.  The father was upset that his “child can’t apply because he’s white.”

Campus Reform reached out to the universities sponsoring the accounting program and received a response from SUNY Oswego’s Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Scott Furlong that indicated Furlong agrees that the program may be unfair.

“SUNY Oswego participates in supporting the program and sees this as a beneficial service to the profession, but we strongly believe that all disadvantaged students would benefit from the COAP program,” Furlong stated. “While we do not participate in recruiting the student participants in COAP or in the setting of policy for student membership, SUNY Oswego would prefer a more inclusive perspective regarding membership in COAP and the NYSSCPA policy.”

While saying that the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants is responsible for setting the policies that only allow “students of color” to apply, Furlong added that the program’s exclusion of white students “merits much future discussion for the purposes of having SUNY Oswego reassess our involvement and reconsider our sponsorship.”

conservatives,comment,Pre-existing conditions,dh65jqx,HemoKhan,,"Regarding your safeguards:

1) Continuous coverage is contingent on continuous employment, which is disigenuous - the time a person likely needs the *most* help paying for their medical bills is when they're out of work.

2) Do you know many people who have lost their job and *only* been out of work for a couple months? The average time people are out of work these days is 3-6 months - so most of those people will lose their continuous coverage protection, if they're relying on employee insurance. And while the continuous coverage protections seem to ensure that people can't be denied, they don't seem to do much to restrict costs (and again, that means individuals could face the ""choice"" of impossible premiums or no coverage at all). 

3) This is true, and these will help somewhat - but depending on your age and income, you will likely not see much change between the current tax credits you're receiving under Obamacare and the new credit you'd see under the AHCA. The AHCA credits are skewed towards younger, more successful individuals while the Obamacare credits were skewed towards older, poorer folks.

4) High-risk pools are certainly better than nothing - but they existed before Obamacare as well, and while they did work to some extent, they were also hideously expensive. I personally was in a high-risk pool in NY before Obamacare was passed, and was paying literally 90% of my monthly income towards premiums. The premium tax credits will (if applicable) help here, but again remember that those who are making the least are also getting less help under the new AHCA plan.

5) Medicaid is being block-granted and the expansion to medicaid under Obamacare is being halted. It's possible (though uncertain) that states getting set amounts of funding per person (as it's set up in the AHCA) will prioritize healthier individuals over sicker ones when considering applications to Medicaid.

There *are* safeguards in place, but they are not *that* safe. The sky isn't falling, like some liberals are claiming, but it's a huge step down in confidence from the protections currently in place. ",2017-05-05T15:59:30+00:00
conservatives,comment,Pre-existing conditions,dh69dlg,hillrat,,"1. Section 133 of the AHCA extends similar HIPAA protections for guaranteed issue to the individual market. As long as the person maintains coverage and doesn't have a 63 day gap or more, the insurer cannot charge the 30% mark up on premiums. If the state gets a waiver, the state may change the fee from a flat 30% mark up to a health status rating instead.

2. As I mentioned in point 1, there is guaranteed protections for people. So even if a person is out of work for 60 days, then decides to take the tax credit offered by the government to purchase insurance, they are still protected from either the 30% surcharge on premiums or the potential health status rating mark up in a waiver state.

3. I'm glad we both agree that the tax credits will help people on the individual market.

4. High risk pools varied by state so effectiveness could vary between New York and Alaska or wherever. [According to a GAO report from 2009 on high risk pools](http://www.gao.gov/assets/100/96314.pdf) premiums could vary from $500-$800 before subsidies. Look at the ACA markets right now and you'll see similar premiums. The difference is that in the ACA marketplace, those high premiums are seeping out to the rest of the individual market.

5. Medicaid should be a state responsibility. If you're a Texan and you want to prioritize one population over another, fine. Michigan should be afforded the same choice. What's more, those state law makers are closer to their constituents so they can get a good read on how people want to take care of the less fortunate in their state.

I agree it's not a perfect solution, but I like this bill better than obamacare.",2017-05-05T17:10:50+00:00

According to [this](http://www.valuepenguin.com/ppaca/exchanges/ga) there are tons of plans far less than that. For example, if they were a 40 year old smoker and earning $50,000 then a Bronze plan costs $236/month. Even a Platinum plan for that person would be $361/month.

conservatives,comment,Health insurance marketplace,cd77nxw,soulcaptain,,"Plans are being replaced, and yes, some of them are more expensive.  But if you have to pay more for a new plan, understand something important: your previous plan was very very likely a piece of shit plan.  If you had anything catastrophic or needed chronic care, your (soon to be) old plan *would NOT have covered that*.  The ACA fixes this.  Of course, being a counterfactual this is impossible to prove unless something happened to you, and if you are complaining about the rate increase then it's a sign you haven't had to deal.  In other words, your insurance plan was like a glass house and you thought it was reinforced steel.  The ACA gives you a real reinforced steel plan...or at least one better than glass.

AND note that these are private insurance companies raising rates; it really has nothing to do with the federal government.  Health insurance companies *always* raise rates; that's how they make shareholders happy.

Also, this rate change/increase affects a quite small percentage of people, something like 4% or 5%.  Not trivial, I know, but we need to keep things in perspective.

The truth is the ACA is so beneficial in so many ways, all this will be a hiccup in a few years time.

conservatives,post,unnecessary tests,18ccj4e,Head_Estate_3944,AOC claims ‘all’ underage women will face ‘genital examinations’ if biological men barred from female sports,"“Squad” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat-New York, claimed that “all” underage women will face “genital examinations” if biological men are barred from women’s sports.

Ocasio-Cortez made her claim during the Tuesday House Oversight Subcommittee on Health hearing featuring NCAA swimming legend and women’s sports advocate Riley Gaines.

The New York Democrat said there were several proposals looking to “marginalize” transgender Americans before claiming during her questioning that women would have to get their pants checked if someone disbelieves their stated gender.

“We are talking about opening up all women and girls to genital examinations when they are underage, potentially just because someone can point to someone and say, I don’t think you are a girl,” she claimed.

“And we’re saying this in an environment of a post-Dobbs America, where states are criminalizing access to abortion and want nothing more than data on women to figure out when, who’s getting a menstrual cycle, who doesn’t have one, and we’re supposed to believe this is going to make us better and safer?”

“I think not, and, per usual, I don’t believe we’re sitting here on a panel of men that has actually thought about the biology and privacy consequences of all women, trans or cisgendered,” the “Squad” Democrat added.

Ocasio-Cortez’s claim comes almost a year after the Ohio state Senate removed a controversial provision from a state House proposal barring biological men from competing against women, which would have required “internal and external” exams to confirm a student-athlete’s gender.

Ohio Senate Republicans replaced the provision with a requirement for student-athletes whose gender is in question to “present a copy of the participant’s original birth certificate” to compete.

“I’m not sure why that’s in the bill, it’s unnecessary,” State Senate President Matt Huffman said about the genital inspection provision in June 2022.

“All of these tests can be done with a simple DNA swab,” Huffman added.

Tuesday’s hearing saw fireworks from the get-go as Gaines, an outspoken advocate of keeping women’s sports limited to biological women, fired back at Ocasio-Cortez’s fellow “Squad”-mate, Rep. Summer Lee, Democrat -Pennsylvania.

Lee called Gaines’ testimony, as well as the testimonies of the other women leaders looking to restrict women’s sports to biological women, “transphobic” in her opening remarks.

Gaines blasted Lee, the ranking member of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Health, after the Squad member took her shot at the witnesses’ testimony.

“There’s a place for everybody to play sports in this country,” Gaines said, noting transgender Americans were included in her view. “But unsafe, unfair and discriminatory practices must stop.”",2023-12-06T19:53:45+00:00

Libertarian,comment,Single-payer system,iarn0ij,KristianLaw,,"It's not ""failing"", our Conservative party just keeps trying to chop it into little pieces and sell it off. 

The broad principle works very well, if the government respects the system and operates it correctly.

For example, when you accept that the light bulbs in a hospital need changing, so you hire a handyman/janitor to replace the bulbs.

Unfortunately, the conservatives (our version of the republicans you might say), are a lot like Putin (in fact they actively took donations from Putin and are very chummy with a bunch of oligarchs), in that they want to get themselves rich, and they want their friends to be rich, but they don't really care so much if everyone earning less than £1,000,000 per year lives in a tent.

They cannot sell the NHS outright, because if they did that the public would bucher them. There would be riots in the streets, kind of like if you tried to ban guns in the US.

Instead, what they've started doing is ""contracting out"" NHS services... which is like saying that you own your business, but someone else does the work and you pay them to do it. This works just as well as hiring a janitor if it's done well, you get a competitive company in to change the light bulbs etc and it's all great.

Alas, the conservatives have been getting their friends to provide the services, and paying them at a premium. Light bulbs at one point, were costing the taxpayer £200-400 each I believe. 

So, from your perspective, the conservatives will say ""oh no the NHS is failing, look how much money it costs!"" But from our perspective, there are corrupt politicians in government taking advantage of the system. Almost every British person in the UK holds to this ideal - even many Conservative voters.

The only real solution is for the NHS to be publicly owned but outside of government control - like the judiciary or channel 4 (which ironically, the conservatives are now attempting to sell 😂). You don't hear people complaining that it costs too much to prosecute murderers and that we should privatise the courts, because you can't sell that as a commodity though.",2022-06-01T09:31:23+00:00

Consider this scenario we have a notion that transportation is a right so we get it passed by law. You can now take a cab anywhere and it costs you nothing at all (except you pay for it through your taxes). Everyone starts using those taxis everywhere. Aka the demand skyrockets, and supply cant keep up with the demand so you get long waiting times. Everything is done to cut down the costs so wages dont go up and less people want to become a taxi driver, supply falls even more, waiting lines goes longer and longer and the state understands they have to pay more for it.

Edit. 

I just noticed the citations at the bottom of the graphic. For ABC they say they're referencing ""ABC World News"" which isn't a thing on its own. Their prime time broadcast is [""World News Tonight""](http://abcnews.go.com/WN?cid=marketing_search_brandedprograms_WNT)which airs for a half an hour every night, and their early morning show is called [""World News Now,""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_News_Now) which airs at an ungodly time in the morning, usually leading into your local morning newscast. For NBC they only referenced the [""NBC Nightly News,""](http://www.nbc.com/nbc-nightly-news) which has a half an hour run everyday in NBC's primetime lineup. For CBS they only referenced the [""CBS Evening News,""](http://www.cbsnews.com/evening-news/) which also only has a half an hour run every night in CBS' prime time slot.  

So while they throw up the logos for these broadcasters entire news divisions, and title the full screen ""MSM Coverage of..."" they only look at each broadcasters 30 minutes prime time newscasts, which after commercials you end with a run time of around 23 minutes. I think it might be fair to say that these numbers are a little cherry picked then. I would look to see if Fox ran anything about Lynch in their comparable newscast, but they don't have one, as they don't run a national newscast on the Fox network. ",2017-06-25T14:33:52+00:00

Jay will only pay more if he does nothing and allows BlueCross BlueShield to double his healthcare premium; but if he actually looks for a replacement plan on the Marketplace, he might even pay less than $711.83/mo he was paying before.

But of course, OP can't tell you whether or not the Marketplace offers a better plan for less than $711.83/mo because OP is not Jay. OP says he ""found"" this letter on the internet, but is actually Norwegian and ""enjoys"" the benefits of universal healthcare. ",2016-10-25T08:34:23+00:00

In a nutshell: the paper is wrong because the insurance company is giving you outdated premium health premiums. They go off the new (in this case 2017) rate but keep the old tax credit (from 2016) without updating the tax credit percentage to make it ""affordable"" (lol) 
They are supposed to give you a % based on the cost of the second lowest cost silver plan available to you....but what you see here is BCBS giving you their new rate without talking to the folks at the Marketplace to determine your new tax credit to match.

As  a big L Libertarian, I have mixed emotions about Medicaid.  I believe  in the force of competitive markets, that put the consumer in charge.

But  as a computer guy, I'm always pushing for more efficiency in the  system.  Daily.  And my doctor having thousands of different insurance  companies to deal with is very inefficient.  There is a lot of waste in  the system.

I might support a  single payer system if it came with the caveat ""any one caught stealing  from the system will be shot at dawn, and it will be broadcast  nationally.""

Libertarian,comment,Medicaid,k0uxb88,Free_Mixture_682,,"Before Medicare and Medicaid, the United States had the finest healthcare system in history. Healthcare costs were low and stable, to such an extent that most people didn’t even have major medical insurance. That’s because they didn’t need it. Going to the doctor was like going to the grocery store. How many people have grocery insurance to help them cover soaring grocery costs? Healthcare costs were just as low and stable as grocery store prices, so there was no need for major medical insurance.

At the same time, healthcare inventions and innovations were skyrocketing. Doctors loved what they were doing, and, equally important, the poor were being treated by both doctors and hospitals, purely on a voluntary basis.

Everything changed with the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid. Healthcare costs began soaring. Doctors and hospitals began entering into all sorts of complex and convoluted arrangements to deal with the increasing crisis. Consumers started buying major medical insurance. The federal government embarked on a series of never-ending reforms. Doctors began to hate what they do and started to retire early. The drive toward medical invention and innovation lost its vitality. Today, many consumers are being pushed into bankruptcy owing to enormous medical bills.

Medicare and Medicaid ended up destroying the finest healthcare system in history, and the healthcare crisis has become a permanent part of American life. Perhaps worst of all is the mindset of dependency that it has inculcated in the American people, many of whom are convinced that without Medicare and Medicaid people would be dying in the streets.

Improper payments represent payments that do not meet program requirements.

The vast majority of improper payments occur in regards to people who may be eligible for care, but for whom there was an unintentional payment error or a reviewer cannot determine if a payment was proper due to insufficient payment documentation from a state or a provider.

Improper payments do not necessarily represent expenditures that should not have occurred and can include both overpayments and underpayments situations where there is insufficient documentation to determine if a payment is proper in accordance with program payment requirements.

However, these improper payments do not necessarily represent payments to illegitimate providers or on behalf of ineligible beneficiaries. Had the missing information been on the claim and/or had the state complied with the enrollment or redetermination requirements, then the claims may have been payable. A smaller proportion of improper payments are instances where the State Agency had sufficient documentation to determine that payments should not have been made or should have been made in different amounts, which are considered monetary losses to the Federal Government (e.g., medical necessity, incorrect coding, and other errors).

Libertarian,comment,Medicare,i8yclgg,BenAustinRock,,"The argument for a Medicare for all system is that it is more efficient.  The evidence of that is unclear.  Health insurance companies use quite a bit of their administration costs trying to fight and limit fraud.  Why it is unclear on the efficiency stand point is that we don’t really know how much fraud there is for either private or public health insurance.  We have an idea on how much is caught.  Not how much occurs.  

Currently the government covers 35% of the population and spends 50% of all healthcare costs.  On the surface that is very inefficient, though a big part of that is Medicare where we are covering the elderly.  So not exactly apples to apples.  

If you look at what has changed over time that has resulted in great increases in healthcare related expenses it is the collapse of out of pocket expenses.  In the 1960s out of pocket expenses represented over  half of all health related expenses.  By the mid 1990s that had shrunk to 15% and is now less than 10.  The most efficient way to run an economy is to have people spending money on what they want and need.  That forces companies to compete over a variety of levels including price, quality, customer service, etc…. When people aren’t paying the bill why would companies compete over price?  When was the last advertisement for a health related item that even mentioned price?

Medicare and Medicaid increase the cost of healthcare as they exist now. Anytime you subsidize something through government funding, you artificially drive up the costs.

I'll mention student loans as an example. Since student loans are guaranteed by the government and you can never get out of them even within bankruptcy, the cost of college tuition and fees has gone up dramatically. The government sets some arbitrary maximum amount of money that students can borrow and universities continue to raise their tuition and fees to get all that free money. You can look at universities across the country building lavish dorms and gyms and athletic facilities with all the subsidized money that they're receiving.

College used to be cheap. And it makes more sense for student loans to be issued by a banks which can evaluate whether said student is likely to be able to repay the loan rather than just guarantee the loans to everybody whether or not they're going to repay it.

No, socialized healthcare is NOT the way to go, but we can't let people screw over people with conditions that are expensive enough to kill them.

My mother, grandmother, several in my extended family, and my friends' girlfriend all have type 1 diabetes. I care about all of them. I can't even comprehend why insurance companies should be allowed to deny someone this. Insulin is expensive enough to make it impossible to buy gas or groceries. Without insurance my mother's insulin would be 1250 a month. That's more than we can pay for at all.

Why are we comparing this to car insurance? Cars are material objects. They're replaceable. A human life is not.

Libertarian,comment,Pre-existing conditions,dh8xyxc,fyzbo,,"Scenario: A person has insurance all his life.  During adulthood he gets a nice steady job that provides an insurance plan.  At age 35 he gets sick, thankfully it's treatable, but unfortunately he now needs an expensive monthly condition.  His insurance covers it, after all this was an unexpected tragedy and that is what insurance is for.

At age 45 he get a great idea for a new business.  This business could be industry changing and he wants to pursue it.  It will take a few years to build the business, but that's OK because he has savings.  So he looks into venturing off on his own, only to realize that he now has a ""pre-existing condition"" and no one will provide insurance.  He can't afford to start the business AND his monthly medications.  Plus, what if some other unexpected issue arises, he is over 40 and taking on a high stress endeavor.  He realizes he can't start his business.

His current employer finds out.  Realizing the position they are now in, they cut his salary by 75% to minimum wage, they would go lower if possible.  He can't leave his job as he needs in the insurance.  He can't buy his own insurance due to his ""pre-existing condition"".  He is now effectively slave labor.

We've hurt the economy by stifling new businesses and in the process helped large corporations maintain the best talent.  How is this a good thing?

Perhaps instead of forcing insurance companies to accept applicants with pre-existing conditions, we should make them pay for all expenses (current & future) related to a condition when it arises.  Had insurance, no problem they will pay for everything.  Need new insurance, that's fine too because your current condition is covered by your last insurance company, so the new company will just deal with future issues.  Didn't have insurance, while enjoy your life of poverty, or more likely die.

I just can't see an easy solution to long term illness.  It's not pre-existing when it first happens, but it now prevents the person for leaving jobs, switching provides, moving, etc.  It can also allow an employer or insurance provider to change the agreement by raising prices and the person has very little recourse.

At the end of the day, I think you are going to have a hard time winning an argument for any system where a person can die for an otherwise treatable disease for being too poor.  Whatever system you want, you need to start by fulfilling that, and then moving on them there.

In our system, letting insurance companies prince discriminate creates a system where you can die from a treatable disease for being too poor.  Hell, I don't think you will win much support for a system where you can still be randomly and arbitrarily financially ruined by health.  It's just too easy for people to point to other nations that have manged to this.  It isn't theoretical.

If you were paying privately, the price will continue to rise until you can't afford it, if you had an employer plan you can never leave that job.  That one car accident means you are no longer insurable.

If I get into a car accident, I expect the insurance company to cover all costs past my deductible.

Nevada and Washington state, for example, are requiring this coverage. The insurance will cover visits to a dentist for basic or preventive services, such teeth cleaning, X-rays and fillings, and medically necessary orthodontics.

Libertarian,comment,healthcare costs,j0gqom0,GravyMcBiscuits,,"Take any service industry you know and add the following restrictions:

The tech performing the service requires a government mandated PHd+ regardless of the particular service being rendered. Only government approved schools are allowed to offer that PHd+ program and the number of seats is restricted by a centrally controlled board. After they are done with their education, the service person must work for 1 year with 80+ hours/week for crap pay. Only government-approved service centers are allowed to offer that internship program and the number of seats is heavily restricted. The consumer is not allowed to purchase parts or do any work unless they first get the written permission of a government-approved technician.

At the parts counter .. the person you are buying parts from also requires a government-mandated PHd+ degree with limited schools/seats. They also had to do the grueling 1 year internship with limited orgs/seats. The consumer is not allowed to purchase or possess any of the parts sold unless they first have written permission from the government-approved tech above and sold to them by a government-approved parts seller.

The manufacturers of the parts/equipment also must seek government approval before they are allowed to sell anything to anyone. The government also imposes incredibly expensive procedures before the manufacturer is granted permission to sell supplies.

If you apply these restrictions to any industry, it will not take long before a good chunk of the population is priced out of the market.

I remember a few years ago he ended up having to put a mortgage on his house because one of his clerical people did something along the lines of misspelled a word or two on a government form that they have been filing for something like 20 years for reimbursement. They absolutely refused to make a payment to him, in the order of a half million dollars because of a very minor clerical error. When he got on the phone eventually with a decision maker in the government they admitted that it was a minor mistake not a big deal and should be fixed quickly. I think in the end he waited 9 months for payment and only saw action when he went to a state senator here in Ohio who then brought it up to someone over Medicare about this doctor not being paid did it resolve.

I just cannot fathom that this local doctor is the only guy with a independent practice that has ever had this thing happen period he very much asserted to me this was a common thing period just imagine that level of money that gets passed on to the customer just because of paperwork.

Libertarian,comment,healthcare costs,j0hl4zg,Conditional-Sausage,,"My first thoughts are this: Regulation causes high prices. EU members are famously intensely regulatory, so they should have more and tougher regulations on healthcare. If regulation causes expensive healthcare, it seems to follow that more regulation would make it more expensive. However, what we actually see is the opposite: it's much cheaper to get care in EU member nations. Even countries where healthcare is still private but heavily regulated (for example, the Netherlands), healthcare is a fraction of the price it is here. I reject your proposition.

As for the AMA and medical licensing. Medical licensing was aggressively enforced in the wake of the 1918 influenza pandemic because there was a wide range of quality in medical education, ranging from outright quackery to bleeding edge medicine. On top of that, many doctors were failing to practice evidence based medicine and evolve their practice according to evidence. The 1918 pandemic strained the medical system past the breaking point and revealed these as major flaws that absolutely did need addressing. I think that the surge in mid-level providers treating patients is kind of a mostly neutral side effect of the doctor shortage, not that they're really much better or more efficient than doctors. What I would hate to see is a return to the bad old days of any old school being able to make ""doctors"" (those are sarcasm quotes) or anyone being able to just declare themselves a doctor. The medical landscape is already opaque enough to a lot of patients as it is, especially in the misinformation age, we don't need people pushing crystals and homeopathy wrapping themselves in a further cloak of legitimacy by doing a two week online course to call themselves doctors.

On the other hand, I also disagree with allowing an advocacy organization to be the sole credentialing body for professional licensing. The AMA has openly stated that they aim to keep the supply of doctors right so that doctors can be 'rewarded for their education' (price gouge). They've also very openly resisted the recognition of almost every other country's medical credentials. I think, as it is, the only credentials that we de facto recognize are Canadian and English, which is a load of bunk, but it's how the AMA tries to keep supplies tight. I would LOVE to break the AMA's credentialing monopoly; I've often fantasized about the government establishing an optional shall-issue credentialing standard for medical schools, where as long as a college can meet the requirements, the government will credential them to teach doctors.

Medicare and Medicaid can price set, limiting profits on the 40% of not working Americans it covers, shifting 100% of the costs and profitability onto the shoulders of the 60% of working class Americans.

You forgot that government is in the equation.

Fair competition doesn't exist when government is involved.

""Why doesn't competition in schools bring tuition down?""

Because they have little incentive to. You can get loans for having a pulse in the US which leads to schools accepting anyone at any costs. The students don't feel the burden directly and have been groomed all their life to go to school or else they will be a loser. Healthcare is more complicated but it's the same story.",2023-07-27T16:27:59+00:00
Libertarian,comment,single payer,jtp13qy,rendrag099,,">Why doesn’t competition between hospitals and between health insurance companies drive costs down?

There is so much gov intervention into the healthcare market that there isn't as much competition as you think.

For example, if you want to open, expand, purchase, etc... certain healthcare facilities, you have to get a [Certificate of Need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_need) from the local/federal gov, which faces intense opposition from existing healthcare organizations in order to restrict the supply of facilities. As another example, the AMA artificially restricts the supply of doctors explicitly in order to drive up their price. And lastly, you can't buy an insurance plan available for sale in another State, you are required to purchase only plans available for sale in your State, subject to the local bureaucratic whims of what the coverage requirements for those plans, whether you want that coverage or not.

Those are just 3 examples off the top of my head. The rabbit hole goes much deeper.",2023-07-27T18:07:03+00:00

Libertarian,comment,single payer,jtr4md7,sw33t_lady_propane,,"I was born and raised in Canada and now live and work in the US as a Healthcare economist. The short answer to why Healthcare is so expensive in the US is that general market principals don't apply.  To have a free market you need many buyers and sellers who have full information about the good being sold. In health care, very few buyers are knowledgeable about medicine and they rely on what physicians say they need. Further, most health care is paid by insurance, so buyers are not very sensitive to the cost of care.  Finally, physicians and hospitals have an incentive to over diagnose and treat disease to avoid malpractice suits. 

The Canadian system is not without serious problems, however. In most cases when life is at immediate risk, care is quick and excellent. However, when the issue is injury or disease that impacts quality of life (but not mortality) waiting periods are horribly long.  I think of my elderly parents in Alberta who, when they needed hip replacements, had to endure horrible pain and almost complete lack of mobility before Alberta Health would schedule the surgery. I've also been very disappointed with the way mental health services are handled in Alberta. 

If I had insurance (which I do) I would much rather be part of the US system. But if you are poor and can't afford insurance, and don't quality for Medicaid, the Canadian system will at least keep you alive.",2023-07-28T02:42:37+00:00
Libertarian,comment,single payer,jtskqnj,Free_Mixture_682,,"The interesting thing about the US health care system is that it quite literally embodies the worst aspects of every system.

The VA and Indian Health Service (IHS) are systems wholly owned and operated by the government, like the NHS in the UK. IHS has been cited as perhaps the worst healthcare provided anywhere in the US. The VA is not far behind.

Medicare and Medicaid are something like Canada and other universal care countries but instead of covering the entire population, each is designated for portions. Medicare is for people 65 and older. Medicaid is for the indigent.

All told these systems cover a large percentage of the population. I have read it is more than half. 

One problem with Medicare that differs from Canada’s system is the lack of rationing. This is another reason I say the US has the worst of all worlds. Rationing is the only means for government systems to hold down costs. But that does not exist in the Medicaid system. So the amount of money flowing to the providers is one of many reasons the cost of care in the US is always so high per capita.

The rest of the market is totally distorted by third party payers, employer provided insurance, state and federal regulations, federal tax policy, the list is insanely long.

The solution libertarians would advocate is to begin to remove these distortions and allow a market system to develop. Currently, no such system exists.

I say this because, aside from the large portion on government healthcare as listed above, the negotiated prices between providers and insurers are based not on supply and demand but instead on the price Medicare reimburses for the same service. That is the basis for negotiation between the providers and insurers. By definition, this is not a free market. Without the price system and with the users of a service not being actively informed of pricing since they are not the ones paying, this is not a market system.

Generally speaking, I believe most libertarians would like to see a system where the free market and competition are able to bring about better service, innovation and price competition. I believe most agree that the place to start is the regulatory and tax structure. 

A simplistic vision for a more market oriented healthcare system might involve a combination of health savings accounts for most annual medical expenses and catastrophic coverage for anything that fits that category. And said insurance could be purchased at lower rates through group purchasing plans.

This is not comprehensive because there are other needs in healthcare aside from once a year checkups and a couple of visits for minor needs like cuts, strep throat, etc. But it does offer a path away from government run or rationed government funded care.",2023-07-28T12:07:37+00:00

Libertarian,comment,single payer,jtpkgnf,Intelligent_Fee3657,,"The US cartelizes the medical profession using the AMA - artifically restricting supply of doctors / medical centers to raise hospital prices and doctor incomes. Before the AMA, medical fraternities were popular in the US which allowed for very affordable medical care, but the AMA banned this to increase prices.

The US gov subsidizes employers to employers who provide employee medical insurance and restricts insurance competition across state lines. Consumers are less likely to price discriminate (they're not paying for the procedure) and healthcare providers are incentivized to provide treatments that are only marginally better at a much increased cost. This is counter to how price mechanism works - where consumers search for the least costly providers.

Medicare/Medicaid artificially increases demand for medical care and is like employer insurance, but the employer being the US Government, which is a not a business with no cost saving motive, but a political incentive to offer its constituents greater array of coverage.

The FDA also allows monopolization of drug patents enabling inflated drug prices and as an entity acts as a barrier for competition and medical advancements in the US.

Its quite complicated but TLDR:  Over regulation and government intervention is the cause of high medical costs.

Side note: The US already has quasi socialized healthcare, in full socialized healthcare such as Canada, UK, etc you dont have ""free"" healthcare, you pay much greater taxes there compared to the US even if you dont need the healthcare. You also have much greater waiting lists for treatments where you may have no other choice but to come to the US for procedures.

The vaccines carry a very, very small short-term risk but given my natural immunity, there was no reason to take on even a tiny risk other than the authority demand that vaccines are required to get back to normal. My current employer requires masks on-site if you don't have vaccine proof. An antibody test isn't sufficient, only a vaccination.

Many people like me did the same and we started getting back to normal but the goal posts have been moved and there's pressure for new mask mandates. If I wasn't going to get a normal life back, I wouldn't have gotten vaccinated. I see a lot of complaints on various social media sites, but what can we really do to protest new mandates?

A local store just announced that all customers (vaccinated or not) have to wear masks. No problem. I'll go to their competitor. What can I do when all the competitors require masks.

At work, I'll share my opinion that masks are unnecessary, but it's not my decision. I can't afford to quit and I can't work from home 100% of the time. Again, I'm forced to comply.

What are our options for practical resistance/protests?

EDIT - I guess I wasn't clear. I support the *right* of private businesses to require whatever they want. If I don't like it, I protest by going elsewhere. However, as more and more business give in to the cries of ""we need masks again"" there won't be any elsewhere to go to. There's also government pressure for private businesses to require masks (at least around here). They issue statements encouraging masking and hinting that mandates *might* have to be issued if masks remain optional. That makes this entire issue more than a simple discussion of private business rights.  ",2021-08-02T01:45:02+00:00

Libertarian,comment,unnecessary tests,h7gze5m,CaptainAutismFFS,,"Vaccination, as you stated, is not perfect immunity.

Breakthrough cases, or cases of a disease infecting a person whom has already been immunized to that specific virus, happen, and they're becoming more frequent.

This is not necessarily a threat to the vaccinated whom become infected, but *these people can still spread the virus*.

And if the virus spreads enough, regardless of the vaccination status of those who become infected, eventually it will mutate into something the vaccine will not properly protect us from, bringing us right back where we started, destroying both over half of a year of 'round the clock research, and literally billions of dollars of taxpayer dollars.

Now, let me get to the issue that I take (regardless of my emotional agreement) to the ""If you chose not to protect yourself, you reap what you sow"" mindset:

*Every single infection* has a chance to become a new variant, one that vaccines may not protect against. One that could kill a fuck ton of people.

This is how the Delta variant came to be. The standard form of COVID-19 infected a person, and as the virus multiplied within this Delta patient zero, it was not perfectly replicated, and literally cubed the rate at which this new virus could spread, changing the R^0 of the virus, the average amount of people whom an infected person can in turn infect, changed from 3... To 9.

In short, *every single infection* is a loss. *Every single infection* could drastically shift the odds of us losing any semblance of control on the virus's spread.

As masking up lowers the rate of transmission, it improves the odds of getting enough people vaccinated to reach herd immunity before the virus mutates into something that the vaccine can't protect us from.",2021-08-02T20:37:00+00:00

The correct answer, in my view is to push a Canada-type state-driven solution (in Canada each province is the primary insurer of its residents).  Now that Vermont has gone single payer we should be offering the state of Vermont the ability to take on Medicare as a block grant and roll it into their general care for all and let the state negotiate fees again.

The reason is that the federal government effectively runs (through Medicaid strings or Medicare) around half of the health care expenditures in the US.  If this could be rolled into state programs and the federal strings reduced (to give the states real room to negotiate prices, etc), this would mean the end of Medicare and Medicaid as we know them.

I will never support a federal single payer system because I think that centralized government power tends to be used to the benefit of centralized businesses, but I am right of center and I know a lot of others on the right who *would* support a system where basic coverage decisions would be made closer to home, if not on the community level, at least on the state level.

This isn't just a government vs free market issue, it is the extent to which people can effectively change policy.  With the federal government people have no ability to do that.  On the local level, and even the state level, they have more of a chance.  If nothing else they have at least something of a chance to move to another state.

Liberal,comment,Universal healthcare,kwjculi,TaxLawKingGA,,"There are a lot of obstacles to universal healthcare in the U.S., at least as that term is defined by many liberals and progressives, which is some form of single-payer (i.e., Medicare for all) or in the extreme, a British style National Health Service (i.e., think VA Health writ large).  If you were to try and ban private health insurance in its entirety, you are likely to get a lawsuit. Anybody want to guess how this Court would rule on such a case?  In addition, so many people in the U.S. work in healthcare, both as providers, administrators, janitors, accountants, etc., that nationalizing it would cause severe job loss and would be an electoral loser.  A limited plan that only targets the poor would be unpopular with the general public.

The best way to go, to me, is to create a U.S. government competitor (i.e., public option) and offer it to people. Eventually, everyone would sign up for it and the others would either go out of business or simply focus only on the wealthiest customers. Everyone else would get coverage.  The other option, which I think is where Obamacare was going, is to regulate health insurance like a public utility. This is what they do in Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands. 

The other thing that needs to happen, and this is where I think Dems have dropped the ball, is that we should push for a national medical plan for all kids under the age of 26. Call it MediKid, and make it open to everyone, not just the poor. We have to stop with this constant means testing of everything. We have the money and can afford it. We just have to be willing to run on it and defend it everywhere and to everyone. The benefit of such a plan is that it would take kids off of the private health insurance rolls. If kids really are our future, then we should treat their healthcare like we treat their education: it should be publicly subsidized regardless of income, race, ethnicity, sex or religion. 

Finally, the government should go after the AMA and Medical School Industrial Complex and demand that we open more medical schools so that we can get more doctors. We are in an acute doctor's shortage and it is going to get worse. Unless we are just going to keep importing more doctors from foreign countries that have terrible bedside manner and speak poor English, we should be training our own citizens for this work.",2024-03-25T20:06:49+00:00

The US didn't do this - it allowed anyone to build a hospital and run it themselves, municipalities, companies, and religious/non-profit organizations alike at nominal fees. 

What this means is that the US, unlike other countries, has many independent hospitals rather than a unified system. Insurance was a way to unify these hospitals and get them to normalize the price competition between them, hospitals with outrageous prices ended up closing down or capitulating to their regime. Regulations made them legitimate.

The issue with the US, of course, is that the 5th Amendment exists. Yes, the one that protects you from incriminating yourself, and also the government taking things from you. Publicizing healthcare requires the US government pay the fair market value of what's taken from its shareholders - whether that's a hospital or an insurance agency.

The current market capitalization of healthcare in the US is projected to reach $6T in coming years. We currently **spend** $6T annually, and that's before realizing the government then needs to run those hospitals, not just buy them as-is.

So what we're talking about is roughly doubling the current federal budget to destroy private healthcare. It's just not going to happen. We can't afford to. The move instead is to slowly but surely tweak the system we have to be better through better regulations.",2024-03-25T19:20:22+00:00

>After the passage of President Joe Biden’s first Covid-19 relief plan, nearly 7 million additional uninsured Americans now qualify for free health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, according to new federal projections shared exclusively with Vox.


Just try!


>Roughly 29 million people currently living in the US lack health insurance. According to the new HHS estimates, at least 6.8 million of them could now purchase an ACA plan with no monthly premium, and another 1.3 million could sign up for a health plan that costs less than $50 a month. Many of those people already qualified for free or low-cost coverage prior to the ARP, but based on the federal projections, the new law’s expansion of the ACA made an additional 2 million Americans eligible for free or cheap coverage.

Liberal,comment,Premiums,i1mfcfy,Walk1000Miles,,"The Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare, has many guarantees that people really seem to have forgotten.

Before the ACA, there __were no dependable guarantees__ when it came to your healthcare plan. Now?

>A requirement that health plans must permit you to enroll regardless of health status, age, gender, or other factors that might predict the use of health services. Except in some states, guaranteed issue doesn't limit how much you can be charged if you enroll.

Now? More than ever before? Americans really have an opportunity to get health care coverage.

Coverage that they could really use.

>Low-income Americans who missed signing up for 2022 Affordable Care Act coverage can now enroll in plans with $0 premiums through the federal exchange's website.

Due to the pandemic? The ACA is offering health care choices for many people who lacked heath care opportunities. Including? Additional help with premium costs and increasing household income levels for easier approval.

>The expanded enrollment opportunity stems from the Democrats' $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package, which was enacted last year. In addition to temporarily providing more generous subsidies that reduce premiums to $0 or close to it for low-income folks, the law allows them to sign up outside of the traditional open enrollment season, which ended in mid-January.

There is no guarantee that Congress will provide an extension for the health care premium assistance allotment.

>The special enrollment period could run beyond 2022 if Congress extends the enhanced premium assistance, which expires after this year.

The __ACA has three goals:__

>■ Make affordable health insurance available to more people. The law provides consumers with subsidies (“premium tax credits”) that lower costs for households with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL).

>• If your income is above 400% FPL, you may still qualify for the premium tax credit in 2022.

>• If your income is at or below 150% FPL, you may qualify to enroll in or change Marketplace coverage through a Special Enrollment Period.

>■ Expand the Medicaid program to cover all adults with income below 138% of the FPL. (Not all states have expanded their Medicaid programs).

>■ Support innovative medical care delivery methods designed to lower the costs of health care generally.

You have nothing to lose by applying.

Remember? __Each state is different.__

Your ability to have access to certain plans depend on what your __state Governor decided to do when the ACA came about.__ Some states are actually signing up for the ACA now because they realize how much it is truly needed.

>Some states have expanded their Medicaid programs to cover all people with household incomes below a certain level. Others haven’t. Whether you qualify for Medicaid coverage depends partly on whether your state has expanded its program.

My next door neighbor used to pay $400 a month for their insurance plan. Now, they have one of the ACA plans and they play $6.30 a month.

It's based on his income. He receives subsidies to pay the costs of the plan. He receives:

■ Dental,

■ Vision,

■ Out patient care,

■ Yearly check ups,

■ X-rays, MRIs, CAT scans,

■ Emergency care,

■ Hospitalization,

■ Pharmaceuticals,

■ Urgent care,

■ Surgery,

■ Psychological therapy and

■ Physical therapy.

Anything that you could possibly want.

You said:

>Sure, but a lot of low premium ACA plans also carry high deductibles. Private health insurance plans - including - government - sponsored ACA plans - with (a) a low premium, (b) a low deductible, and (c) robust coverage are virtually non-existent. Unless you have (non-ACA) group health insurance that is heavily subsidized by your employer, you’d be extremely lucky to find health insurance that has two of those features, let alone all three. Edit: ask your neighbor what their deductible is.

My friend has a $ 600.00 annual deductible.

Remember?

States that *did not seek Medicaid expansion* don't have the same programs / options available as states that did. It __really depends__ on what:

■ state you live in,

■ plans are available in your state, and

■ your Governor has decided to do in regards to Medicaid expansion.

>38 states and DC have accepted federal funding to expand Medicaid under the ACA.

__Medicaid expansion states: Key takeaways__ [here](https://www.healthinsurance.org/medicaid).

Edit - moved statement about friends deductible to top of page.",2022-03-23T02:07:44+00:00
Liberal,comment,Premiums,i1nq6pl,Walk1000Miles,,"Since the new law regarding eligibility was just passed, you should try.

However - as everyone knows? The Governor of your state needs to accept certain components of the ACA.

>Although 18.4% of Texans were still uninsured as of 2019, a substantial number of Texas residents have obtained health coverage since the ACA was implemented. However, the number of people gaining coverage would be far higher if Texas were to accept federal funding to expand Medicaid under the ACA.

Then? The people that live in that state suffer. I'm sorry for you that you have to go through that.

>Texas lawmakers noted that a state-based rate review program will allow them to ensure that health insurance companies take a uniform approach to “silver loading” the cost of cost-sharing reductions, which will increase the size of premium subsidies that Texas residents receive. S.B.1296 took effect in September 2021, but the rate review season for 2022 plans was already nearly over by that point. So the federal government finalized the rates for 2022, and the Texas Department of Insurance will take over in the spring of 2022, reviewing the rate filings that are submitted for 2023 coverage.

It is *confusing* to say the least. But __you have nothing to you lose by reapplying.__ See if the new federal poverty level (FPL) guidelines help you.

And writing your governor and other Representatives.

I know I would!

*Write your governor.*

__Texas is one of fourteen states that has not accepted the Medicaid enrollment__ feature.

However? That __has not stopped__ people that live in Texas from enrolling in the ACA.

>Texas has one of the highest exchange enrollments in the country – and enrollment reached a record high 1,840,947 people enrolled in private individual market plans in 2022.

Because of the __recent changes__ approved by President Biden? There's nothing wrong with you trying to see what happens in regards to your eligibility and rate.

>The proposed and approved rate changes only apply to full-price plans, and very few enrollees pay full price for plans that are purchased through the exchange (as of February 2021, 92% of Texas exchange enrollees were receiving premium subsidies, and that percentage increased a few months later, once the American Rescue Plan was implemented).

Notify your state's Governor and the Congress (which consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate) that you ___ARE___ watching them and paying attention to what they are doing and saying.

It is attributed to 'stupid' foreign policy by both far ends, ""commies"" and fascists, while in reality you have to go back 40 years...and also why 40 years ago the people with brains warned of what economical liberalism really is.

Liberal,comment,single payer,e26wv4j,sgarfio,,"I live in Colorado and we had universal health care on the ballot in 2016. There was a pretty detailed financial proposal for it, so I did the math for my personal situation. I currently pay, between my and my employer's contributions, about $15k a year for a family policy with a $4k deductible. Under the proposed Colorado health care plan, I would have paid around $8k in additional tax (again, between me and my employer, and this was after a ramp-up period where I would pay less). There were no deductibles, just co-pays that were pretty reasonable and would probably never equal the $4k deductible I currently have. So $8-10k in tax and co-pays versus $15-19k in insurance premiums and deductible. And it would have covered more than just my family. 

We're pretty healthy. This year is only the second time in 22 years that we've met the deductible. The only other time was when I gave birth to my now 19-year-old daughter. So 90% of the time, we get no benefit other than negotiated rates and the ability to put pre-tax money in an HSA. And nobody else gets to use it either because it's only for us. 

The Colorado bill failed miserably - 80% against. I didn't expect it to pass, but I had hoped it would have a little better showing than that and maybe get reworked and put back on the ballot. I guess only 20% of the voters did the math. Either that or there's just a huge stigma against paying for things as a tax instead of to a private corporation.

Liberal,comment,single payer,e27byv7,GreatWyrm,,"""I guess only 20% of the voters did the math.""

Probably less than that, because people don't vote on facts -- they vote on values. It's a scientific fact that people understand our world through the lense of various metaphors, and the relevant metaphor for politics is that of family. A nation is a family, and the conservative movement has successfully framed their morally and economically bankrupt hostility to actual health*care* reform as a 'family value.'

But in fact the privatized health market is devoid of family values -- there is only apathy, greed, and inefficiency. We are living in a house of absentee parents, who welcome the wild bear of the insurance industry in when what we need is care. Not only that -- the bear is invited to tear open the fridge, devour everything it wants, and in return hand us bandaids for broken bones and cancer. If the fridge is state-of-the-art and stuffed with gourmet vittles, the bear might pull an aching tooth -- and then demand a $500 bottle of wine for the aspirin it gives us for the pain. If a child has a bedroom full of golden-fruit sculptures, the bear will do everything it can for that child, and neglect the others all the more.

What we in the U.S. need is family values in our healthcare -- and in order to get them, we'll need to promote those values to the electorate.",2018-07-11T17:33:03+00:00

Liberal,post,big pharma,clbi9o,TheLegendarySheep,Why Big Pharma Needs to Die - Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bong,"During the first night of the second round of the 2019 Democratic Primary Debates, hosted by CNN, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders criticized debate moderator Jake Tapper and the network itself for airing pharmaceutical commercial One of the advertisements in question, which argued that Sanders' proposed Medicare for All plan would stifle innovation in the biopharmaceutical industry, was paid for by a national pharmaceutical special interest group, PhRMA. PhRMA is a coalition of pharmaceutical sales firms and manufacturers united by one common interest - Preventing legislation moving toward single-payer healthcare by any means necessary. Now, what we know for sure is that a number of enormous drug companies pay membership dues to this de facto lobbyist organization to slander progressive candidates on its behalf. We also know that CNN accepts the checks. 

But I decided to dig a little bit deeper. I was curious about the taxpayer assistance these individual companies receive from the state and federal government. I've compiled, using subsidytracker.com, the money these member corporations have received over the past few decades from their state and the federal government through grants, loans, and loan financing. I've made the judgement call not to include their tax rebates because, frankly, I'm not exactly sure that that money is arbitrary granted to the company from the government. Are these statistics cherry picked? Perhaps. But I just turned 18 and I have a limited attention span. Also, I'm not sure how much information there is on the internet that can confirm or deny my suspicions that these corporations use taxpayer money to directly fund anti-M4A propaganda.

Liberal,post,unnecessary tests,9qjuz2,deaconheel,Pro-Choice is the Only Choice,"This one might ruffle some feathers, but let’s give it a try. If you want a society with fewer abortions, your only choice is to vote for Democrats. That is the only party with a platform that will actually reduce the number of abortions - access to birth control, comprehensive sex education, expanding access to health care like Planned Parenthood (most importantly prenatal care), even affordable education and early childcare/welfare/food stamps to provide economic assistance after birth make a huge impact on the frequency of abortions. Not coincidentally, these are the planks of the Democratic platform.

The Republican answer is to simply ban the medical practice, which doesn’t prevent abortions but makes them less safe for the mothers. Outlawing abortions also fails to acknowledge the instances in which abortions are a medical necessity or the least bad of two choices. It’s not a good choice, but is one that many hopeful mothers are forced to make - when the genetic or ultrasound tests show that the fetus will not survive the pregnancy or the birth. It is a terrible decision but one that a mother/father must make with the physician. Sometimes that heartbreaking choice is not available until after 20 weeks. The Republicans insert themselves between a women and her OB/GYN with unnecessary testing and sometimes force the physician to lie.

I understand that some people see this as a black and white issue, but as with most things in life, the practice is quite gray. There are legitimate, medical reasons for abortions or induced miscarriages, and they are all sad and terrible. If if there wasn’t a medical reason, this should be a decision a woman gets to make for her own self, her own body. The answer isn’t to make the women criminals or punish the physicians. The answer is to make the practice an unnecessary as possible and that is where Democratic policies win the argument hands down.",2018-10-23T00:41:18+00:00

neoliberal,post,Affordable Care Act,i5ilzr,MaximumEffort433,[Rant] I'm sick and tired of people pointing to the Affordable Care Act as proof that Democrats don't care about health care.,"You know, can I rant here?  People give shit to Democrats for the imperfections of the Affordable Care Act, and I get it, the culmination of the ACA, what the legislative and practical results were, were not perfect, what it ended up as is not everything that I wanted it to be.    

First let's look at [the ACA as it passed *in the House:*](https://www.politico.com/story/2009/11/house-passes-historic-health-bill-029282) It had just about everything you'd want, it had a public option, it had market regulations, it had subsidies, it had price controls, it helped Medicare, it helped Medicaid, it had patient, doctor, and consumer protections, the Democratic House passed a really progressive health care plan.  
  
Meanwhile, in the Senate, [it was a single Independent Senator, Joe Lieberman, who was responsible for the elimination of the public option from the ACA, because he wouldn't vote to break the Republican filibuster.](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0363)  *Hundreds* of Democrats voted in favor of a  public option, it passed the Democratic house *easily,* but because it only had *majority* support, and not a *filibuster breaking* majority in the Senate, we had to remove what was arguably the most popular and progressive provision of the bill.  

The simple fact of the matter is that we shouldn't have had to nuke the filibuster to get the ACA passed as it was, largely, a conservative plan.  Obama picked [a health care policy first introduced by the conservative Heritage Foundation](https://healthjournalism.org/blog/2017/02/looking-at-the-conservative-heritage-of-some-core-aca-features/), first [proposed by Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2012/02/07/the-tortuous-conservative-history-of-the-individual-mandate/#1ca0192b55fe), and first [successfully implemented by Republican Governor Mitt ""Mittens"" Romney](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/23/451200436/mitt-romney-finally-takes-credit-for-obamacare), we thought, we *all* thought, that this bill would *sail* through Congress.  Instead Republican obstructionism was historically unprecedented, they were unified against this President in a way unseen since the civil war.  (I'm not being hyperbolic, go look at [charts of political polarization in Congress,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/23/a-stunning-visualization-of-our-divided-congress/) it's *actually* the worst it's been since the civil war.  Also this article is from 2015, but it's a good insight into what Obama was dealing with)  If Republicans had stood by their principles and acted in the best interests of their constituents then we wouldn't have *needed* Joe Lieberman, we would have had more than enough votes to get the bill passed.  In a sane, normal, rational world this wouldn't have been a controversial bill at all, but Republicans chose unanimous opposition and filibustering.   
  
Then [Republican Governors turned down a fully funded, deficit neutral Medicaid expansion that would have benefitted the most underprivileged uninsured citizens of their state.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/upshot/missouri-election-medicaid-expansion.html?campaign_id=29&emc=edit_up_20200806&instance_id=21024&nl=the-upshot&regi_id=68337520&segment_id=35412&te=1&user_id=b6e55f6f6979146395b2946f4fb0e01e)  (At literally no fiscal cost to them or the federal government.)  
  
Then [Republican Representatives and Senators gutted the consumer protections and the financial subsidies that would have improved quality of care for insured and uninsured Americans alike.](https://www.cbpp.org/sabotage-watch-tracking-efforts-to-undermine-the-aca)  
  
Then [Republican political operatives took the Affordable Care Act to the Supreme Court to get provisions like the individual mandate](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200626.180922/full/) and the [birth control mandate thrown out as unconstitutional.](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/07/08/supreme-court-opt-out-affordable-care-act-birth-control-mandate/)  
  
It was [Republicans who held the Bush tax cuts hostage,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obama-taxes/obama-challenges-republicans-to-keep-tax-cuts-for-middle-class-idUSBRE86805220120709) refusing to continue tax cuts for the 99% unless the 1% got to keep their breaks too, the ACA was written with the end of the Bush tax cuts for the 1% in mind, that's how the law was to be funded, but Republicans said *either we raise taxes on everybody, rich and poor alike, during the worst economic crisis in a lifetime, or nobody.*  
  
Like, the [Affordable Care Act *as it passed in the House,*](https://www.politico.com/story/2009/11/house-passes-historic-health-bill-029282) was a fucking fantastic law!  It had regulations, subsidies, a public option, price controls, you name it, it was a *good* law.  The [Affordable Care Act as it passed in the Senate](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0447) was.... okay.  It wasn't nearly as revolutionary as the House bill was, but it still accomplished a fair amount of good.  The Affordable Care Act *after being gutted and torn to shreds by intentional Republican incompetence* is where the problem lies.  The Democrats made a good faith effort to get the American people a good health care law, with a public option and extensive private market regulations and protections, it was Joe Lieberman and the Republicans who blew it all to kingdom come.  
  
But at the end of the day, what did the fucked up homunculus of a law that is the Affordable Care Act, actually *achieve?*  Well, [among many, many other things, 20,000,000 uninsured Americans got health insurance coverage.](https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/chart-book-accomplishments-of-affordable-care-act#:~:text=Thanks%20to%20the%20Affordable%20Care,people%20have%20gained%20health%20coverage.)  (Though, to be fair, [that number has dropped by more than 2 million people since Republicans took control of the federal Government in 2017.](https://khn.org/news/number-of-americans-without-insurance-rises-in-2018/))  
  
Is the Affordable Care Act *perfect?*  Is it *fucking perfect?*  Shit no.  But I'm tired of people saying ""The Democrats don't care about your health, just look at that flaccid farce of a health care bill they passed in 2010!""  *WE TRIED TO FIX THIS SHIT, [WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIX THIS SHIT FOR DECADES!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_health_care_plan_of_1993)*  (If you think Democrats don't care about health care, whatever the fuck you do, don't look up Ted Kennedy.)  
  
[*Franklin Delano Roosevelt,* a Democrat, thought health care was a basic human right.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bill_of_Rights#:~:text=The%20right%20of%20every%20family,right%20to%20a%20good%20education.)  (Oh, and [Social Security, which FDR is responsible for, currently covers nearly 64 million Americans.](https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/basicfact-alt.pdf))  

[*Lyndon B. Johnson,* a Democrat, is responsible for the creation of Medicare and Medicaid.](http://www.lbjlibrary.org/press/media-kit/medicare-and-medicaid)  (Medicare [currently gives more than 60 million Americans health insurance.](https://www.kff.org/medicare/state-indicator/total-medicare-beneficiaries/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D))  
  
[*Barack Obama,* a Democrat, passed the Affordable Care Act, the largest expansion of health care since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965,  covering more than 20,000,000 uninsured Americans, and even got a public option passed in the House.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act)  

That's not even including all the plans!  Want to talk about when [*Ted Kennedy,* a Democrat, and *John Dingell,* also a Democrat, proposed The Kennedy/Dingell Medicare for All Act of 2007?](https://www.politico.com/story/2007/04/the-time-is-now-medicare-for-all-003676)  Or [*Hillary Clinton's* health care plan of 1993?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_health_care_plan_of_1993)  Or [*Jimmy Carter's* attempts to find a unity health care plan with Edward Kennedy in 1977?](https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/171720)    

And I'm sure I don't need to tell you that *Joe Biden,* yes *Joe hurter of God Biden*,*also* is a Democrat and [*also has a plan for comprehensive universal health care!*](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/)    

Democrats don't care about your health care?  We've been fighting this battle for nearly a century now, and every time we take a step forward there are Republicans right there trying to get in our way and drag us back, underfunding Medicare and Medicaid, trying to privatize social security, making complex and convoluted rules to undo our work.  Do you remember [in 2012 when Paul Ryan tried to replace Medicare with *vouchers?*](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2011/04/05/you-put-the-load-right-on-me)  When [George W. Bush tried to make it harder to sue for malpractice in 2005?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC545016/)  All the counterproductive tax breaks that needed to be retroactively made deficit neutral?  For the last three quarters of a century Democrats have been fighting to protect and expand health care, always with the ultimate goal of achieving universal coverage, but we don't have universal power to get our policies passed.     
  
I get it, political memory is short and gross (not disgusting gross, the other kind), but come the fuck on already.  Show me any other major American political party that has accomplished and tried to accomplish as much positive change in our healthcare system as the Democratic party has.  You point to the Affordable Care Act as a failure?  I think it's a fucking architectural masterpiece that it's even *still standing* after what Republicans have done and tried to do to it.  
  
If you want Democrats to stop failing at health care, do you know what the solution is?  *Send more Democrats.*  Send so many Democrats that the party doesn't need to nuke the filibuster, doesn't need to bargain with Republicans, doesn't need to cut deals with Independents, so that they can just pass the damn laws.  Give us 67 seats in the Senate, 292 seats in the House, a butt in the Oval Office, and six liberals on the Supreme Court and we'll get so much goddamn work done so fast your head will spin.  You want health care?  With a Congress like that we'd probably end up with a UBI.  The problem isn't the Democrats, the problem is the Republicans who obstruct and deconstruct every piece of legislation that we try to pass, they're the kids kicking the sand castle, and you're berating the sculptor for not building fast enough.",2020-08-07T17:58:41+00:00

If he is suggesting that the government provide that financing, or pay for those services, then it is just a single payer system with middlemen taking a cut. 

>“That comes from the federal government stepping up and dealing with concerns that they have,” Biden said. “The reimbursement they are going to get, how they’re going to be able to move forward.”

If there is a government plan for reimbursement, even if its only during extreme circumstances, this would more efficiently be done by a government run insurance (eg single payer) rather than trying to negotiate and pass this stuff adhoc when energy would be better directed dealing with the actual crisis.

This is very high, particularly considering the current level of polarization. There really isn't another topic that is this popular with Americans, particularly one as salient as health care. MFA, on the other hand, polls in the 40% region. A cut of 30% in popularity simply will make people less likely to vote for you. It won't cause a complete collapse of the Democrats, but marginal races like the presidency will be in jeopardy.

2. It's politically untenable. In order to pass, any health care bill will need support of some amount of Republican senators. This is simply a reality of the Senate with it's current make up. Going back to the polls, the public option polls in the mid 40% range among Republicans, where as MFA is around 15%. This means that Republican senators in purplish-red states could be incentivized to support a public option or face backlash. Opposing MFA would not only help them among their base, but with independents as well, and would be a smart political move. 

3. It is expensive. MFA is more (govermentally) expensive then a public option. That money will have to come from increases in taxes, and it will be difficult to not raise taxes on the middle class. Any tax increase is likely to be poorly received by the public, particularly anything on the middle class. Warren's plan shows this with its contortions to avoid middle class taxes, but is far too optimistic in its estimates, they are far higher or lower than other studies as is convenient, has fundamental misunderstandings, health care costs will always outpace GDP because of the Baumol effect, and bad policies, transaction fees destroyed the Swedish stock exchange in the 80s and that was before high frequency trading was really a thing.

4. It's no better than a public option. It could be argued that these downsides would be worth it if MFA was truly the best option we have, but this is not clearly the case.

- lower the corporate income tax rate
- taxing capital gains as ordinary income, with both maybe having a marginal top rate of around 30%
- make the payroll tax proportional to all wages, eliminating the maximum taxable wage base
- eliminate itemized deductions, but expand the child tax credit
- switch welfare to a NIT-like system
- minimize occupational licensing, zoning laws, CON laws, and visa delays
- ban non-compete agreements between employers and employees
- index the minimum wage to half of the median hourly wage (so currently around $12-$13/hour)
- ban right-to-work laws
- eliminate unnecessary review on Asian biotech investment (just why did Trump do this; half of biotech investment comes from Asia)
- reinstate net neutrality
- possibly privatize airports
- repeal all trade barriers and “Made in America” requirements, scrap the Jones Act
- basically open borders
- 12 weeks of paid family leave
- all-payer healthcare using capitation and global budgeting
- carbon tax of ~$100/tonne
- allow pipelines, but probably disallow drilling on federal land
- institute a statute of limitations for NEPA cases
- establish national testing standards by grade
- make public colleges not free but instead transition to an income-contingent repayment plan
- against race-conscious admissions
- pro-choice
- in favor of universal background checks and gun licensing
- decriminalize drugs, instead mandating rehab
- eliminate private prisons
- automatically put Americans on the voter rolls once 18 y/o, reduce barriers to voting, establish independent commissions to determine districts

P.S. Is there a way to make US ports automate without union busting? I think unions are a net positive but I do think sometimes they do not act in the public’s best interest. Thanks! Also, I’m not a policy wonk, so if I’m uninformed please let me know!",2022-10-30T01:51:32+00:00

How awful is it that a Green has to forego his or her party affiliation in order to ease ballot access somewhat?  The right to vote is not only a right to vote for a Republican or a Democrat, but a right to vote for the candidate of your choice. Ballot access laws should not discriminate!

Meanwhile, let's remember US Senator Susan Collins role in Obamacare.  She pretended to be willing to vote for the Affordable Care Care provided that the ACA included her modifications. She then modified the bill to make it (even) more palatable to Republicans.  And then voted against it!

She doesn't believe that a sitting President's perjuring himself should be grounds for removal from office. She can't seem to decide whether or not net neutrality harms the US economy.  She likes corporate tax cuts. More:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Collins#Senate_career

Lisa Savage is running against four Democrats and a couple of other indies in a ranked voting state.

The most encouraging thing, though, were all of the voters who wanted to sign for us, but had good reasons for not being able to. They wanted to vote for Bernie, or they valued their unenrolled status - now, in just a couple of days since the switch, we're averaging more than 30 signatures an hour! 

Super Tuesday will be a big event for us - we have nearly 100 volunteers fanning out to polling places around the state. Can we get 4,000 signatures in one day? We think it's possible.

GreenParty,post,Single-payer system,19b76tn,darinrobbins,Green Party Releases Its Progressive Agenda Ahead of Hochul’s State of the State,"**Green Party Releases Its Progressive Agenda Ahead of Hochul’s State of the State** 

1/9/24 - The Green Party of New York said that Governor Hochul’s State of the State failed to lay out the bold action needed to deal with the multiple crisis facing New York. “The Governor remains more committed to protecting her campaign donors rather than making the investments needed to lift up the average New Yorkers, many of whom continue to face significant economic challenges following the COVID epidemic. Threats to democracy and to the well-being of the average New Yorkers remains a bipartisan effort,” said Peter LaVenia, co-chair of the Green Party.

The Greens released its progressive agenda for 2024, including ballot access reform to restore third party political rights, enacting Ranked Choice Voting and proportional representation, passing single-payer universal healthcare, and needed housing reforms including rent control, constructing a million units of publicly owned social housing, and good-cause eviction. The party argued for immediate action on climate change, and said that taxing the rich, including stopping the rebate of the Stock Transfer Tax, would help pay for needed reforms and social program expansion including reinvestment in impacted communities.

While the Party was encouraged that the Governor is proposing at least part of the NY Heat Act to curtail the promotion of and subsidies for fossil fuels, they criticized the Hochul administration for failing to meet the deadlines laid out in the state's new climate law on how it plans to meet its relatively weak goals to reduce global emissions. According to a recent report by Dr. James Hansen, the world will have already passed the target of 1.5 degrees C warming before NY even adopts its legally required plan on how to reduce emissions. “No wonder the UN has said that governments' slow climate action has opened up the Gates of Hell. And delaying Hochul’s weak carbon pricing plan just allows more fuel to be thrown into the fire,” noted Mark Dunlea of the EcoAction Committee of the U.S. Green Party.

Hochul did lay out a number of small but important climate steps, but fell far short of treating the situation as a climate emergency. Noticeably absent was any mention the Hochul intended to have NYPA launched a major expansion of publicly owned renewable energy as authorized in last year’s budget, nor was there any mention of public ownership of the transmission grid. While Hochul has indicated that $3 billion a year will be raised by how delayed cap-and-trade program, her speech fell far short on outlining a plan to begin investing the $10 to $20 billion of annual funding needed for a rapid transition to clean energy. She did announce support for making polluters to pay for the damages they have caused, such as enacting the Climate Superfund Act. The Party wished that her Solar for All was actually for all residents. It also supports far greater funding for environmental justice and Just Transition programs.

“The climate emergency is at a crucial point. We must solve the climate crisis so that our children have a chance for a decent future. The Green New Deal, which we first called for in Howie Hawkins’ 2010 gubernatorial race, will also meet the economic needs of our state’s residents. Single payer health care would reduce overall healthcare spending while ensuring that everyone’s health care needs, including COVID, are met,” added Dunlea. 

In addition to funding Green New Deal initiatives, the Greens call for an ecosocialist Green New Deal to move rapidly towards a renewable energy economy. The party said it strongly opposes Gov. Hochul’s cap-and-trade solution and that the CLCPA was an example of the Democrat’s tepid response to the worsening climate catastrophe. They called for major subsidies to enact rapid decarbonization of all buildings in the state including heat pumps, geothermal, and energy conservation. Greens called for a rapid expansion of funds for mass transit and that all new vehicles should be electric by 2030.  The Greens want a target date of zero emissions as soon as possible (2030), rather than the 30-year goal under the state law, which would still allow emissions to be 15% of 1990 levels. The Greens back an immediate halt to all new fossil fuel infrastructure, increased public ownership and democratic control of the energy system and a robust carbon tax in all sectors to make polluters pay for the damages they cause with fossil fuels.

The Greens said that New York State must become a gold standard for electoral reform. They mentioned that New York is an outlier in recent years, as most states have loosened ballot access laws rather than restricting them. Reform of ballot access laws would give New Yorkers more choices and help combat the widespread and continual corruption in state government from both the Democrats and Republicans.

“Democracy continues to be in a fragile condition in New York and nationwide, with both parties engaged in corruption and suppression of democratic rights. Cuomo used the cover of COVID to kill independent small parties in the state budget. We demand the so-called progressive Democrats with a Legislative supermajority who told us they opposed what was happening to have the courage to stand up and do what is right for New Yorkers. That includes raising the taxes on billionaires and other rich New Yorkers to close the massive budget deficit from COVID,” said  Gloria Mattera, state party co-chair.

“Governor Hochul’s attempt to legalize Accessory Dwelling Units and force municipalities to build housing hit a roadblock last year because it was dependent on *private* *property* interests doing so. As a party we agree that housing reform is absolutely necessary, but the only way to get there is through *public investment and ownership* of housing. We need a committed program of *public social housing* that provides a million units for working-class and middle-class families across the state. Additionally, we need to pass strong tenant protection like rent control, good-cause eviction, and legalizing Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) to shift away from the bankrupt suburban, single-family home model,” added Mattera.

The Greens have also been long-term proponents of stopping the multi-billion dollar annual rebate of the Stock Transfer Tax. “It is long past time we make the rich pay their fair share of taxes, instead of making New York the long-time leader in economic inequality. We won’t solve the climate crisis or systemic racism or a host of other social problems until we embrace ecosocialism, putting the needs of average people and the planet ahead of the profits and well-being of a few,” said Peter LaVenia, state party co-chair.",2024-01-20T08:28:35+00:00

GreenParty,post,Single-payer system,1qgctb,greenpartyoffice,Suggestions for revising the health care section of the Green Party platform?,"OTHER THAN the removal of homeopathy?


""F. Health Care

The Green Party supports single-payer universal health care and preventive care for all. We believe that health care is a right, not a privilege.

Our current health care system lets tens of thousands of people die each year by excluding them from adequate care, while its exorbitant costs are crippling our economy. The United States is the only industrialized nation in the world without a national health care system.

Under a universal, comprehensive, national single-payer health care system, the administrative waste of private insurance corporations would be redirected to patient care. If the United States were to shift to a system of universal coverage and a single payer plan, as in Canada and many European countries, the savings in administrative costs would be more than enough to offset the cost of additional care. Expenses for businesses currently providing coverage would be reduced, while state and local governments would pay less because they would receive reimbursement for services provided to the previously unin­sured, and because public programs would cease to be the ""dumping ground"" for high-risk patients and those rejected by health maintenance organizations (HMOs) when they become disabled and unemployed. In addition, people would gain the peace of mind in knowing that they have health care they need. No longer would people have to worry about the prospect of financial ruin if they become seriously ill, are laid off their jobs, or are injured in an accident.

Greens support a wide-range of health care services, not just traditional medicine which too often emphasizes ""a medical arms race"" that relies upon high-tech intervention, surgical techniques and costly pharmaceuticals. Chronic conditions are often best cured by alternative medicine. We support the teaching, funding and practice of holistic health approaches and as appropriate, the use of complementary and alternative therapies such as herbal medicines, homeopathy, naturopathy, traditional Chinese medicine and other healing approaches.

Greens recognize that our own health is also intimately tied to the health of our communities and environment. To improve our own health, we must improve the quality of our air, water and food and the health of our workplaces, homes and schools.

The Green Party unequivocally supports a woman's right to reproductive choice, no matter her marital status or age, and that contraception and safe, legal abortion procedures be available on demand and be included in all health insurance coverage in the U.S., as well as free of charge in any state where a woman's income falls below the poverty level. [See section A.1. Women's Rights in this chapter]

We recommend the following actions:

1. Single-Payer Health Care

Enact a universal, comprehensive, national single-payer health plan that will provide the following with no increase in cost:

a. A publicly funded health care insurance program, administered at the state and local levels, with comprehensive lifetime benefits, including dental, vision, mental health care, substance abuse treatment, medication coverage, and hospice and long-term care;

b. Participation of all licensed and/or certified health pro­viders, subject to standards of practice in their field, with the freedom of patients to choose the type of health care provider from a wide range of health care choices, and with decision-making in the hands of patients and their health providers, not insurance companies;

c. Portability of coverage regardless of geographical location or employment;

d. Cost controls via streamlined administration, national fee schedules, bulk purchases of drugs and medical equipment, coordination of capital expenditures and publicly negotiated prices of medications;

e. Primary and preventive care as priorities, including wellness education about diet, nutrition and exercise; Holistic health including homeopathy, naturopathic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, herbalism and medical marijuana;

f. More comprehensive services for those who have special needs, including the mentally ill, the differently abled and those who are terminally ill;

g. A mental health care system that safeguards human dignity, respects individual autonomy, and protects informed consent;

h. Greatly reduced paperwork for both patients and pro­viders;

i. Fair and full reimbursement to providers for their services;

j. Hospitals that can afford safe and adequate staffing levels of registered nurses;

k. Establishment of national, state, and local health policy boards consisting of health consumers and providers to oversee and evaluate the performance of the system, ensure access to care, and help determine research priorities; and

l. Establishment of a National Health Trust Fund that would channel all current Federal payments for health care programs directly into the Fund, in addition to employees' health premium payments.

2. AIDS / HIV

The Green Party calls for comprehensive, humane, and competent care of all people with AIDS/HIV.

An all-out campaign must be waged against AIDS/ HIV and other blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis. The AIDS epidemic has not been adequately addressed at the local, state, federal, or international levels. All people in all countries, including those with AIDS/HIV, have a right to medical care, protection from discrimination, and confidentiality.

Drug corporations have a strong profit motivation to make this disease a manageable one (like diabetes) with guaranteed sales of very expensive drugs, in the billions of dollars every year. Drug companies have not emphasized research that targets a cure. While new drugs have dramatically saved lives, many have side effects so debilitating that the quality of life is poor, if not intolerable during the extended lifetime of the patient. But even these need to be produced generically to stop the devastation resulting from corporate refusal to provide these drugs to the millions dying throughout the world who cannot afford these basic lifesaving drugs. Drug researchers should have a cure for AIDS as their ultimate goal.

We recommend the following actions:

a. Increased funding for AIDS education and patient care.

b. Increased funding for comprehensive sex education that includes AIDS education.

c. Increased funding for research focusing on a cure, methods of prevention, and on bolstering the immune system.

d. Improved technology, facilities, laboratories, researchers, staff and personnel to cure AIDS/HIV. A ""Manhattan Project"" for a cure is required.

e. Complete sharing of information among researchers, funding agencies (including corporations), and the public on AIDS/HIV before awarding the next research grant.

f. More research into better methods of prevention of HIV infection. While we support condom use, better condoms are also required. We support more vaccine research as well as research on prevention methods such as microbicides. People must be provided the means and support to protect themselves from all sexually transmitted diseases.

g. Equal access to AIDS education, treatment and medications for all affected. Accordingly, funding and accountability should be increased.

h. Allowing all prisoners affected with AIDS/HIV in all countries to have the same access as free citizens to education, treatment, preventive measures (including condom use), and medical care.

i. A uniform international definition of AIDS.

j. Protecting the confidentiality of all people diagnosed with AIDS/HIV or tested for HIV.

k. More careful and timely approval of effective AIDS drugs by the FDA.

l. Production of affordable and available versions of patented medicines in all countries.

m. Targeting the young for age-appropriate education about AIDS/HIV and appropriate methods of prevention. We support sex education and the distribution of condoms in schools.

n. Prevention awareness and access to condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS. We condemn HIV-related discrimination.

o. Make drug treatment and other programs available for all addicts who seek help.

p. Expand clinical trials for treatments and vaccines.

q. Speed-up the FDA drug approval process.

r. Providing housing for homeless and poor people with AIDS/HIV.

s. Providing treatment for homeless people with AIDS/ HIV.

t. Support for needle exchange programs and for programs to help drug addicts.

u. No mandatory screening for AIDS/HIV; anonymous screening must be available.

v. Lifting the ban prohibiting HIV positive people from entering the U.S. as visitors or as immigrants.""",2013-11-12T13:37:18+00:00

GreenParty,post,Single-payer system,ic84r9,majnuker,What do you see as the key future policies of the Green Party?,"We're witnessing what could be the capitulation of the Conservative party in the United States. Recovering from the past four years will take a significant platform shift, and Libertarians are more likely to fill that need for fiscal conservatism. 

Which leaves the Green Party as the likely third or fourth most well represented aspect of our Democracy. 

**So my challenge to you all is: what do you see as the key, most easily campaign-able policies for Green Party candidates of the future?** Realize this means you need to have a wide appeal on a fundamental level, a clear cause to get behind, and a real possibility of success. 

Personally, I see the Green Party being centered around its classic social reforms, around better representation in government, more capitalist regulation, and of course better environmental policies and increased funding for green energy solutions. More of a democratic socialist platform, perhaps with a keener focus on international relations and the importance of environmental health. This could be a very successful platform, as we see new green energy initiatives and the onset of serious climate repurcussions. Partial de-militarization could also be a cost saving measure for the government to fund new policies, and a key focus on new technology could support the rhetoric here (think drones, less boots on the ground, electronic countermeasures etc.). A universal basic income would also be important, along with student loan forgiveness (perhaps with terms), and a single-payer or public healthcare system.

Thoughts?

&#x200B;

I came here because I've been seeing r/libertarian popping up all the time, but I disagree with most of their policies. Some seem outlandish at best. It seems there is a need for a third option. 

But I also feel the Democrats are too moderate in many areas, and a counterbalance to conservatism and moderatism is needed. Bernie was close, but maybe we should look outside the Democrats for the truly progressive policies, such as the ones Andrew Yang espoused during his presidential campaign.

These are just some thoughts. Obviously, the potential, while there, will have to wait until we save ourselves from the collapse of our democracy. After that, though, I think dissatisfaction with Democrats will only grow, and a need for a truly humanity-centered party will be needed.

&#x200B;

And I don't consider Marianne Willamson a possible candidate ever. The lady was clearly out of her realm on that one, too soft, in a dark world, to be a leader who could stand up to evil. But Al Gore? Bernie? Yang? Yea, they're pretty close. We need speed, resilience, and intelligence. The next decade will be more important than most!",2020-08-18T19:42:58+00:00

It's behind a paywall, but if you subscribe to the NY Times, I recommend the read because they layout nicely where different interest groups stand with the various proposals. It's not a united front of opposition because different groups benefit from different scenarios of medicare expansion.

Just a few of my take aways:

* The new coalition started with the hospital federation and two powerful lobbies, America’s Health Insurance Plans and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, last June and has since added more than 25 members, including the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and the nation’s Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans 
* The coalition, the [Partnership for America’s Health Care Future](https://americashealthcarefuture.org/), and its executive  director, [Lauren Crawford Shaver](http://forbes-tate.com/author/lshaver/page/2/), who led Mrs. Clinton’s efforts in 2016 to put marginal states into play, is already gearing up to fight medicare-for-all
* The group (not a lobbying organization, yet) plans to fight legislation to allow individuals between the ages of 50 and 65 buy into medicare
* The group does want to expand Medicaid in states that did not adopt the Medicaid expansion
*  The American College of Physicians, the largest medical specialty organization in the country, has supported a Medicare buy-in for people 55 to 64. ",2019-02-24T20:19:12+00:00

Lisa Savage is no longer running as a Green Party candidate due to state rules barring her from the ballot; however she's still a member & will increase their chances dramatically if she wins. 

We need this as part of major reform, but there's little effort to draw attention to this solution by establishment so we need to do what we can at grassroots level to expose epidemic fraud! 

Betsy Sweet is also running against Sara Gideon in the Democratic Party, I would prefer Lisa over her in the General; however the most important thing is to elect a progressive & she's far better than Gideon supporting Medicare for All & Green New Deal. 

Both of them would be far better than duopoly, and RCV may give them their best chance.

**Women's History Month** is a time to honor and celebrate our sheroes. The [**Green Party**](https://www.gp.org/) has many strong women leaders. Three of those women left a legacy of leadership in the party with their passing in 2018.

We celebrate and remember their lives and their roles in making our world a better place.

**Annie Young**, a member of the Green Party of Minnesota, was a strong advocate for environmental sustainability, social and economic justice, grassroots democracy and peace. She was elected to the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board and was well-respected as a an elected official. Annie advised and mentored candidates for office at all levels during her career in politics. She was known to have a reputation for bluntness but also effectiveness in her 28 years in office. Annie is fondly remembered for not only believing and advocating for Green values but for living Green values through her commitment to making our world a better place to live.

**Morgen D'Arc** was a longtime delegate to the Green Party of the United States for the Maine Independent Green Party, and once ran as a Green for Cumberland County register of probate. She was a co-founder of the Green Party National Women's Caucus and was a fierce defender of women’s rights in the other offices in which she served. She also helped launch and contributed to the Green Horizon Magazine. Morgen is fondly remembered as a leading force in growing the Green Party, both in her state and nationally.

**Claudia Ellquist** was a long-time member of the Arizona Green Party and the National Women’s Caucus (NWC). Her dedication to building a better world was an inspiration to many Greens from around the country. Claudia ran for Pima County Attorney four times in order to highlight the elimination of the death penalty as a public issue. She organized NOW chapters at the city, county, and state levels and served on the national board of directors for the organization. She was an original member of the Arizona Clean Elections Commission, first appointed by the Arizona Legislature in 1999. Claudia subsequently organized volunteer efforts to pass Healthy Arizona I (Prop 203) and Healthy Arizona II (Prop 204) which successfully brought Medicaid to the state after 30 years without it. Claudia was known for her strong leadership, analysis of issues, ability to listen to others, and genuine caring for all life.

GreenParty,post,Medicaid,5mieq4,Weeznaz,How to Convince Conservatives to vote Green,"I write this in the hopes that I can participate more heavily in politics and that I can promote my idea for how to make sure the Republicans don't retain their current majorities in the house and senate come the 2018 mid term elections. For some context my dad is a lifelong Conservative and a majority of my family friends are Conservatives. As the Green party we not only need to energize the ""Millenial"" generation but we also need to diminish support in the Republican party. In my opinion there are many messages presented by Bernie Sanders that can be spoken through a Conservative frame. 

That may sound weird but in my opinion there are many traits of Conservatives share

1: They're VERY anti establishment at this point... hence Trump's victory. We need to keep track of all the pro establishment policies the Republicans and Democrats in government will enact. We need to constantly talk to people in local counties throughout 2017 so they are reminded on a constant basis how this government under Republicans is not working for the American people. 

2: Every conservative I have ever met loves guns. We need to let the American people know we believe in the second amendment, more importantly we will never suggest an ""assault rifle"" ban or a high magazine ban. Now a background check is a little more swallowable to Conservatives if framed right, hell I just talked to my Dad who was calling the guy who shot up Fort Lauderdale airport as a ""nutjob"". I think if you frame this as keeping weapons away from ""nutjobs"" like this and make that message clear they can respect where we are coming from. 

3: Most Conservatives say they're against ""big government"". Conservatives like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, they like roads that don't look like shit, they like food and water that's clean and safe, and if you look at detailed breakdown's of Obamacare Conservatives tend to like most of the provisions in it except for the part where we are at the mercy of the private market. Conservatives like certain elements of ""big government"", they just might not realize this. What Conservatives really hate is WASTED money. We need to frame this argument as effective vs an ineffective government. Make the argument about HOW and WHAT we spend money on, not exactly how ""big"" or ""small"" the government.

4: Talk about how we plan on introducing new legislation to restore the US trade policies to pre NAFTA times. This will really resonate with Americans in the Rustbelt, and it also ties back to us fighting the ""establishment"" which at this point Conservatives are fed up with. 

5: We need to frame the Green Technology Revolution as a HUGE job creator. 

6: We need to criticize the Republican party in Texas for letting private companies steal PRIVATE lands using Imminent Domain so pipelines could be built through them. Conservatives have had their land stolen by Republican policies, it's time we talked to them and showed them that we are never going to let that stand. Note, this same strategy can be applied to every state with unnecessary pipelines being built. 

7: HAMMER the Republicans for killing Net Neutrality and make sure the public knows what Net Neutrality was and why it was so important. Spoiler alert, the Trump administration is going to kill it... this is anti consumer. 

8: Tell the Government to stay out of our damn personal lives by no longer supporting the Drug War. Get us out of Prohibition 2.0 and let us make our own damn Freedom choices.

9: Talk about how the Drug War and the War on Terror are FAILURES and we need to stop wasting tax money on them... Conservatives hate wasting money. 

These are the biggest issues I can think of that I believe can be framed in such a way to convince Conservatives to vote Green without compromising great ideas, cough cough Neoliberalism. ",2017-01-07T04:01:02+00:00

**WASHINGTON —** Green Party leaders have expressed alarm upon learning the U.S. House legislation passed on March 13 addressing the COVID-19 pandemic fails to guarantee paid sick leave for roughly 80% of workers. Citing the government’s ineffectual response in the early days of the outbreak, the Green Party is concerned that economic barriers could prevent many workers from participating in “social distancing,” one of the most effective remaining tactics for protecting vulnerable segments of the population from infection.

""COVID-19 has exposed how poorly prepared the U.S. healthcare system is to handle an epidemic,” said Green Party National Co-Chair [**Margaret Flowers**](https://www.gp.org/dr_margaret_flowers), who also serves on the Board of Advisors to Physicians for a National Health Program.  “We've missed the window for containing the virus through screening, testing and monitoring infected people and their contacts — as they did in China, South Korea and other countries. And so we can expect millions of cases.” Flowers also warned that “getting ill in the United States carries the extra burden of potential financial ruin. We need to move to a National Improved Medicare for All health system and paid medical leave as rapidly as possible.""

The World Health Organizations (WHO) declared the outbreak a pandemic on March 11.  As of Sunday, March 15,over 3,000 cases, including over 60 fatalities, have been reported in the United States.  That number could rise exponentially unless swift, decisive measures are taken to limit the spread of COVID-19, but equally intensive measures must address the needs of millions who depend on food, childcare and income from institutions and business that will be impacted by quarantines. 

“When it comes to crises — be it climate destruction, the 2008 financial collapse or COVID-19 — our country tends to fixate on individual choices instead of collective systems of support,“ said Green Party National Co-Chair [**Gloria Mattera**](https://www.gp.org/gloria_mattera), who works in public health. “Of course anyone who has the option to work from home and order in their groceries should do so, but we must acknowledge those options come from a place of relative privilege — we can’t leave everyone else to simply fend for themselves.”

“Capitalism rewards greed and puts the accumulation of private wealth above all else. It will always regard the most vulnerable in our society as expendable,” added Mattera.

The federal relief package would provide [tens of billions of dollars for sick and family medical leave,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_2&itid=lk_inline_manual_2) [free virus testing, additional food aid and funds for Medicaid](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/coronavirus-news-live-updates.html?action=click&auth=login-email&login=email&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage#link-47cd8806) but Greens are concerned it prioritizes bailing out corporations while falling short on measures to extend unemployment benefits, sick and family medical leave, mortgage and other loan relief or forgiveness. 

“Greens call for a Real [**Green New Deal**](https://www.gp.org/green_new_deal),” said **Tina Rockett**, co-chair of the [**Green Party of Virginia**](https://www.vagreenparty.org/).  “Our plan goes beyond the transition to clean energy and includes ambitious investment in all public infrastructure — like Medicare For All and the Center For Disease Control and Prevention — so we are better prepared to protect the health, safety and well-being of everyone regardless of their individual economic means.”

In a [**statement released Friday**](https://www.gp.org/savage_outlines_covid_19_response_plan), March 13, independent Green U.S. Senate candidate from Maine [**Lisa Savage**](https://www.lisaformaine.org/)called on the federal government to partner with state governors to provide testing kits that can be deployed to every corner of the United States as quickly as possible; to enroll everyone without health insurance immediately in some kind of Medicare plan and provide treatment and testing without individual cost; and to pass emergency legislation that suspends rent and mortgage collection in quarantined and restricted areas and subsidizes companies manufacturing items that are essential to daily life.

Bold challenge for frightening times. I understand it. A public option right now is like civil unions. It will be kind of like a trial run, rather than the full deal.

We know single payer is the end game. I just don't think it can pass a republican house. They may be more willing to pass the public option to see just how receptive it is, and to start moving towards a full universal healthcare. 

A public option is the most realistic at the moment,  but if the  republicans really want to ""make america great again"" than univeral healthcare would cement them in the history books as a great achievement.  ",2017-03-29T10:36:07+00:00

Attention is one thing. Action is another. Do you have any evidence that even 100,000 calls and emails have changed a single vote in the past thirty or forty years?

Everyone but the insurers, PHRMA and big medical providers were ignored. By the summer of 2009, Obama, who had run on a strong public option being the ONLY way to control costs (true, if you rule out Medicare for All, as he had), was testily telling the ""left of the left"" that the public option was ""only a sliver.""

#SpyGate

Bo 'Nick' Zhao, a Chinese born Australian goes to ASIO telling them he's been offered a $1million from the Chinese Government to run as a Liberal Party candidate and then infiltrate the Australian Parliament as a Chinese Spy.

He then turns up dead in a Melbourne hotel room in March.

Enter Gladys Liu, the Liberal Candidate with a host of concerning connections to the Chinese Government who earns Liberal pre-selection thanks to miraculously raising a million dollars in donations.

Fairfax then discovered a photo of Liu at her home with Nick Zhao in the back ground.

Gladys is now the Liberal Member for Chisolm.

#SignGate

Liberal Candidates Gladys Liu and Josh Frydenberg both have Mandarin signs at polling booths in the colours of the Australian Electoral Commission branding telling Chinese citizens how to vote (by putting 1 next to the Liberal Candidate). There is no Liberal Party branding on the sign

Liberal officials admit in court that the signs were designed to convey the appearance of official electoral commission material.

When asked what he did in the role, Joyce explained that he sent his ""report"" in the form of multiple text messages to Morrison. When The Guardian submitted a Freedom Of Information request for these texts it was rejected on the grounds that Morrison was too busy to retrieve them.

The Coalition granted $30million to Foxtel, ostensibly to assist with ""sports coverage"" (whilst simultaneously slashing ABC funding).

After Angus Taylor personally intervened and met with then Environment Minsiter Josh Frydenberg about the investigation into his brother, the Government suddenly announced a review into the part of Commonwealth environment laws that specifically deals with endangered native grasses.

#SportsRorts

Over $100million in grants to sporting clubs were handed out according to a colour coded spreadsheet showing if the clubs were in marginal or potentially winnable electorates.

The Government overruled the recommendations of the Sports Commission 300 times, instead giving photo ops to LNP candidates just before the election.

The PM denied any involvement despite extensive email evidence showing his office was calling the shots.

#Robodebt

In 2016, the Government set up an automated debt recovery mechanism to recover welfare overpayments.

However the calculations used by the system were deeply flawed and demanded repayments from thousands who hadn't been overpaid a cent.

To make matters worse, the new process reversed the onus of proof on the recipient to prove they hadn't been overpaid.

Over 2000 Australians died after receiving Robodebt notices. A large (although unknown) number have been attributed to self harm.

In 2020, the Government finally admitted the system was flawed and paid back or forgave $1.2billion in debts.

#CovidCommissionGate

Morrison hand picks a Gas Company Chairman to run a ""Covid Commission"" to plan Australia's post-Covid economy.

He was paid $500k for 6 months work. He eventually recommends tax payers underwrite a ""gas led"" recovery. The shares for the company he works for rises 8%.

#FoxtelGate2

When Foxtel missed out a $100million pandemic rescue package, News Corp execs wrote directly to Coalition Ministers to complain and immediately received $17.5 in tax payer grants.

When the ABC requested copies of the communication under FOI, the Government refused stating that it would damage the relationship between the Sports Minister and the PM.

#SharmaShareGate

As the Government was deciding whether or not to bail out Virgin Airlines, MP Dave Sharma purchased shares in Virgin's biggest competitor, Qantas.

Months later, just before Morrison announced an agreement with CSL to make millions of doses of a Covid vaccine, Sharma just happened to have bought CSL shares.

#CormannGate

Mathias Cormann quits the Coalition with aspirations to become the OECD Secretary General.

Tax payers fund his $4,300 per hour Private Jet to fly him to and around Europe as well as 8 full time Government employees to assist him.

#ChristmasRort

For the 2nd year in a row, Scott Morrison, Josh Frydenberg, and Peter Dutton fly by private jet from Canberra to Sydney (and back) purely to attend Lachlan Murdoch's Christmas Party.

Tax payers fund the trip.

#PyneGate

Between August 2018 and May 2019, Defence Minister Christopher Pyne awarded over $98million in multiple contracts to defence contractor Elbit Systems.

In December 2020, the moment Pyne's 18 month lobbying exclusion had passed for former Ministers, Pyne's lobbying firm was hired by Elbit Systems for an unknown fee.

* *The Green Party of New Jersey Proudly Endorses Internationally Renowned Writer and Activist Chris Hedges for U.S. Congress in District 1*

**TRENTON, NJ** – The [**Green Party of New Jersey**](https://www.gpnj.org/) (GPNJ) is excited to announce its endorsement of internationally renowned journalist, author and activist [**Chris Hedges**](https://twitter.com/ChrisLynnHedges) as the GPNJ candidate for U.S. Congress in District 12. He challenges Rep. Bonnie Watson-Coleman (D), as well as the entire “political machine” that has control over most of New Jersey. (For information about the towns in District 12, [click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey%27s_12th_congressional_district).)

**Green Party of New Jersey**  
[www.gpnj.org](https://www.gpnj.org/)

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**  
May 27, 2020

**For more information contact:**  
Madelyn Hoffman, Chair of the Communications Committee, [hoffmanforussenate@gmail.com](mailto:hoffmanforussenate@gmail.com)  
Craig Cayetano, State Co-chair, [craigcayetano@gmail.com](mailto:craigcayetano@gmail.com)  
Tom Violett, Regional Organizing Director, Howie Hawkins 2020, [rd1@howiehawkins.us](mailto:rd1@howiehawkins.us)

“The addition of Chris Hedges to an already strong slate makes the Green Party’s presence in New Jersey’s elections this year one of the strongest ever and definitely the strongest since the 2016 elections and my involvement in the Green Party of NJ,” said **Barry Bendar**, Elections Committee. “I am excited about the opportunity for the Greens to raise our profile -- as well as to focus on issues in ways that neither the Democrats or Republicans will.”

In a questionnaire submitted to GPNJ’s Green Council, Mr. Hedges indicated that the priority issues of his campaign include: Confronting the accelerating ecocide, putting an end to reliance on fossil fuels, promoting the real Green New Deal and slashing of the military budget. Other issues include getting big money out of politics, opposing the continued creation of charter schools instead of strengthening public education, and promoting the need for a true single-payer health insurance program to replace what passes as health insurance in this country. The critical nature of this issue was made more visible during the COVID-19 crisis.

“I am excited about this opportunity to raise the visibility of the nation’s most critical issues to a new level,” said **Madelyn Hoffman**, GPNJ’s candidate for U.S. Senate in 2020. “Chris Hedges brings so much knowledge and experience to our campaigns. New Jersey voters will have the opportunity to vote for candidates providing a much-needed alternative to the corporate-dominated, pro-war and pro-rich Democrats and Republicans.”

**Craig Cayetano**, one of GPNJ’s State Co-Chairs said, “Having a voice such as Mr. Hedges who advocates on behalf of the working class and for an alternative party step up and into a Congressional race elevates the Green Party, not only in New Jersey, but nationally as well. There are many people unsure of where the Sanders movement belongs or goes after the primaries. I can assure them there is a home for progressive politics here in the Green Party of New Jersey.

“Chris Hedges has been a champion for democratic rights and civil liberties against mass incarceration, mass surveillance, and the suppression of dissent,” said **Howie Hawkins**, GPNJ endorsed candidate seeking Green Party United States (GPUS) nomination for president. “He has been a prophetic voice for socialist solutions to the pressing problems of climate, inequality, and nuclear arms. As Green Party candidate for Congress, he will be a compelling advocate for the positive changes we need.”

Chris Hedges joins the already declared slate of Green Party of New Jersey’s (GPNJ’s) candidates [**Madelyn Hoffman for U.S. Senate**](https://www.hoffmanforsenate.com/) and [**Craig Cayetano for Town Council in Hawthorne’s Ward 3**](https://www.cayetano4council.com/). The top of the ticket for the New Jersey Greens will be decided in July, when the Green Party US (GPUS) chooses its presidential nominee. GPNJ endorsed Howie Hawkins for President at its convention earlier this month with a resounding 79% of the vote. Howie Hawkins named **Angela Walker**, a Black Lives Matter Activist and Socialist Party USA Vice Presidential candidate in 2016 as his Vice-Presidential running mate for 2020.

""Young people are excited to support Chris Hedges and his campaign for Congress, because Chris Hedges has a long history of standing up on issues that are important to young people,” said **Matthew James Skolar**, Chair of the (Young Eco-socialists) YES Caucus of GPNJ. “Incumbent Congresswoman Bonnie Watson-Coleman, although not the worst of legislators from New Jersey, has not been clear on her stance when it comes to free, public higher education, supporting an environmentally sustainable future, or actively supporting the anti-war movement. Youth are excited to get behind someone who will be clear on these issues and so much more.""

The Green Party of New Jersey has been growing steadily since 2017 from 2,977 registered Greens then to 11,214 as of March 2020! This slate of candidates for 2020 should continue that trend upward into 2021. To read our platform, volunteer and donate please check us out at gpnj.org.

Our immediate focus is to help Mr. Hedges get on the ballot for November. People that reside in Congressional District 12 and have not signed another candidate’s petition for U.S. Congress in District 12, may sign for him at this link, [https://bit.ly/HedgesPetition](https://na2.documents.adobe.com/public/esignWidget?wid=CBFCIBAA3AAABLblqZhBx-TIxadkJ0QwZsX8Me2YLcHEgtKw56N7MxJypNbN8KR5m_Lxo6YCVxkeH-TECh00&fbclid=IwAR2OL_-tUpZTt8sLileUzpBDZIoC7GWpi0gBuCym5bP8KF1LFmCmftz_rVk).

There are 35 seats up for grabs, reinstated from 25 seats, and elected from 5 electorates each with 7 seats, using the proportional Hare-Clark variant of single transferable voting (or STV).

As of the [latest count by ABC News Australia](https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/tas/2024/results), the Tasmanian Greens, led by Rosalie Woodruff, will win 2 seats. Rockliff's Liberals will be the largest party, right now at 12 seats (with 2 more likely seats), and the Labor Party, led by Rebecca White, at 10. According to the ABC, the Greens are also likely to pick up 2 more seats (for up to 4), as well as 3 likely seats for the populist Jacqui Lambie Network, and 4 independents

It is looking like no party will win a majority, thus either a coalition or confidence agreement is needed, and right now the Greens will share the balance of power with JLN and the independents.

Government is about half the health insurance market with Medicare, Medicaid and the VA. This is why the health insurance market is not functioning like a normal market in any other industry.

Get government out of the health insurance business as much as possible. Limit them to limited regulation and financial support for health insurance to those who need it.

Obamacare, Medicaid, Medicare and VA hospitals should be phased out. People under these programs and those who are financially below the poverty level should be given a yearly amount that they could use to purchase health insurance.

Keep the federal regulation stating that insurance companies have to cover pre-existing conditions as long as the person had previous insurance.
Allow people to purchase insurance from any state. Deregulate state health insurance markets. Unhinge medical insurance from employers in the tax code.

Getting government out and increasing competition in this way will lower health insurance costs. It cuts the bureaucracy costs, cuts the fraud costs and improves competition and quality of care.

In fairness to now Justice Kagan, I find it difficult to believe that the Solicitor-General takes a position before the SCOTUS that the POTUS does not support. 

The dembot excuse at the time was the the SG was supporting the FDA.  However, Monsanto had skipped the EPA. So, the SG could just have easily have argued on behalf of EPA compliance as on behalf of the FDA. All of which begs the question why the FDA allowed Monsanto to skip EPA compliance in the first place.  

Maybe Trump's wall will help keep Mexican crops from contamination by Monsanto's frankenseeds?  (It won't do much else, but cost taxpayers money.)

[**IVN**](https://ivn.us/2019/03/19/betrayed-outraged-win-rural-vote-today-political-climate/)  
**by Dr. Lynn S. Kahn**  
**March 19, 2019**

Let’s just call everything outside major urban centers, the rural vote. Betrayed by politicians of every political party, left out of every agriculture-related policy decision in every government agency, on the short end of every economic development strategy at all levels of government, the rural vote is changing. Still broken and outraged, a newly energized coalition now demands integrity in elections and true representation for the people of rural and small town economies.

You want that vote? Start here.

### 1: Do Your Homework

Understand the basic issues from the point of view of family-owned, small and medium-sized farms and ranches, along with the small businesses that form the economic core of our rural counties and districts. It’s not a pretty picture, with ignorant government policies in the background, the contamination and degradation of our food and water systems throughout, and “Big Money” driving working farmers and ranchers out of business so land, livestock, and water can be bought on the cheap.

If you want the rural vote, [**learn**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/09/american-food-giants-swallow-the-family-farms-iowa) about the issues, [**listen**](https://democracychronicles.org/voices-of-our-farmers/) deeply to working farmers, and bring well considered and courageous solutions to the crisis that is destroying rural America and endangering our nation’s food supply. Dairy farmers are a microcosm of that destruction with economic, environmental, health, nutritional, food supply, immigration, the humane treatment of livestock, poverty and social justice issues all interconnected.

In the early 1970s, America had about 600,000 traditional dairy farms. Now we have about 40,000. Over those decades, milk production has **not** fallen and is in fact **rising** along with the unsustainable growth of mega-farms where livestock in the tens of thousands are fenced in with little room to move. The consolidation of farms and ranches is enabled by federal agriculture policies that favor “bigger is better” and the same dynamics play out in the fishing, grain, and crop industries.

In the dairy industry, government policies set the price of milk below the farmer’s cost to produce that milk. The farmer’s cost is about $21.59 and they receive less than $18 and sometimes less than $14 per hundred pounds of milk (called hundredweight). Government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), manipulate the formula that undervalues the farmer’s cost of production while the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) manipulates the definition of milk, meat and fish.

Dairy farmers cannot climb out of the hole our government has thrown them in, especially while other federal policies restrict local banks from providing debt relief. Once the milk is produced, major milk processors and dairy co-ops establish practices and set so-called “market adjustment fees” knowing full well that low prices and excessive fees will put the squeeze on the small and medium farmers.

False advertising and misleading food labels confuse consumers and silence farmers who believe our government should be serving *We, the People*, not lining the pockets of industrial agriculture.

The 2014 and 2018 Farm Bills are simply “bipartisan” weapons to eradicate an entire class of working farmers and destroy the economies of small towns. The so called “safety net” promises everything, yet saves no one. International trade agreements immorally and unconstitutionally interfere with the ability of nations around the world to independently and safely produce food.

With the farmer losing money to so many middlemen, the consumers are overcharged for food and produce that is quickly becoming less and less nutritious.

### 2: Food is Medicine 

The concerns of family-owned farming, ranching and fishing operations go beyond unnerving questions about their ability to survive and extend to the ways we are losing control of our local food supply and replacing wholesome, nutritious food with chemical experiments. The impact of chemically-enhanced food is not evaluated or regulated, and many believe this contributes to rising rates of obesity, malnutrition, allergies, cancers, digestive, and auto-immune diseases.

Our small farmers and local food producers see this unfold as government policies drive them out of business while mass producing and mass marketing fake milk, fake meat, and fake fish.

Perhaps the best example is the extensive use of Milk Protein Concentrate (MPC) – the dehydrated, heat-processed, ultra-filtered, chemically-enhanced, easily transported “milk” product with a long shelf life that many dairy farmers call “moo-glue” and now finds its way into far too many foods. Slimy-tasting, individually wrapped “cheese” slices are MPC. That strange looking oil often seen on top of some of your pizza screams MPC.

USDA regulations allow manufacturers to hide the use of MPC and refer to it as “milk” in lists of ingredients. The labels are simply not honest. So MPC goes into packaged mac and cheese, yogurt, cream cheese, ice cream and possibly even candies.

We do not know how much wholesome, farm fresh milk that traditionally went into dairy products is now displaced with MPC — some say at least 10% and maybe 30% or more. With big business now paying agriculture schools to research nano- and micro-filtration, no end is in sight and no oversight exists for “innovations” of milk protein.

And no government agency investigates or sets standards for the chemical burden and health impact of fake food. We have no idea if milk protein derivatives are equal in nutritional safety and economic valuation to traditional dairy ingredients that were historically and directly derived from milk itself.

### 3: United, We May Survive

We all eat. There is no rural-urban divide. There is a flow of rural resources including food and water into urban centers and a similar flow of investment options and new technologies from urban cores to rural counties. We are one America. Our farmers and ranchers nourish us, while government policies and the corrupting influence of Big Money have betrayed them and endanger the quality of our food and the health of our families and children.

Yes, it’s complicated and urgent. Our national wellbeing depends on courage from political leaders. Only one current federal candidate seems to understand what is needed. [**Marc Friedenberg**](https://marcforpa.com/), candidate for Congress in Pennsylvania’s 12th District, concluded in a February 19, 2019 letter to Farm Women United that he sees the  “deepening, severe economic emergency the dairy farmers and rural communities are facing.”

He stands for action on at least the following:

1. Set an emergency floor price of $20 per hundred weight for farm milk
2. Implement long-term corrections in the methods used to price farmers’ milk which must accurately reflect the cost of production
3. Investigate corruption in the co-op system
4. Investigate the role that milk protein concentrate (MPC) plays in undermining the consumer retail milk and dairy product market
5. Explore the role that Dodd-Frank regulations may play in freezing the credit market for dairy farmers.

**Final Comments:** We have run out of time. Farmers have always adapted — to changing weather, changing food trends, new insect infestations, even lightning strikes that set barns on fire or kill cattle. They cannot adapt and will no longer accept a federal government that sells out food producers and consumers to corporations that lie, cheat, and destroy our natural environment.

As Brenda Cochran, President of Farm Women United describes:

*We produce the food, we pay the bills, we create the wealth that supposed to circulate beyond our farms, but rural New York, Pennsylvania and elsewhere look like Europe after World War II. We are dying and we see the corruption, we see the manipulations, and worst of all we now see the fake food that industrial agriculture and mass advertising put on people’s plates. It’s not about economics, it’s about government policies that are driving family farmers and ranchers bankrupt. For the consumer and farmer, our food supply is being corporatized, globalized, industrialized and politicized.*

Rural communities and dairy farmers in particular are now joining together to demand justice for farmers and integrity for consumers and citizens. Will candidates and independent political parties rise to the challenge?

I don’t know what the answer is, but I do know that people need help. The current system is designed for the working class to fail and bicker amongst ourselves while the 1% get richer.  

Maybe subsides and incentives is a better approach. Zero interest long term loans designed to pay off outrageous credit card debt. Universal health care. Housing vouchers. Revamp of EBT cards. Affordable childcare and funding a real education system that pays teachers adequate wages. Stopping corporations and foreign investors from scooping up real estate. 

There are so many other systems in this country that need to be fixed. I just think it makes sense to address those first before taking on this behemoth, because there’s little doubt the current concept won’t makes this stupid inflation even worse.",2024-03-07T02:54:17+00:00

**Mobile Bay, Alabama –** A woman's right to bodily autonomy is not to be trifled with. These regressive laws being passed by our out of touch state government to restrict women's rights will not go by without hearing our voices!

Sexism and women's oppression are blights on our society that go deep. We are seeing them institutionalized in front of our very eyes. We show that SOLIDARITY is stronger than their repressive attacks on women! Women are not second class citizens!

[**Rally hosted by the Mobile Bay Green Party**](https://www.facebook.com/MobileBayGreens/)  
**Bienville Square, 150 Dauphin Street, Mobile, Alabama**  
**Sunday, May 19**  
**Noon – 3 p.m. CDT**

We must demand the right to reproductive healthcare, including abortion, as well as the right to have a child without the burden of enormous childcare costs – this means demanding free, universal childcare.

Our movements can’t wait for the Democratic Party or the mainstream women’s organizations to become the leadership we need. Defeating backwards anti-choice legislation will require a determined struggle from below. Beyond defensive battles, we must organize for an end to for-profit healthcare, and for a Medicare for All system including free, legal, and accessible abortion. We can fight to win a federal $15 minimum wage and high-quality social housing, which is the bare minimum necessary for working class families!

There will be speakers and a march through downtown.

Stand with us all, Sunday! If you can't make it, STAY TUNED! This isn't the end.

Bring your best protest signs and your friends!

GreenParty,comment,big pharma,d74pzgg,kratomgoodbanbad,,"I don't know if any of you have seen this, but yesterday the DEA moved to make kratom a Schedule I substance. Kratom is a plant that has been used for hundreds of years. Many people see it as a natural treatment for opioid addiction and other health problems. There have been no recorded deaths caused by kratom in the U.S. and it does not cause respiratory depression (that's what causes pharmaceutical pain killers to kill people when they overdose); scientists are exploring it as a possible safe treatment for the opioid addiction epidemic in this country.

And the DEA, with no research or justification, says it wants to make kratom a Schedule I substance! That's the same level as heroin, meth and crack cocaine (of course Big Pharma's pain killers aren't even listed as Schedule I). If kratom is schedule I, researchers won't even be able to study the possible therapeutic benefits of kratom. People will be thrown in jail for drinking a tea.

This seems like the perfect issue for Jill to speak out against. It relates to Big Pharma corrupting government, the war on drugs, and mass incarceration. I hope Jill can speak out against this and we can spread more information about the DEA's decision, this has the potential to ruin people's lives!

GreenParty,comment,big pharma,d76jfz6,kratomgoodbanbad,,"This disproves nothing I've said. There's no 'conspiracy theory'

Can kratom be addictive if taken everyday? Yes. So can dip and chewing tobacco. But we wouldn't ban skoal and throw people in jail for using it. In fact, dip is more addictive and physically harmful than kratom. Should we jail people for using it too? 

Yes, it's a substance that mimics morphine in some ways. But kratom does NOT cause respiratory depression -- that's what kills people who overdose on painkillers. There have been 0 recorded deaths that have been linked to kratom alone, only a few deaths where kratom was one substance among many that an individual took.  Thousands and thousands of people die from opioid overdoses each year in the U.S., it's an epidemic. Kratom--because it acts similarly to morphine without causing respiratory depression--can safely eliminate withdrawal symptoms, ease cravings, and make life livable for opioid addicts. Someone can take kratom everyday and live a productive, healthy life. Someone cannot take painkillers, heroin, or alcohol everyday and live a productive, healthy life. Kratom saves lives, making it schedule I makes deadly overdoses more likely. It will also result in more people being thrown in jail for long periods of time due to non-violent drug offenses.

Kratom does not have to be 100% harmless all of the time in order for it to be less addictive and less harmful than dip. It deserves to be taxed, regulated, and kept legal.",2016-09-02T08:45:38+00:00

I could have just stopped there, after my relevant point, *but I didn't*. I went ahead to endorse your point about **not** putting kratom on Schedule 1, so that it *could* be studied, and even threw in a bonus page where people are attempting to collect medical studies about it. And -- since this is the Green Party page, and Presidential Candidate Jill Stein is a physician -- you might want to ask, *pointedly*, **""As a physician, what does Jill Stein think of kratom?""** I'm neither *for nor against* kratom; I just want you to make more cogent arguments. And -- in your second response there -- *you did*: that sums up all the good points right there, and heads off most potential downsides right up front.

USpolitics,comment,Obamacare,kf0kozn,auldnate,,"In 2006, I had a brain tumor removed from the center of my head. Afterwards, I developed a mild version of narcolepsy that requires me to take medication to wake up and function as a human being. By 2013, I was paying $1,203 each month for refills of my medication until I reached a $5,000 deductible.

The next year, Obamacare went into full effect. Since then, I have now saved $95,000 over 10 years. This is thanks to the Patient Protections for Preexisting Conditions that prevent insurers from discriminating against me. And the Cost Sharing Reductions that provide subsidies for people with low incomes (I earn $12.70 per hour as a caregiver for people with disabilities through Medicaid) in the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act (also known as the ACA, or Obamacare).

This past year (and theoretically next year as well), I didn’t have to pay anything out of pocket for refills with 15 extra pills of that exact same narcolepsy medication. And that was before I reached a $50 deductible. Next year, I don’t even have a deductible!

So I pay close attention to any Republican efforts to “repeal and replace Obamacare.” The strategy they most often propose for helping people with Preexisting Conditions is to create a “High Risk Pool” for us that Congress will supposedly provide coverage to.

In other words, they want to create another so called “entitlement program” where they get to decide if an individual’s health care needs are sufficient to receive government provided coverage. Forgive my skepticism, but I don’t trust those greedy bastards to include everyone who benefits from Obamacare at the levels necessary.

Hypothetically  speaking (or is it theoretically speaking?), let's say Bernie Sanders wins and he wants Universal  Healthcare for everyone... what are all the steps involved to get something like that fully enacted and up-and-running? Is this what's  called a 'bill'? Would this be 'passing a bill'? What would happen to insurance companies? How likely is it that, if he's elected, Universal Healthcare actually becomes a thing? How long would it take to be fully implemented?

I'm *very* confused on how the government works. It was not an interesting subject for me growing up. I never studied it in college. It's just not my cup of tea. But it's something I'm very interested in now.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

USpolitics,comment,Universal healthcare,f7e620j,mutatron,,"First someone writes up a bill in the House, then they all haggle over the details. Then the Senate marks it up and changes some things, and they send it back to the House. This goes on until everybody’s happy, then the president signs it into law. 

There would have to be a transition period. Bernie’s bill has a four year transition, and then there are no health insurance companies after that. Probably enrollment in M4A would happen by age cohorts - 50 to 64, 35 to 48, 20 to 34, and 0 to 19. It’s likely health insurance companies would transition into government contractors, since someone would still have to do the paperwork involved in coverage. 

The private share of healthcare costs in the US is about $1.2 trillion out of the $3.6 trillion total, so around 2/3 of a new system is already paid for. The average per capita cost of that is about $300/month, but for the average citizen this cost would be brought down by subsidies from progressive taxes. 

Personally I feel the final system will include supplemental insurance like Medicare does now, which will also bring down the per capita cost of the base offering.",2019-11-13T12:26:12+00:00

Dreams of paperwork I think are intended to be a deterrent so doctors give up because there's spending more time doing the forms then actually spending time with patients.

It is infuriating that businesses are doing this. 

It is disgusting that healthcare is a business.

""They're all in favor of the unborn. They will do anything for the unborn. But once you're born, you're on your own. Pro-life conservatives are obsessed with the fetus from conception to nine months. 

After that, they don't want to know about you. 

They don't want to hear from you. No nothing. No neonatal care, no day care, no head start, no school lunch, no food stamps, no welfare, no nothing.

If you're preborn, you're fine; if you're preschool, you're fucked. 

Conservatives don't give a shit about you until you reach military age. Then they think you're just fine. Just what they've been looking for. Conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers. 

Pro-life... pro-life... These people aren't pro-life, they're killing doctors! What kind of pro-life is that? What, they'll do anything they can to save a fetus but if it grows up to be a doctor they just might have to kill it? 

They're not pro-life. You know what they are? They're anti-woman. Simple as it gets, anti-woman. They don't like them. They don't like women. They believe a woman's primary role is to function as a brood mare for the state.""

She barely gets enough to scrape by after medical bills and prescriptions each month and does so while worrying constantly about ""retirement"" and how that is just another word for ""burden"" on her kids, in her mind. She's not allowed to do anything that would generate extra dollars without the extreme risk of her disability being yanked away.

Biden won. Trump lost in states he was almost certain to win.  The Republicans appeared to be losing Senate, also, and later did so.

How did Democrats behave?

They agreed to an even lower amount than Trump proposed for months.

What excuse is there now? Here, let me break it down in math for you. I do not want to imply you are not smart in any way, so do not take it that way, but many people just do not do the math or think of these massive numbers specifically.

The Republicans proposed 1.9 trillion which was rejected by the Democrats. This was back in October. Now, it sounds as though 1.9 trillion would not have been enough to pay 2000 dollars to each person, but, the math proves that incorrect.

After Biden won and the Republicans were losing big the actual final amount Congress got through was .9.  Trump at that stage started pushing $2000 checks, but Congress would not budge.

Now, here is the math part which makes this so absurd, because, we are told that there is bipartisan support for the $2000, but, it did not happen.

>October Bill Passed By House: 2.2 T  
>  
>October Proposal From White House: 1.9 T  
>  
>Final Amount Agreed Upon: .9 T  
>  
>Individual check total: 600  
>  
>Missing Amount Compared to 2000: 1400  
>  
>Amount of First Round Stimulus Payments: 153 M  
>  
>153 M x 1400 = 214,200,000,000, or about .2 T  
>  
>.9 T + .2 T = 1.1 T

Even if they had increased the checks to 2000 dollars, the total bill would have been 800 billion dollars LESS then the Republicans INITIALLY PROPOSED!!!!!!!!

The Democrats lied, straight up, and fucked everyone on purpose.

Some good friends of mine are begging me to support Hillary Clinton. As a typical independent voter with a brain, and as such one of the controlling plurality of American voters, I need answers to some questions before I can consider doing so.

First, some background charts and graphs: 

* [US tuition and healthcare are both increasing faster than incomes](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Blogs/2014/11/25-scott-blog/Median-income-and-change-in-price-of-select-goods-for-blog.jpg) ([source](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/the-avenue/posts/2014/11/25-innovation-price-index-andes-muro)), and 

* [The US middle class no longer participates in economic recoveries](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f4c1a3_41160468c4d04a2d9c24592dbf94ed99.jpg/v1/fill/w_803,h_428,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/f4c1a3_41160468c4d04a2d9c24592dbf94ed99.jpg) ([source](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/pn_15_4.pdf).)

So my current issues preventing me from supporting Hillary Clinton are:

1. Why do [her higher education proposals](http://www.documentcloud.org/search/preview?q=projectid%3A+21826-hillary-clinton-higher-ed-white-papers+&slug=projectid-21826-hillary-clinton-higher-ed-white-papers&options=%7B%22q%22%3A%22projectid%3A+21826-hillary-clinton-higher-ed-white-papers+%22%2C%22container%22%3A%22%23DC-search-projectid-21826-hillary-clinton-higher-ed-white-papers%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Hillary+Clinton+Higher+Education+Plans%22%2C%22order%22%3A%22title%22%2C%22per_page%22%3A%2212%22%2C%22search_bar%22%3Afalse%2C%22organization%22%3A830%7D) not include anything like ""debt free college"" that she claimed on December 19? Why do they have no tuition caps, no caps on college administrator pay (which has been skyrocketing [in the US as fast as CEO salaries](https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2014/09/It-pays-to-be-a-CEO-in-the-U-S-The-ratio-between-CEO-and-average-worker-pay_chartbuilder.png)), or any support for the salaries of adjunct faculty, who in many if not most cases are on food assistance?

2. Why on https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/ is ""public option"" in scare quotes instead of being [hyperlinked to a bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3737) or other implementation plan for financial analysis?

3. How can we reconcile her [approval of international arms sales of guns used in US mass shootings](https://twitter.com/GoldmanHandcuff/status/732039609719214080) ([source](https://medium.com/@JeanetteJing/secretary-clinton-approved-millions-in-global-sales-for-the-sandy-hook-gun-maker-9e8b0e78c58d))? This is a big one for me, almost as big as her statement in the first Democratic debate about wanting to send American troops to Syria against Assad and ISIS, both sides in an Iraq-like boondoggle. I am unable to reconcile it with her anti-gun stance. 

4. If political donations don't influence her, [why did she stop accepting money from private prisons?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-private-prisons_us_562a3e3ee4b0ec0a389418ec)

USpolitics,post,Public option,173th4i,Georgeo57,AI Peacemaker Test: What would cause the United States to support a two state plan to end the war in Israel?,"There are a number of factors that could cause the United States to support a two-state plan to end the war in Israel. These include:

* **A change in Israeli public opinion:** If there is a significant increase in support for a two-state solution among Israeli voters, the US government may be more likely to pressure Israel to pursue this option.
* **A regional initiative:** If a group of Arab countries were to come forward with a comprehensive peace proposal that includes a two-state solution, the US government may be more likely to support it.
* **A new US administration:** If a US administration is elected that is more committed to the two-state solution, it may be more likely to put pressure on both sides to reach an agreement.
* **A humanitarian crisis:** If the humanitarian situation in Gaza deteriorates significantly, the US government may be more likely to support a two-state solution as a way to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people.
* **A growing threat from Iran:** If the US government perceives Iran as a growing threat, it may be more likely to support a two-state solution as a way to promote stability in the region.

It is important to note that there are also a number of factors that could prevent the United States from supporting a two-state solution. These include:

* **The political situation in Israel:** If the Israeli government is opposed to a two-state solution, it will be difficult for the US government to pressure Israel to pursue this option.
* **The domestic political climate in the US:** If the US public is not supportive of a two-state solution, it will be difficult for the US government to take a leading role in promoting it.
* **The opposition of regional actors:** If key regional actors, such as Iran and Syria, are opposed to a two-state solution, it will be difficult for the US government to implement it.

Overall, the decision of whether or not to support a two-state solution is a complex one that will be influenced by a variety of factors. The US government has traditionally supported a two-state solution, but it is unclear whether it will continue to do so if the current situation does not change.

USpolitics,post,Public option,zh19rp,acerthorn,What if another Trump-appointed judge dismisses his criminal charges regarding classified records?,"So it's not secret that the district court judge in the case of Trump v. United States was a Trump-appointed judge. Also, it the general consensus that she appointed that special master mostly to return the favor to Trump for giving her a lifetime job.

Well, if Trump is inevitably indicted, what would happen if another Trump-appointed judge in that district was assigned to handle the case? While it isn't a foregone conclusion that, by dint of him being a Trump-appointed judge, he necessarily is going to be biased in favor of Trump (after all, 2 of the 3 appellate court justices were also Trump-appointed, and they overwhelmingly publicly shamed the first District Court judge), the fact that a Trump-appointed judge has already shown favoritism means that it is still a possibility that the next Trump-appointed judge will do the same. After all, being publicly shamed by the Court of Appeals isn't the same thing as a sanction, and that first judge is still free to issue biased rulings from the bench.

At least with the civil case, the government had the right to appeal the verdict. But in a criminal case, once the defendant is acquitted or has his charges dismissed FOR ANY REASON, then that's it. Case closed. The Defendant walks. It doesn't matter if the judge was biased, or if he issued a blatantly unlawful ruling. An acquittal or dismissal of charges of any kind cannot even so much as be appealed, for literally any reason whatsoever. See Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U.S. 141 (1962).

If a district judge not appointed by Trump gets appointed to his criminal case, we're in like flynn. But if a Trump-appointed judge gets appointed, the prosecution only has one option: File a motion to recuse, a motion which the judge can simply deny. He can point to the fact that the appellate court panel in the related civil case was 2/3 Trump-appointees as proof that he is not necessarily going to be biased in favor of Trump, and once he does that, the prosecution will have no further recourse. If a Defendant moves to recuse and that motion is denied, he can file an appeal only after he's convicted (as opposed to what  Glenn Kirschner publicly described as ""the hamster wheel of endless appeals"" in civil cases that Trump was hoping to exploit in order to run out the clock). But if the proseuction moves to recuse, that motion is denied, and the biased judge proceeds to issue a directed verdict in his appointer's favor, then that's it. Case closed. Trump goes free.

USpolitics,comment,Public option,gaukpom,bobbelcher,,"Biden has not called for only a government-run plan. He has called for a voluntary public option alongside private options. 

The ad leaps to conclusions about how Biden’s plan would impact  hospitals and Medicare coverage, relying largely on articles by groups  that oppose the public option. Experts said Biden’s plan doesn’t include  enough specifics to reach conclusions, but it’s a stretch to conclude  that he would put Medicare coverage at risk. The study the campaign  cited about the public option leading to rural hospital closures cites a  huge range and makes some assumptions and also acknowledges that rural  hospitals are already closing.

The only kernel here is that Biden’s plan allows immigrants here  illegally to pay for health insurance, but it’s misleading to state that  he would ""give"" them the benefits.",2020-11-02T00:36:51+00:00

USpolitics,comment,Health insurance marketplace,kzj1uzt,Leather-Map-8138,,"This is because the business of financial risk sharing with providers has reached nearly all health insurance products. It’s increasingly likely your doctor has a financial interest in keeping your costs down, and they’re personally getting a share of the difference between your expenses and a target amount, as a bonus to their salary. And their job might be at risk in the future if they don’t succeed. This is done at an aggregate level, of all patients tied to a particular contract, but the way a doctor succeeds with the least change to his/herpractice behavior is to limit high cost treatment options to a last resort, if they’re ever offered. They’ll agree to make sure you’re seen at least once a year and remind you about post-hospital visits, but that’s office, not physian, work. You may not think you’ve got a dollar sign tattooed on your forehead, but your doctor has told by his employer to look for it. 

These programs are masked in buzzwords. For example there’s a thing called a Medicare ACO, which stands for “Accountable Care Organization.” It’s now on its second iteration, but the first one was incredibly easy for provider groups to commit fraud. Back at the beginning, independent practice associations would know who their highest and lowest performers were, and they’d include all the lowest performers in the group which established a baseline. Over the next two years, they’d add the rest of the doctors, allowing them to report significant improvements in cost and quality, without doing anything to improve cost or quality. Look at any report of high performing ACOs, and it’ll include a bunch of them which did a version of this or something similar.",2024-04-14T13:22:27+00:00

More on Tax Inversion
These companies aren’t simply packing their bags and setting up an address overseas. They are performing what is called a “tax inversion.” This is where an American company merges with one located in a country with lower taxes. They then either give the owners of the foreign company at least a fifth ownership of the new business or do at least one fourth of its business overseas. From 1983 to 2003, only 29 U.S. companies did a tax inversion. From 2004 to 2013, 47 U.S. companies have completed a tax inversion, with more anticipated in the future.

1. Burger King
What’s more American than cheeseburgers? Apparently Canada, as that is where the fast food giant that used to be located in Miami moved to in order to tax invert. With the American corporate tax rate of 35%, the owners and proprietors of Burger King found that Ontario’s rate of 26.5% was far more favorable, Canadian federal rate of 15% plus an 11.5% state rate. This was in response to Canada lowering their rates from 28%. A report published in 2014 named Canada as the leading country for tax structures, with the United Kingdom second and the Netherlands at third. Burger King saved so much money, it considered buying Canadian giant Tim Horton’s (coffee and doughnuts) that same year.

2. Pfizer
The pharmaceutical giant that is behind Viagra, Lipitor, Lyrica, Zithromax, and many other drugs was founded all the way back in 1849 in a simple brick building in Brooklyn. For years now, the company has been threatening to tax invert by buying cosmetic surgical product giant Allergan (a leading supplier of breast implants). Earlier Pfizer had put in a $160 billion bid to buy Astra Zeneca in order to tax invert but was blocked. If it is successful in this current bid, its 78,000 employees will be in danger, and its $50 billion in revenue will be moved overseas.

3. Ford
Have you heard Donald Trump’s outrage over Ford moving a plant to Mexico? It isn’t the first time the auto maker has moved operations in order to save taxes, and we don’t think it will be the last. Earlier this year, Ford revealed it would be building a new car assembly plant for its small cars south of the border and take thousands of jobs with it. The company will invest $1.6 billion to create 2,800 additional direct jobs in Mexico by the end of 2020, and construction on the plant is set to begin as soon as this summer. This has been going on for a while with Mexico being Ford’s 4th largest manufacturing site behind China at 3rd, Germany at 2nd, and the United States at first. With all this movement, is a complete move far behind?

4. Nabisco
In another move made famous by Donald Trump, the makers of Oreos, Chip Ahoy, and many other American favorites have made the move south of the border. In 2015, Nabisco laid off half of its 1,200 employees in its Chicago branch in order to maximize the efficiency of their new factory in the city of Salinas, Mexico. The company needed to spend an additional $130 billion to upgrade its American factory, even though the Mexican corporate tax rate of 30% isn’t too much better than the American – if you think $6.5 billion isn’t a lot of money.

5. Medtronic
You may have never heard of them, but if you use a medical device, chances are it was made and/or designed by them. Medtronic was founded in 1949 in Minneapolis to repair medical equipment and evolved to take in revenues in the billions, employ 84,000 people, and assist millions of patients. In 2014, the company moved its headquarters to Ireland, a favorite among pharmaceutical and medical companies. With $13 billion in assets set to be taxed at a rate of 35%, it begs the question: would you move for $4.55 billion dollars?

The Future of Tax Inversion
Only the new president and Congress can decide whether to continue policies that drive away business or work with them to some mutual benefit, but here’s what President Obama has said of this: “It’s not that they’re (corporations) breaking the laws, it’s that the laws are so poorly designed that they allow people…to wiggle out of responsibilities … that lost revenue has to be made up somewhere.”

3.  Failure - If we take a limited approach its feasible that we will not overthrow Assad.
4.  Opportunity Cost - Money can be invested in domestic priorities like education, healthcare, etc.
5. Replacing one negative government with another negative possibly more negative government - Do you really want a theocratic Sunni establishment like Egypt?  Or lawlessness like Libya?  The autocrats actually protected the religious minorities

USpolitics,post,healthcare costs,12awb9f,shallah,Senator wants answers about for-profit Iowa hospital where a nurse assaulted unconscious female patients,"
A powerful Senate Republican is demanding answers from a private-equity backed hospital in southeast Iowa amid revelations that a male nurse practitioner at the facility sexually assaulted nine female patients there in 2021 and 2022.

The facility, Ottumwa Regional Health Center, is part of Lifepoint Health Inc., a hospital system headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, and owned by Apollo Global Management, the huge private-equity firm in New York co-founded by Leon Black.


The incidents at the Ottumwa facility came to light late last year after the overdose death in the hospital of Devin Caraccio, 27, a certified nurse practitioner who was a contract employee at the hospital, according to its spokeswoman. After he died on the job in October, the Ottumwa police accessed his cellphone, finding photo and video evidence that he had assaulted the patients, according to a police department investigator, Jeremy Tosh. 

The police department said in a statement in December that “It is suspected that all of the victims were asleep, or in a state of unconsciousness when the assaults took place.” Two of the victims have not yet been identified; two were under 18, Tosh said in an interview last week.

Eight-term Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa sent a letter last month to the hospital, Lifepoint Health and Apollo’s chief executive, Marc Rowan. In it, he asked whether financial practices had reduced money for patient care and may have facilitated the sexual assault.

One of Grassley’s questions was whether Apollo contractually shields itself from liability for activities that occur at hospitals it invests in, operates or manages. He also asked Apollo to detail its “expertise regarding rural or non-urban hospitals.”


A spokeswoman for Apollo said: “Our funds are investors in Lifepoint and we are responding to the questions from Senator Grassley’s office.”

In addition to Ottumwa Regional, Lifepoint has more than 60 acute care hospitals in 17 states, including Arizona, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia. The facility in Ottumwa, a town of 25,000, is one of many rural hospitals owned by Lifepoint; it is the only hospital in the 432-square-mile county of Wapello. 

Rural hospitals have experienced considerable financial pressure in recent years, alleviated somewhat by government relief funds disbursed during the pandemic. According to research from the KFF, a nonprofit group formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation, median operating margins at rural hospitals before the pandemic were 1.5%, versus 5.2% for nonrural facilities.

In a statement, Cara Clouse, a spokeswoman for Ottumwa Regional Health Center, said the facility is committed to the safety and well-being of its patients.

“The heinous acts of this former contractor clearly violate our policies and values, and our hearts are with all those affected by his misconduct,” she said. “Ottumwa Regional continues to cooperate with law enforcement, and we have adopted a number of reforms to further strengthen our controls and security to safeguard those we serve and prevent rogue bad actors.”

A Lifepoint spokeswoman said that the company “is deeply disturbed by the terrible acts committed by a contractor at Ottumwa Regional Health Center,” and that the company is implementing “new policies and reforms to help ensure patients and their families are protected.”

Over the past decade, private-equity firms like Apollo have spent hundreds of billions of dollars buying up health care businesses, including nursing homes, hospital staffing companies and physician practices. To finance these purchases, private-equity owners typically burden the companies they buy with debt, then slash the companies’ costs to increase earnings and appeal to potential buyers down the road.  


HCA Healthcare's low staffing levels accused of endangering patients
In the business of health care, the drive for profits can run counter to the goal of helping patients, critics say. 


Caraccio’s assaults on patients raise ""serious questions with respect to whether these hospitals have the right resources or if they are being loaded with overwhelming amounts of debt to the point where they are forced to shift money away from patient care,” Grassley wrote in his letter. It also went to the CEO of Lifepoint Health; the chief executive of Warburg Pincus, another private-equity firm that owned Ottumwa Regional Health Center before Apollo bought it; and the CEO of Medical Properties Trust, a real estate investment company that had conducted a financial transaction involving the facility. 


Apollo bought the Ottumwa facility in 2015 from Warburg Pincus, and it became part of RegionalCare Hospital Partners. A flurry of transactions followed: The next year, Apollo merged RegionalCare with Capella, another health care company, and in 2018 Apollo merged those operations with Lifepoint Health. 

Then, in 2019, Medical Properties Trust bought the real estate under 10 Lifepoint hospitals, including Ottumwa Regional, leasing them back to the facilities. Private-equity firms often conduct such transactions, generating cash for themselves and their partners from the sale of real estate underlying the facilities, but often saddling the hospitals with increased costs in rents. 

The sale and leaseback of the real estate in Ottumwa does not appear to have added to the facility’s rental costs, according to a person briefed on the transaction.


Nevertheless, such transactions are a concern to Grassley. “The constant selling and reselling of hospital assets by private equity, private capital, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and other related entities raises questions with respect to whether these financial maneuvers have negatively impacted the resources and thereby the care our nation’s rural hospitals provide to their patients,” he noted in his letter.

The Lifepoint spokeswoman said: “The actions of this one disturbed individual do not reflect who we are, our core values, or how we operate any hospital and in no way can be linked to Ottumwa Regional’s financial standing. Lifepoint is proud of the substantial investments we have made since becoming a part of the Ottumwa community in 2018, including the more than $31 million in facility and technology updates and for physician recruitment and retention.”

A spokesman for Grassley said the investigation by his office is ongoing. The recipients of his letter were asked to respond by Friday, March 31. The spokeswoman for the hospital declined to comment on the letter.",2023-04-03T20:14:10+00:00

politics,comment,ACA,dj94c5s,SteveGladstone,,"I sound like a broken record, but this is yet another healthcare reform bill that fails to fix the underlying cost of healthcare.  I haven't read the whole thing (busy at work), but the majority of measures I'm seeing involve ways to not pay for things versus ways to lower costs of goods/services in general.  That puts it in the same boat as the House bill which followed the ""lower costs by not covering/paying for it"" model.  Such a model fails the people. 

Real reform involves fixing the underlying costs.  To copypasta a long (sorry!) list I wrote before, underlying issues with healthcare include-

1)  The majority of primary care physicians [overtreating](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26633255) by prescribing brand name drugs and specialists when such are not needed.

2)  Addressing drug costs by pushing generics and by curbing the biosimilar problem.  Biosimilars aka follow-on aka ""me too"" aka incrementally modified drugs (IMD's) are drugs which NIH says [offer no real clinical benefit over generics](https://www.nihcm.org/pdf/innovations.pdf).  

3)  Related to the previous point, we need to address evergreening and drug exclusivity.   As a result of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (ie, Hatch-Waxman) and the BCPI under the ACA. Under Hatch-Waxman, the five years of data exclusivity prevent generics from being brought to market, essentially extending the patent protection for such an incrementally modified drug (aka follow-on aka ""me too"" aka biosimilar, and so on). Plus when drug companies tell the FDA what patents it believes are covered by a drug, the FDA tends to not check and somewhat blindly extends the life of those patents if there are regulatory delays thanks to orange book inclusion.

4)  Also related is the cost of those IMD's.  [They cost us billions](http://www.nber.org/papers/w19522.pdf) versus generics, which the Medicare For All bill tries to address... but what the bill does not discuss is how this is a 20 year trend in the pharmaceutical industry.  NIH did a [study](http://www.nihcm.org/pdf/innovations.pdf) showing that from the time of Hatch-Waxman to 2000, 35% of drug approvals were new molecular entities (ie, real ""new"" drugs), 54% were IMD's, and 11% were drugs identical to products already available on the market. Since 2000, NME's make up even less of the drug approval rates while IMD's are ever increasing and, with them, new market and data exclusivity periods which in turn hurts competition and innovation. NIH tells us between 1989 and 2000 that 76% of NDA's (and 86% of IMD's) fell in the category of ""these drugs did not appear to provide significant clinical improvement over marketed products."" Between 1990 and 2004, [only 22% of drugs approved offered significant clinical benefits over existing drugs and only 14% were NME's](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2162597).  You might think things improved since then, but more [current studies](http://www.who.int/intellectualproperty/topics/ip/Me-tooDrugs_Hollis1.pdf) show that about 50% of a drug's R&D cost is in clinical testing... but also that 80% of drug clinical testing done today covers IMD's, in no small part because they are not significantly different and get market/data exclusivity benefits.  This is a major underlying issue that the bill does not address.

5)  We need to give back to taxpayers healthcare innovations funded by tax dollars.  Because of the [Baye-Doyle Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayh%E2%80%93Dole_Act) in the 70's, we pay more for healthcare in part because government funded R&D doesn't receive the [kind of benefits we ought to](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/bayh-dole.htm).  

6)  The entire drug testing system needs work.  Currently, a pharmaceutical firm looks for a contract research organization (CRO) that will forge and conduct testing favorable to the ""new"" drug they wish to bring to market.  CRO's are put in a tough spot because their revenue is partially dependent upon finding favorable results (repeat business is good).  The lack of real, independent testing creates a system where medicine may be more harmful than beneficial.  

7)  While clinical trials are required to be registered and reported on clinicaltrials.gov, [fewer than 1 in 8 have results reported on time](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/30/12/2338.long).  Worse, the data that is reported is often incomplete and unusable from a transparency/verification/future benefit perspective.  We should be using that information for bettering our prescriptions and healthcare, not as a mere hurdle for pharmaceutical firms to jump over.  

7)  Post-market monitoring needs work.  Firms can delay reporting adverse effects for a year.  In other words, adverse effects of a new opiod may very well be known, but it wouldn't need to be reported until a year (or more) to the FDA for investigation.  That's potentially billions in revenue at the expense of healthcare addiction.  

8)  Off-label uses and getting into the FDA's [orange book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approved_Drug_Products_with_Therapeutic_Equivalence_Evaluations) need investigating as things like Medicare won't cover off-label uses.  That means off-label uses of something like [aspirin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2878253/) that may have been studied extensively and reported on in numerous journals wouldn't be covered.  Current orange book requirements, as I understand them, are a bit strong/restrictive and could use some work.  

9)  Fixing healthcare IT.  This is an ongoing issue and funding/grants should be given to aid organizations in this regard.  This also includes fixing the DoD/VA EHR problem I mentioned, which the GAO labeled [high risk](http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ehr/gao-lack-interoperability-between-dod-va-health-records-high-risk).  Those are the things that increase cost and delay care.  Interoperability [is a growing priority](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/interoperability-growing-priority-healthcare-leaders-himss-says) and fixes to our system to lower costs and increase efficacy must include that.  

All of that is a start.  And in fairness, since I wrote that, the DoD and VA are getting on the same page with EHR interoperability... To a degree.  

But fixing all that could save us tens to hundreds of billions a year on healthcare without degrading coverage or quality.  This is why I'm so disappointed by the Senate and House bills: the crafters of these bills seem to look at the cost and their political talking points to make change without considering the consequences or alternatives (or ignoring them if they are).  

I hope the CBO reviews this!

I'm on Medicaid and it just took me six weeks to get a new motor for my wheelchair. Six weeks for one motor where I could not work (plot twist: I'm disabled AND I have a job). 

Medicaid isn't perfect but it *works*. Cutting it will force people like me to pay full price for prescription medications I can't not take. I'm at a point where the next cold I get could kill me when it's *already* hard to find doctor in my area that takes Medicaid. It's getting harder for my parents to care for me so I rely on personal care assistants. Without them, I could very well end up in a nursing home.

What did I and the millions of people like me do to deserve this? When someone in your town without health insurance gets major surgery, a GoFundMe is set up and everybody rallies around and pitches. But as soon as there's a call to do that on a larger scale, we can't because SOCIALISM! You know how this bill would cut health insurance to give tax breaks for the rich? That's socialism my friend.

politics,comment,ACA,dj95eb0,PPActionFund,,"Hi all - Planned Parenthood Action Fund staff here weighing in with what we know about this bill.

First, we strongly oppose the just-released Senate version of Trumpcare.
 
This bill is the worst bill for women in a generation. In addition to “defunding” Planned Parenthood and slashing Medicaid, it guts Essential Health Benefit protections, including maternity coverage and prescription drugs. [Thirteen million women](https://tcf.org/content/commentary/millions-lose-health-benefits-congress-repeals-states-replace-aca/) could lose coverage to maternity care under this bill.
 
Experts also agree that the “defund” Planned Parenthood provision is a violation of the Byrd Rule because it is politically-motivated policy, similar to the tax credit provision related to abortion. It has no place on reconciliation because it violates these rules, and it has no place on any legislation because it is the epitome of a mean-spirited policy that hurts millions of women. 
  
**Now is the time for every person who cares about women’s health and access to affordable quality care to speak out and join this fight.** The American people [strongly oppose](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2443) blocking women from going to Planned Parenthood for preventive care. 

**We must get louder than ever so our elected officials finally start listening to us.**
 
So make calls to the Senate NOW. Make them all day. Make multiple calls to both of your Senators. These calls work. [[We're seeing rumors already that there will be some GOP public opposition to the bill.]](https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/877913883926609920)

politics,comment,ACA,dj9lgeb,Fastgirl600,,"Our politics are divided. They have been for a long time. And while I know that division makes it difficult to listen to Americans with whom we disagree, that’s what we need to do today.

I recognize that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a core tenet of the Republican Party. Still, I hope that our Senators, many of whom I know well, step back and measure what’s really at stake, and consider that the rationale for action, on health care or any other issue, must be something more than simply undoing something that Democrats did.

We didn’t fight for the Affordable Care Act for more than a year in the public square for any personal or political gain – we fought for it because we knew it would save lives, prevent financial misery, and ultimately set this country we love on a better, healthier course.

Nor did we fight for it alone. Thousands upon thousands of Americans, including Republicans, threw themselves into that collective effort, not for political reasons, but for intensely personal ones – a sick child, a parent lost to cancer, the memory of medical bills that threatened to derail their dreams.

And you made a difference. For the first time, more than ninety percent of Americans know the security of health insurance. Health care costs, while still rising, have been rising at the slowest pace in fifty years. Women can’t be charged more for their insurance, young adults can stay on their parents’ plan until they turn 26, contraceptive care and preventive care are now free. Paying more, or being denied insurance altogether due to a preexisting condition – we made that a thing of the past.

We did these things together. So many of you made that change possible.

At the same time, I was careful to say again and again that while the Affordable Care Act represented a significant step forward for America, it was not perfect, nor could it be the end of our efforts – and that if Republicans could put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we made to our health care system, that covers as many people at less cost, I would gladly and publicly support it.

That remains true. So I still hope that there are enough Republicans in Congress who remember that public service is not about sport or notching a political win, that there’s a reason we all chose to serve in the first place, and that hopefully, it’s to make people’s lives better, not worse.

But right now, after eight years, the legislation rushed through the House and the Senate without public hearings or debate would do the opposite. It would raise costs, reduce coverage, roll back protections, and ruin Medicaid as we know it. That’s not my opinion, but rather the conclusion of all objective analyses, from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which found that 23 million Americans would lose insurance, to America’s doctors, nurses, and hospitals on the front lines of our health care system.

The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill. It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America. It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else. Those with private insurance will experience higher premiums and higher deductibles, with lower tax credits to help working families cover the costs, even as their plans might no longer cover pregnancy, mental health care, or expensive prescriptions. Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions could become the norm again. Millions of families will lose coverage entirely.

Simply put, if there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family – this bill will do you harm. And small tweaks over the course of the next couple weeks, under the guise of making these bills easier to stomach, cannot change the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation.

I hope our Senators ask themselves – what will happen to the Americans grappling with opioid addiction who suddenly lose their coverage? What will happen to pregnant mothers, children with disabilities, poor adults and seniors who need long-term care once they can no longer count on Medicaid? What will happen if you have a medical emergency when insurance companies are once again allowed to exclude the benefits you need, send you unlimited bills, or set unaffordable deductibles? What impossible choices will working parents be forced to make if their child’s cancer treatment costs them more than their life savings?

To put the American people through that pain – while giving billionaires and corporations a massive tax cut in return – that’s tough to fathom. But it’s what’s at stake right now. So it remains my fervent hope that we step back and try to deliver on what the American people need.

That might take some time and compromise between Democrats and Republicans. But I believe that’s what people want to see. I believe it would demonstrate the kind of leadership that appeals to Americans across party lines. And I believe that it’s possible – if you are willing to make a difference again. If you’re willing to call your members of Congress. If you are willing to visit their offices. If you are willing to speak out, let them and the country know, in very real terms, what this means for you and your family.

After all, this debate has always been about something bigger than politics. It’s about the character of our country – who we are, and who we aspire to be. And that’s always worth fighting for.

They've kept the protections for preexisting conditions and have kicked the medicaid rollback can down the road far enough that moderate R's will have an easier time signing on. They also got rid of the abortion restrictions because it would've complicated the reconciliation rules. They've still got all the tax cuts to the top earners that funded the ACA though, and they're still rolling back medicaid, just doing it slower. 

Their biggest issue is that this looks a helluva lot less like a repeal and more like tweaking. Hardliners may say that this isn't a repeal at all. The Freedom Caucus in particular is going to take issue almost assuredly. ",2017-06-22T15:19:06+00:00

politics,comment,Universal healthcare,dlz74zw,rediKELous,,"Healthcare is fundamentally uninsurable.  I work in insurance.  Insurance is based on being able to predictably calculate the risk of a particular event occurring versus what the likely payout would be.  With car insurance, we can reliably calculate the risk of someone having an accident, and can charge based upon the value of their vehicle and the liability limits they choose (a defined maximum payout).  With life insurance, we can calculate the risk of you dying in a particular span, and charge based upon the death benefit (a defined payout).  With health insurance, there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY to reliably calculate what a health event will cost someone.  There is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY to assume in large numbers what sorts of ailments they might have to pay out for.  Unlike the risk of an accident, or dying during the term of a life policy, YOU WILL 100% INCUR large medical expenses at some point in life unless you are a healthy person who say, dies suddenly in a car crash (we insure the highest risk group of older people on Medicare already).  Again, health insurance, by the definition of insurance, is not a profitable industry, and therefore cannot be insured reasonably for profit.  As I mentioned, we already insure the highest risk group through taxes.  If we combined that risk pool with younger healthy people and everyone in-between, the risk pools become better and more predictable, and there is much greater bargaining power, therefore reducing costs.",2017-08-22T17:45:24+00:00

In our care system ... if your doctor finds an issue, you're referred off to a specialist. The graver the condition and the higher the priority, the quicker you see the specialist. 

Are there waits? Sure. A guy I know waited 8 months for knee replacement surgery, but he got it. In the US system, he wouldn't have because his 'preexisting conditions' would have all but disqualified him from insurance coverage (if he had it) and he could not afford the cost out of pocket. 

If money is no concern, the US system is great. You can buy your way to the front of the line, you can even buy entire hospital floors for [yourself](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/nyregion/after-birth-by-beyonce-patients-protest-celebrity-security-at-lenox-hill-hospital.html) at the expense of others if you want.

But if money / insurance *is* a concern, the US system quickly falls flat.",2020-02-15T16:50:09+00:00
politics,comment,Single-payer system,fhp5556,kellogg9,,"Yup. As a Canadian it is definitely the better of the systems.  It's suicide to be on the USA pay-or-die system.  How Americans have been told to fear Single-payer for so long is a true testiment to the power of fake news media and propaganda ads.

There was a Canadian poll asking if we Canadians would prefer the current Canadian healthcare system or the USA's private healthcare.  It broke the poll down into Conservative Candians and Liberal Canadians.  The results: 98% (combined) said to keep our system.  Conservatives were at 95%.

The only flaw with our system is that our single-payer doesn't go far enough.  We want it to cover extra things like dental, which it currently does not.  That will almost universally be the reason why we would complain about it.  American's making up shit like we have long lines and we hate our system are LYING to you.  We don't have long lines, and we most certainly dont hate our system.  We also have walk-in clinics everywhere.

politics,comment,Coverage,kqojgyf,GahbageDumpstahFiah,,"A body language expert brought on air by Fox News to assess Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis said that during her hearing in Georgia on Thursday she was ""all confidence.""

Expert Tonya Reiman told host Laura Ingraham that Willis looked like someone ""used to being in front of an audience,"" as she gave testimony in a hearing to determine if she should be disqualified from the Donald Trump election interference case.

Newsweek has approached Fox News for comment via email outside of working hours.

Trump and 18 other defendants are facing racketeering charges in connection with alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in a case brought by Willis and her team. He denies the charges and says they are politically motivated.

Co-defendant Michael Roman says in a legal filing the case should be thrown out because a relationship between Willis and special prosecutor Nathan Wade was a conflict of interest. Willis denies any wrongdoing.

Roman's attorney Ashleigh Merchant has sought to prove that Willis and Wade benefited financially from taxpayers' money and should be removed from the case. On Thursday, Willis repeatedly accused Merchant of lying about the details of her relationship with Wade.

""You're confused,"" Willis said. ""You think I'm on trial. These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020.”

Roman has issued new claims saying Wade and Willis' relationship began earlier than they said it had.

Robin Yeartie, a former employee and friend of Willis, said Wade and Willis' relationship began in 2019. Willis says it began in 2021 and that a physical relationship would have not occurred during 2020 because of Wade's cancer diagnosis.

Willis added that the ""physical relationship was over pre-indictment,"" referring to the criminal charges brought against Trump in August last year.

Reiman said Willis had ""very strong body language when it comes to being direct and forthcoming,"" during her testimony.

Similarly, some social media users agreed that Willis appeared confident.

""Fani was a boss lady,"" one user wrote on X. ""She dominated that court room!""

Another user added: ""It's hilarious to watch Laura Ingraham's facial expressions when she realizes that this body language expert is not going to give the narrative that she wants.""

""I don't think that's what Laura wants to hear,"" one user said. ""Too bad.""

But others on social media said they felt Willis' court appearance was not as strong.

""We're witnessing the implosion of Fani Willis,"" one person wrote.

Another person said ""Willis just lost her composure,"" in the court.

Remarkable story about how, when Fani was young, he went to a restaurant, and had an American Express card, and a Visa card, and traveler checks. The waiter refused to take his American Express card. When he tried to hand him a visa, he refused to take that. When he tried to use traveler checks, the waiter refused to take that.  Carrying cash definitely was a decision made because of the racism her father experienced.

Formerly all  local taxes could be deducted for federal taxes; now it’s capped at $10,000, which particularly hurts homeowners in major metropolitan areas — especially in the Northeast and California — where housing tends to be more expensive.

politics,comment,Deductibles,ehml39o,cobaltcigarettes234,,"There you go. Trump has lived up to his word and the hype after all: he is running the country like his businesses. 

Economy's great? Yeah, with a $22 trillion national debt that *someone* (not Trump) will have to pay back. Make great claims, run up a debt, bail, never pay it back. Check.

Tax breaks? Yup... for him and the rest of the wealthy super-minority. He sold a shit product to people, they bought it, it turns out to be more expensive and less useful than he claimed, people get mad, he shrugs, takes the money, repeat. Check.

I will never understand *how* a bunch of the rural population sided with an obviously corrupt billionaire. How did anyone believe that Trump would end corruption when he has been synonymous with decadence, avarice, and gaudiness for decades? Did they think that a man known for greed and wanton ambition would suddenly be a moral and temperate man *as he reached for the most powerful position in America?* How was he going to ""drain the swamp"" by installing leading industrialists in key positions? Did people stop caring about dark money? Or forget the Great Recession?

In any case conservatives, your tax breaks and economic goals are won. You laud and laud Trump for it, ignoring all of the criminality and immorality he displays. In this way, those two 'wins"" are your 30 pieces of silver for continued acceptance of his betrayals. 

Only now you're finding that, just like with other conmen, Trump has got *you* paying forty pieces of silver to get thirty back, and his betrayal is against *you* as well. Congrats to the Party of Judas! You have successfully cut off our nose to spite the face, and I hope this ""winning"" does twice as much to you as you wanted it to do to the ""libs.""  

Edit: damn, posted, went to work, and came back to this. Lol. Thanks for the digital minerals. I would like to clarify a few points. 

1) Up here in Minnesota at least, the rural population overwhelmingly sided with Trump, many live in farm communities. I will take out the farmers part though, because I don't want to misconstrue the truth. Forgive me if it was anecdotal, but that is how it was up here. 

2) One commenter asked about the rhetorical questions and if it indicated a lack of understanding that portends the same misunderstanding that led to Trump's victory. This is a good question. The problem in 2016 was that decades of military fumbles, economic woes, social division, falling education, failing infrastructure had created a sense of unease. We felt that at best America was not living up to her full potential, at worst, we were on the brink. The elites had failed and needed to be replaced. Hillary stood for the elites. 

The problem was that Trump supporters chased the fox from the hen house, but did it by inviting in a grey wolf.

Edit 2: No, Hillary was no saint. My point in my post is this: every time anyone criticizes Trump, *THE MAN WHO ACTUALLY GETS TO DIRECT POLICY, NOT THE PERSON WHO LOST TO HIM*, we are met with non-answers like ""fake news"" (lugenpresse), or ""what about Hillary."" However, we also see ""well the economy is great!"" as if *that* makes up for the following:

* He has imprisoned 12,000 children with no plan of reunion with parents and no govt oversight.


* He backed the Saudis with Kashoggi's death. His administration was trying to sell the Saudis nuclear secrets under the table.


* He initiated a national emergency purely for political capital.

* He abandoned Puerto Rico


* He has deregulated asbestos.


* He has ballooned the debt to $22 trillion.


* He has ignored and repressed climate science.


* He has slandered allies and praised tyrants to the point the rest of the western democratized world views us with suspicion. He even takes the words of dictators over our own intelligence agencies.

* He has left key appointments and offices vacant.

* He has demonstrated a keen disinterest in any actual work that the office holds


* He ended war training in South Korea and has done nothing to stop NK from building more bombs and, in fact said, that he and the dictator were ""in love.""  He even now wants to help grow their economy...of a country with a dictator who demands literal worship.

* He has used his twitter as a bully pulpit.

* Despite his social media tirades, the snowflake-in-chief wants to extend government control over speech against presidents...

* … as long as it offends *him,* he had no problem making Obama's lineage a question for years.

* Despite calls for ""lock her up,"" Trump and his wife...ugh, I mean *daughter* (given what he has said about her, it is so easy to get that confused) have used unprotected cell phones and e-mails.


* Trump openly admitted to committing obstruction on national t.v.


* Trump was caught on tape committing campaign finance fraud.

* Trump is breaking the Emoluments Clause.

* If Cohen is right, Trump needs to be impeached yesterday. Yes, Cohen is a shithead, but that is who Trump employs and surrounds himself with. Consider the hiring of not only Cohen but Manafort, Stone, Flynn, Pruit, Carson, etc. Either this is an accident and he is a *terrible* administrator unworthy of being the chief diplomat and political appointer, or he knowingly surrounds himself with criminals. Many of the things we despise Cohen for, he did *for* Trump or is something akin to something Trump would do.

* He forced his son-in-law through clearance as a blatant play of nepotism.



*These* are what we are accepting for a moderately improved economy.

I hate Trump as much as the next girl,  but the premise of the article is extremely flawed. They shouldn't be looking at how much people ate losing on itemized deductions,  they should be looking at the bottom  how much total tax people are paying. 

The restructuring of the tax code was extreme and has many moving parts beyond the lower standard deduction.  The higher standard deduction, lower rates, and dependent credits have led to reduced total tax for most of my clients, no matter their income. The issue of reduced deductions for tax is an issue for some in  areas with high property or state tax, but it is actually more of an issue for the upper and upper middle class.

The article also talks about lower refunds, which is a ridiculous measure when deciding the impact of a tax law. A refund is about the accuracy of withholding,  not total tax paid.

politics,comment,Medicare,js94r6i,newfrontier58,,">During her speech at the Turning Point Action Conference in West Palm Beach, Florida, the Georgia congresswoman spoke about welfare programs that were introduced during the Biden and President Lyndon B. Johnson administrations, noting that both Democrats had similar political careers.  
""Lyndon B. Johnson is very similar to Joe Biden....they're both Democrats socialists, Lyndon B. Johnson was the majority leader in the Senate. He was vice president to \[John F.\] Kennedy. Joe \[Biden\] was vice president to \[former President Barack\] Obama,"" she said.  
The GOP lawmaker continued: ""His \[Johnson's\] big socialist programs were the Great Society \[program\]...to address education, medical care, urban problems, rural poverty, transportation, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and welfare, the Office of Economic Opportunity and big labor and labor unions,"" she said, comparing the program to Biden's Build Back Better plan—a spending package that focused on lowering costs for families, improving public education, and expanding Medicare coverage, among other goals.  
Greene said that Johnson expanded on public investments directed towards social infrastructure and environmental programs that was introduced under former President Franklin Roosevelt that now ""Joe Biden is attempting to complete: socialism.""  
""Meanwhile, we are now $32 trillion dollars in debt with record high homelessness, 40-year record inflation, we're losing the U.S. Dollar as the number one world currency. We're losing our freedoms. Our government is one big fat bloated machine and it's killing the American dream...and now we find ourselves on the verge of another pointless foreign war,"" the GOP lawmaker added.  


There's a lot of wrong in here, but but it is fascinating to me just how openly disdainful of anything that helps their own voters they are.

Not only that, but just about everybody has old relatives. Many people have parents that live for a long time. No parent wants to be a financial burden to their children, and no child wants to dragged down by their parents' bills. Again, Medicare and Social Security help people avoid that burden.

Growing old and having old relatives is not a left or right thing; it happens to everybody. We all need help with it. So why would anyone be opposed to it?

politics,comment,Health insurance marketplace,gnjjf6a,page_one,,"> But hey, Biden knows we need a trifecta, so let's add vetoing M4A on his list and chalk it up to him being a quieter a version of Trump as well.

To anyone reading this exchange: Here is an example of dishonesty and misinformation under the guise of progressive politics.

People like this clown like to throw around some quote of Biden saying he would veto Medicare For All, to push some idea that Biden hates giving healthcare to people. But if you actually read the quote in question for yourself, you'll see that Biden said he'd veto it **if it came to his desk without funding.** People like to ignore that part because it doesn't confirm their bias. If a bill calls for massive spending, yet finds no money to spend for it, then it's common sense for that bill to be rejected.

(And this is beside the absurdity that Bernie's Medicare plan is suddenly, somehow, the only possible way to expand access to healthcare in America, even though no other country in the world uses such a system.)

> chalk it up to him being a quieter a version of Trump as well.

And finally, yes, Biden is just Trump lite. That's why Biden has spent the first few weeks of his presidency undoing everything Trump did and signing a slew of progressive orders.",2021-02-15T15:39:33+00:00

politics,comment,healthcare,iv5wckr,Geri-psychiatrist-RI,,"Physician here-I agree we need a single payer system. This is the only way to reduce healthcare costs. I won’t even get into the ethics of having employer paid insurance which is also terrible, but basically if people really are concerned about healthcare costs this is the way to do it. 

Bit of a rant here:  because of how fractured the system is there is so much waste. For instance healthcare administration cost is ridiculous. Needing to order duplicate tests (especially when it’s urgent and you can’t wait for records to get to you) drive up costs. There are also certain treatments that decrease cost overall, but are not properly funded because the entity that would save money is not the entity that pays for it. The lack of access to good preventative care is also a problem. If there was a single payer, then there will be much greater emphasis on prevention of illness. Also how certain treatments are reimbursed needs to change. If conservative management of a problem (for instance a medication) is just as helpful as a procedure (such as surgery) then the treatment should be reimbursed the same. There is not much incentive for surgeons not to do surgery when it pays so much better. There are also many other non-ethical reasons but these are just a few of the cost related reasons.",2022-11-05T15:34:24+00:00

> Sanders promised to introduce a &quot;Medicare for All&quot; proposal once the debate over repealing ObamaCare ended.

> Sen. Steve Daines attached an amendment to one version of the ObamaCare repeal bill Wednesday that would have created a single-payer healthcare system in the U.S. Daines does not support a single-payer system but used the model as a political maneuver.

Let me buy in with the same money i use for insurance today, but get medicare in return.  Also, let's fucking control costs and make pricing transparent and negotiate everybody to the same fucking rates instead of ""you're not covered and thus can't pay this?  here's list price--it's 90% higher than your insurance company would have paid"" bullshit.

but if the D's tried to write a single payer healthcare bill, it would be such a shittily written bill, and be such a shock to the system, that the R's would have a field day complaining about it forever.

if we just do public option, we'll gradually move towards single payer as more and more folks sign up and eventually we'll be there and there will be no shock.

That said, D's should drive Single Payer hard so they can compromise with R's to do public option instead, so the R's feel like they've had a say in the matter.  not that they'd suggest such a thing, but at least it's a negotiating step down for D's.

As a patent holding scientist in biotech, I am also in favor of this. I will give a super basic reason why prices can be so crazy that isn't just ""greed"". It's mostly greed but not only. Here is an example timeline for a drug from the perspective of an inventor and pharma company and some very rough insight into pricing:

2005: Dr. X receives an NIH grant to study gene editing in Sickle Cell Anemia. There's about 180k new cases a year. It's considered to be a rare disease, but not super rare. Rare is ""someone you know may have it"". Very rare is ""someone you know knows someone who has it it"". Ultra rare is ""you came up with a mnemonic for it when you studied it for your boards"". 

2008: Dr. X gets promising results that may apply to this disease and contacts their patent office at the university they work, as all scientists are encouraged to do.

2009: Dr. X writes and drafts a provisional patent application, with the offices help. The university foots the entire legal bill, ultimately owning anywhere from 60-90% of it. Once this provisional patent application is submitted to the patent office, the clock has started on exclusivity. A 20 year non-extendable clock. To compare patent timing with copyright, Steamboat Willie's copyright, the famous Walt Disney Short from 1928, will expire in 2024. 

2010: Once filed, the university puts its interesting tech on the web for investors and pharm to see. 

2011: A big pharma says 'oh wow, this is great, we'd like to invest in it/license it'. Awkward talks occur between people with the same letter degrees from the same twenty institutions but vastly different salaries and life choices (inventors and pharma people). They want to pursue this further! Agreements are made and signed. 

2012: The drug, with tens and tens of millions of dollars is prototyped, developed, tested on animal models. Early studies indicate the mice haven't died! Nice!

2013: The patent, taking priority date from the provisional, is awarded. Clock is still going. 

2014: Phase 1 human trials begin. This involves a medium sized network of places recruiting human participants, each site being paid to recruit a small number of people, with staffing and all the trimmings of safety and monitoring in place. Might cost 10 million (a regular good ol grant is 3-5 million over 5 years so this is not crazy). So far so good.

2018: Phase 2 trials begin. Here, more people are recruited, the cost goes up 10x. Maybe into the hundred(s) of millions of dollars now. 

2020: Phase 3 trials begin, phase 2 results begin to trickle in. Data are promising, costs go up 5x across the country. You submit a paper to New England Journal of Medicine, the most prestigious journal for clinical medicine, on the positive results of this drug. It gets in. The disclosures are replete with equity, sponsored research agreements, consulting and straight pharma dough. They're (the drug company) is paying for the research, after all.

2021: Company examines feasibility of marketing, manufacture, delivery, reimbursement models, efficacy and many more things about getting product to market. Clock is still running. Submit to FDA formally, have many many back and forths. They come up with a terrible name for it, [like what Mike Tyson would answer when asked who his favorite female character on the office is](https://www.rxlist.com/philith-drug.htm).

2023: Phase 3 appears successful. Solidify pricing strategy. Wait for FDA approval while you get a rough idea that it will be approved. Huzzah! They approve. Likely at least until next year until you have a patient paying for it. 

2024: First patient receives the drug, and, most importantly, first insurance reimbursement of the drug.  

You now have five years (until 2029) left before you lose exclusivity. Patents are not a secret ingredient, and other companies will secretly making sure the nanosecond the patent expires they can be ready with an alternative. You think about charging between 1-3m for the cost of the drug which is absolutely outrageous. But you've easily sunk perhaps billions into getting to this point. This chart may be totally off but it should be a rough estimate of why, once that patent is filed, it's a race to do with a drug what you can for whatever cost you want. And drug companies can be and usually are super evil, but they have the capital and infrastructure to see things reach patient hands or arms. The only time the government paid for this research was that first non-trivial initial grant (and perhaps grants in between, but still small potatoes). They bought you your first drum kit, now you're playing Wembley. 

This is in no way a defense, and I'm sure I'm off about some things, but this is not too crazy a scenario. Drugs are still crazy expensive and pharma companies as greedy as they come. But the huge amount of R&D that goes into it is not trivial. They want to recoup expenses which is fair, but have done so aggressively and at the expense of people in need of drugs.

NeutralPolitics,post,Affordable Care Act,5y10xw,haalidoodi,House Republicans revealed their proposed replacement for the Affordable Care Act yesterday. What are its pros and cons?,"**[Link to full bill](https://housegop.leadpages.co/healthcare/)**

Yesterday, House Republicans released the full text of the bill they hope will fulfill the ""replace"" part of their ""repeal and replace"" policy with regards to Obamacare. The 123 page bill contains [the following major changes](http://www.vox.com/2017/3/6/14829526/american-health-care-act-gop-replacement): 

* The individual mandate is removed.  Instead insurers can charge people who have had a 2 month coverage gap up to 130% of normal prices.

* Keeps guaranteed issue and community rating, though age bands permitted are wider.

* Medicaid expansion stops taking new people in 2020.


* Medicaid becomes ""per-capita block granted""

* The ban on discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is preserved

* Children can still stay on their parents' coverage until age 26

The plan has already been [criticized](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/gop-s-obamacare-replacement-plan-faces-four-big-obstacles-n730001) on a number of grounds, with many GOP lawmakers [already stating](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/conservatives-revolt-against-gop-obamacare-repeal-replacement/518775/) they oppose it. Criticisms range from it keeping too much of Obamacare's architecture, merely tweaking it rather than properly replacing it, while the left has accused it of favoring the wealthy and not addressing major issues with healthcare in the US.

**Is the new bill viable as an alternative to Obamacare? A solution to America's healthcare issues? Who currently supports and opposes it, and whose support is still needed?**

Found this infographic on NY Times (sorry for mobile link) detailing what they believe are the major changes to the original ACA policy. In my opinion, the biggest things to note would be the following: repealing the individual and employer mandate, changing the restrictions on charging older Americans (originally older Americans could only be charged 3 times as much as younger ones, now they can be charged 5 times as much and those ratios can now be changes by individual states), and keeping the pre-existing conditions policy and the prohibitions on insurance limits.

It accentuates the parts of Obamacare's architecture which work poorly, reduces or eliminates parts which work well, and as far as I can tell offers no coherent architecture or vision for what it's trying to accomplish.

* **Accentuating the bad parts of Obamacare**

The biggest political shot against Obamacare is that it pushes many people with moderate to low incomes onto plans which have [high premiums, high deductibles, and which provide little more than catastrophic coverage.](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/26/obamacare-deductibles-are-on-the-rise-for-2017-along-with-monthly-premiums.html)

This plan does a lot to make that problem worse.  On page 45 of the bill, it repeals the cost-sharing subsidy.  This is [a program](http://www.healthreformbeyondthebasics.org/cost-sharing-charges-in-marketplace-health-insurance-plans-part-2/) in Obamacare which provides a reduction in deductibles and copays to people making less than 250% of the poverty line.  Removing this will mean that even if the tax credits in the new bill are enough to buy a bare bones plan, the out of pocket costs of such a plan would be ludicrously large in comparison to most people's income and the insurance would provide very little financial protection from insolvency.

Additionally, a major problem in Obamacare has been gaming of the insurance system to just get coverage when you're sick.  [The Obama administration had to make a lot of changes to make it harder to enroll outside of the annual enrollment period because of gaming the system due to the too-low mandate penalty.](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-09-01/patients-are-still-playing-games-with-obamacare)  The system of allowing enrollment with a 130% premium for one year is an open invitation to gaming the system by just buying insurance if you get an expensive illness.  With no ongoing penalty, and with the if-you-do-get-sick penalty being just 3.6 months of premiums, it makes eminent financial sense for people with no ongoing costs to drop out of the market, making it [death spiral.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_spiral_\(insurance\))


* **Removing the good parts of Obamacare**

By far the most successful thing in Obamacare has been the medicaid expansion.  Even after it was made optional by the Supreme Court in [*NFIB v. Sebelius*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/11-393) it has [been very successful at reducing uninsured rates](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-08-05/medicaid-expansion-states-have-seen-success-reducing-number-of-uninsured) and [medicaid recipients are happier with their coverage than exchange enrollees.](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/24/high-satisfaction-levels-with-obamacare-as-2017-prices-emerge.html)

By ending that expansion in 2020, the bill is removing the one part of Obamacare which has been a pretty good success.

Additionally, the plan is much more regressive than Obamacare, and the tax credits appear far too stingy for especially older people with low incomes to afford coverage.

The [Urban Institute](http://www.urban.org/urban-wire/under-aca-replacement-health-insurance-options-middle-and-low-income-people-would-shrink?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=organic&utm_medium=social&utm_term=aca_replacement&utm_content=urban_wire) estimates that on average plans under this proposal which were paid for entirely by the tax credit would have:

>[A] $15,000 deductible for single coverage, a $30,000 deductible for family coverage, and $25,000 single/$50,000 family out-of-pocket maximums.  The policy would cover generic drugs only and would exclude outpatient mental health and substance use disorder services, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and rehabilitation services.

That is hardly insurance at all.  If you were too poor to pay substantial premiums above the subsidy, you would be left with insurance which had deductibles which were multiples of your annual income - that is to say which is almost completely useless.

* **No coherent architecture**

Nobody who takes healthcare policy seriously and doesn't work for an involved party seems to think this plan makes any sense. [Ezra Klein](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/6/14838122/republican-health-bill-obamacare-replacement) from the left and [Avik Roy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2017/03/07/house-gops-obamacare-replacement-will-make-coverage-unaffordable-for-millions-otherwise-its-great/#3ae55f4437fd) from the right both think the plan is deeply flawed.  There's no rhyme or reason to this.  Obamacare was a deeply debated plan which rested on a  [three legged stool of subsidies, the mandate, and guaranteed issue/community rating](https://internalmedicineblog.jamainternalmed.com/2014/05/15/the-affordable-care-act-part-3-the-three-legged-stool/)  This plan just seems to arbitrary hack at those legs while still planning for them to hold weight.

NeutralPolitics,comment,Affordable Care Act,demdibh,Serenikill,,"One thing you didn't mention in your bullet points is that subsidies are removed and replaced with individual tax credits, which are based on income and age. It sounds like the tax credits may cover more people but with less of a break for those that need it.

> A 61-year old could make up to $115,000 and still receive some credit.

The problem I have with tax credits is that they only help at the end of the year, so if you are living paycheck to paycheck the credit doesn't help you at all.

Additionally I don't like or see the point giving a tax break on health care to somebody who makes 6 figures.

Edit: Did a little more digging on the tax credits proposed in the bill. They are ""Advanceable, refundable tax credits."" which as far as I can tell exactly the same thing that the ACA created. So really they are just changing how the subsidy works.

I also don't think medicaid block grants are a great idea. The main issue with them, even with the per capita adjustments, is that the money doesn't adjust to the actual patient needs. If health care costs change rapidly, due to a new drug or anything else, there won't be enough money to cover that. Basically if it saves money its at the cost of people on medicaid, and if doesn't save money what is the point?

Overall I don't see how the bill addresses the main issue with US healthcare, which is rising costs. Really the only way to fix the issue is to get more and more healthy people into the system. I don't think insurance costing a little more down the line is going to fix that.

NeutralPolitics,comment,Affordable Care Act,demehkq,yoyodude64,,"I'm going to address your bullet points in order - 

1) The individual mandate did come across as an undue burden for those who fell in the gap of too high an income for Medicaid, but too low to truly be able to afford health insurance. Having said that, you do need young, healthy individuals paying into a health plan to help offset the losses attributable to older, higher risk individuals who will have a higher utilization rate. This is why the income-based rather than age-based incentives don't make much sense to me, as they seem to discriminate against the precise people you want to be a part of the risk pool - healthy, recent college graduates working in lower paying jobs. http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/the-cost-of-the-individual-mandate-penalty-for-the-remaining-uninsured/

2) I don't know as much about this so I'll set someone else chime in, but I will say that wider age bands have been shown to be better for the system.

3) This looks to be a way to slowly phase out Medicaid over time, which would not be ideal for low-income or other eligible Americans who rely on Medicaid for health coverage. Medicaid costs are likely to skyrocket as the ratio of people paying in vs taking out continues to shift towards Medicaid becoming an even larger funding drain, but limiting coverage isn't an effective way of managing costs. Additionally, as payouts from Medicaid continue to drop, more and more physicians will not bother taking these programs, leading to low-income individuals having trouble even accessing the health care they need, let alone figuring out how to pay for it. Perhaps we should let government programs negotiate drug prices instead, something that I believe Trump has discussed in the past. https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/us/politics/half-of-doctors-listed-as-serving-medicaid-patients-are-unavailable-investigation-finds.html , https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2014/02/01/as-obamacare-brings-patients-doctors-not-warm-to-medicaid/#3457689e75f3 , https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-01-26/trump-says-he-would-let-medicare-negotiate-drug-prices

4) Block grants are a conservative way of under-funding government programs while looking like they're simply looking out for states' rights. They can say ""oh, we gave X amount of money, this should be enough for the state if it's managed correctly."" The issues here are that states often don't allocate these resources efficiently (either due to corruption or just not knowing how) and once the money runs out, patients are screwed. Also, even if funding is allocated efficiently, it's easy to look at a sum provided to a state (say, $10 billion for the year) and say ""that's a lot of money."" But what if a state really needs $14 billion? Too bad. It's simply a way to transfer the risk (and future blame) to the states while saying you're letting states decide for themselves how to handle the money, since they should theoretically know the needs of their constituents better. http://khn.org/news/block-grants-medicaid-faq/ 

5 and 6) I'm lumping these together because they represent holdovers from Obamacare and are the least controversial in my opinion. Paul Ryan, Trump, and other Republicans say they don't want to take away coverage from people currently covered, and they can't take these away without clearly breaking that promise. Taking these away would be a non-starter, so it's good to see that Republicans understand this.

The [ACA](https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/about-the-law/) was created to control healthcare costs by expanding insurance coverage (through Medicaid expansion and the individual mandate + insurance marketplace), and to tie healthcare costs to patient outcomes by changing how Medicare pays doctors. 

Its [provisions include](http://kff.org/health-reform/fact-sheet/summary-of-the-affordable-care-act/): limits on age rating, pre-existing condition protection, staying on parents' policies up to age 26, cost-sharing subsidies, and contraceptive coverage. Congress can repeal the following provisions through budget reconciliation: medicaid expansion, premium subsidies, and the employer and individual mandates. This is where most Congressional Republican replacement proposals have focused their efforts. 

The current front-runners for GOP replacements appear to be:

* Paul Ryan's [A Better Way](https://abetterway.speaker.gov/_assets/pdf/ABetterWay-HealthCare-PolicyPaper.pdf) 

* Orrin Hatch's [Patient CARE Act](http://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/The%20Patient%20Choice,%20Affordability,%20Responsibility,%20and%20Empowerment%20Act.pdf)

* Tom Price's [Empowering Patients First Act](http://tomprice.house.gov/sites/tomprice.house.gov/files/HR%202300%20Empowering%20Patients%20First%20Act%202015.pdf)

Some common components of these plans include re-regulating the individual market to make premiums cheaper for younger individuals (by offering less benefits) and more expensive for older ones, protecting pre-existing conditions if continuous coverage is maintained, offering high-risk pools as a safety-net, changing Medicaid funding, and capping the tax-exclusion for insurance through employers.

1) How effective might the elements of these plans be with regards to creating affordable premiums, encouraging insurance companies to offer competitive plans, and reducing the underinsure population?

NeutralPolitics,comment,ACA,dc1qh6k,Artful_Dodger_42,,"I actually just posted this in another thread, but I think it would fit great here (and probably get more responses):

I've been looking at [comparisons of different health care systems in other countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system#International_comparisons), and the Japan model is standing out to me.


Japan has the lowest per capita expenditure on health, lowest healthcare costs as a percentage of GDP, and a lower % of government revenue spent on health. And yet, for all this, they have the highest life expectancy and the lowest infant mortality rate.

Setting aside the argument of big government vs small government for now, let's focus on what is most effective for our expenditure of tax dollars.

[Looking more closely at Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system_in_Japan), here is a brief summary of their health care model:

> The health care system in Japan provides healthcare services, including screening examinations, prenatal care and infectious disease control, with the patient accepting responsibility for 30% of these costs while the government pays the remaining 70%. Payment for personal medical services is offered by a universal health care insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. All residents of Japan are required by the law to have health insurance coverage. People without insurance from employers can participate in a national health insurance program, administered by local governments. Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice and cannot be denied coverage. Hospitals, by law, must be run as non-profit and be managed by physicians. For-profit corporations are not allowed to own or operate hospitals. Clinics must be owned and operated by physicians.


From what I can tell, Japan has arguably one of the most efficient health care systems in the world. I can hear the 'socialist' catcalls now, but my inner fiscal conservative is warring with my small government self, and wants to stop paying so much for health care.

Now, there are other health care systems out there that have a mixture of private and government health insurance. [Sweden has an excellent, stable track record of providing healthcare using such a method. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Sweden)

NeutralPolitics,comment,ACA,dc24ivg,JohnnyMnemo,,"Any plan that doesn't manage the costs of healthcare will fail.

The ACA failed to do that, and it's why it's failing now.

Any attempt at mandatory or subsidized insurance will simply allow healthcare costs to rise, to suck up the mandated or subsidized funds flowing through insurance.

It's really pretty elementary economics.

Managing the cost for an inelastic demand like healthcare requires top-down cost control, and if there's a way to do that without mandates and regulation from the government I can't imagine it.  The GOP has traditionally been loathe for governmental regulation of this sort.  Therefore they appear to be fundamentally opposed to any kind of universal healthcare that would actually work.

The only way that I can see that the GOP could manage healthcare without controlling the cost element is to make the demand elastic, which IOW would mean with holding care from those unable to pay.  If you remove the inelastic demand, costs should go down to meet the market level that can pay for them.  Of course, that means letting poor sick people die.

If what /u/vlasvilneous says is correct about Hatch's plan, in capping premium rates for some tier of individuals is correct, it could help.  But only if that insurance has to be accepted by providers;  otherwise they'll simply refuse to accept those patients at that level of coverage due to reduced payments to the providers from a ""cut-rate"" insurance.

And again, if the US Government makes up the underpayment to providers with subsidies, then you again have the same problems that ACA has:  healthcare costs will continue to rise, and the USG will have exceedingly large bills to pay.

The only feasible answer is single payer, which will mandate a top-down pay rate for providers.  Like, you know, Medicare.  But that's socialist, almost by definition, and therefore unlikely to be enacted by this administration.

The GOP is in a real pickle.

NeutralPolitics,comment,ACA,dc1i1o1,None,,"Paul Ryan's plan is to get people to open a healthcare only savings account, with high deductibles (meaning your savings account gets drained pretty quickly), making older people pay more, making chronic people pay more, and getting rid of lawsuits against companies that have fucked over patients.

The only good thing was something Obama wanted in the ACA, the ability to allow insurance across state lines, which increases competition.

Orrin Hatch's plan is to punish those that have not had health care coverage for 18 months or more through higher premiums, keep pre-existing a thing, make it so that older people can pay more (currently there is a limit on how much Insurance companies can charge) by eliminating the limit.  Allowing for a one time ""forgiveness"" when the plan is enacted. Abolish medicaid/medicare, Keep everything within the states, and of course... malpractice reform ( much like Ryan's plan).

Tom Price is a mix of both, HSAs, no inter-state exchanges, but again.. malpractice reform.

**Answering your questions**

1)Affordable premiums doesnt seem to be addressed by anyone but Hatch.  He wants to set a 300% limit from the mimimum wage (~$35,000 in 2014). This means that if you make under 300%, you get some money back or deductions. However, for an individual making over that, it was about 1.5k/month. I dont know how that is any better than what we have now, in fact it is much worse.

I didnt see anything that would limit premiums, except that they would be higher for people that were older.  I am not a fan of this, it feels like ""what is the point? Why not just put that money in a savings account at this point?""  it actually feels like they are molding it to start arguing in that direction... ""why even have health insurance? Ill just save it"", the Social Security argument.

2)  I dont know of any country that relied on this method, HSAs are not anything that will benefit consumers at all.  Removing the ability to sue doctors for malpractice seems an ignorant move, for that is the only control patients have to keep doctors at high quality levels.  They have not introduced a way to replace that check and balance. As it is now, we have no recourse when we go into a doctors office, and pay them for the privilege of the first visit. If we dont get what we needed, dont like them, etc... we still pay.  Seems counter intuitive, especially if you find an incompetent doctor.  BTW, you cant even complain about them in any meaningful sense.

3) Policies that would address cost would be those related to drug companies (they can say they have increased costs on getting drugs to the market all they want, they are earning a LOT of money even WITH their ""increased costs""), hospitals gouging people and the government, and insurance companies that are also making record earnings.

The entire system needs a revamp and there doesnt seem to be anyone willing to go up against these groups that give so much to our Congresspeople.  I dont see it happening until we get corporate money out of DC.",2017-01-05T18:36:19+00:00

I'd like to note some other aspects of the ACA, because they never seem to be talked about and at least some of them are important and are not included under the Republican replacement plans I've seen.

Here is a [summary](http://obamacarefacts.com/summary-of-provisions-patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act/) to provisions in the ACA, and links to [the actual bill](https://www.healthcare.gov/where-can-i-read-the-affordable-care-act/).


1. The ACA closes the Medicare Part D ""donut hole"" (the elderly will pay less for prescriptions).

2. The ACA caps out-of-pocket annual costs on patients (to limit costs borne by a patient and presumably lead to fewer bankruptcies). 

3. The ACA mandates coverage of preventive health care (assuming that preventive care reduces costs later when disease is further developed).

4. The ACA creates a uniform standard for policies, making it easier to compare policies (grouping by using metallic levels makes it easier for consumers to know what is in each plan).

5. The ACA establishes a medical loss ratio with the intention of ensuring that more money from premiums goes to direct health care costs (if an insurer spends less than 80% of premiums on health care, they must reimburse the consumer).

6. The ACA requires that health insurance premium increases be approved by the states, rather than left solely to the discretion of health insurers.

7. The ACA cuts costs to the Medicare program.

8. The ACA provides for ""[experiments](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2013/12/02/247216805/three-ways-obamacare-is-changing-how-a-hospital-cares-for-patients)"" aiming to find ways to control costs, including [accountable care organizations](http://khn.org/news/aco-accountable-care-organization-faq/?gclid=Cj0KEQiAnb3DBRCX2ZnSnMyO9dIBEiQAOcXYHwHl5rvXOfmJaDdlaD2AFCM9fgptgsAWRv_EDwB7ttEaAsx38P8HAQ) (ACOs). 


9. The ACA [changes the way health care is delivered](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhpr1503614?af=R&rss=currentIssue#t=article) (aimed at reducing readmissions and hospital-acquired infections, and basing pay on quality rather than quality).



All of these things go away with ACA repeal, unless included in the new Republican plan. The ACA's tendrils are in all aspects of our health care, and in my opinion, Republicans seem to be overestimating the possibility of clean repeal and replace.

I suspect that the eventual Republican plan will include at least 85% of what is already in the ACA. They’ll repeal Obamacare and replace it with basically the same thing, then give it a different name (Trumpcare?). And then they will claim that they saved the health care system.

In 2006 two Senators, a Republican and a Democrat in the Senate proposed a relatively radical healthcare reform plan. Basically, it would tax employers between 1 and 20% based on size, and apply those taxes toward credits for people to buy insurance under a mandate. It would also bring Medicaid and other funds into this system. Then, everyone could use that money to buy their own insurance, and the subsidy would be enough to buy relatively decent health insurance. 

http://www.cbpp.org/research/an-examination-of-the-wyden-bennett-health-reform-plan

It would basically move all health insurance away from employer-provided and towards state exchanges, with money to make sure every American can have private insurance.

If the Republicans have any courage and want to come out the winners on healthcare, I would argue this is the plan they should pick.",2017-01-05T22:44:03+00:00

Its similar to Japan, but a somewhat new cost control measure are one-off payments for all treatments. That is to say, a hospital gets x dollars for y sickness - and if the patients care is more expensive, the hospital pays the difference out of pocket. If a treatment is cheaper, the hospital gets to keep the difference. Coupled with a high percentage of non profit, state run hospitals and highly quality and cost controlled private hospitals, it seems like something that could work in the us.

Still, the government foots a high percentage of operating costs of hospitals, but that differs between regions.

Our deductibles are also a lot lower than in the us, and the actually enforced individual mandate (as in if you don't have insurance, the government will sign you up, and if you don't pay, they will drag you to the equivalent of small claims court).

It's one of the most expensive health care systems in the world, but that is to be explained by huge salaries nationwide, and all around high cost of living. GDP wise, according to Wikipedia, it's slightly less than in Germany and a whooping 6 percentage points less than in the us.

Also our basic health insurance is non profit - no company can earn a dime on it (although they can sell extra insurances on top of that).

My health insurance did not cover any health issues in Japan so I was prepared for a bad experience, but it went better than I thought it would. 

1) showed up to emergency room, in line behind 40-60 other people. Registered. 

2) watch as all in queue in front of me are processed in to see a doctor in ~40 minutes. Then it's my turn

3) Doctor speaks fluent English extremely well. Sees me for 10 minutes. Orders an electrocardiogram and chest X-ray. I ask how much this will cost as I have no insurance in Japan. Doc says not to worry. I still am worried but proceed to get the tests done. 

4) x-ray is first. Film is taken with 5 minutes of arrival. Other patients also through the process quickly. When I exit exam room nurse is waiting to take film back to doctor. Tech hands film to nurse and nurse escorts me to next test. 

5) electrocardiogram taken immediately. As I exit exam, nurse is back to take results, and me, back to doctor. 

6) doctor agrees I need antibiotics. Tells me to pay at the cashier and they will give me prescription. I go to pay, expecting the worst. 

7) cashier approaches my wife and I apologizing profusely. Says she has never seen a bill this high. She truly looks very sorry and scared for us. She shows us the bill, clearly anticipating an argument or some kind of bad reaction.  Bill is for ¥7500, or $75. American. I happily pay it. She gives us prescription. 

8) at pharmacy, again 35 people in line in front of me, all processed within 10 minutes. Clerk calls us over. Very apologetic. Says she has never seen a bill this high and tried to lower it. She can't. ¥3500, or $35. American. I pay. 

The whole experience took an hour and 15 minutes and cost $110. American. 

Short note: Drug that I was given is an antibiotic developed by a Japanese company and still unapproved for use in the USA, apparently because it would threaten sales for something called a Z-pack here in the US. Or so I was told by my brother in law, an instructor for Tokyo SWAT. Ok, that last bit might not be factual, but it is what he told me.

NeutralPolitics,comment,Universal healthcare,dpnani3,Eudaimonics,,"There's few main issues with the American system.

* When the uninsured have a medical emergency, they are charged with an astronomical bill, that most would never be paid off. These defaults on medical debt is then passed on to the consumers with insurance, raising costs. To add insult to injury, many of these medical emergencies could have been prevented with preventive care.
* Health insurance companies sole purpose is to negotiate rates and prices for services and medicine between you and the health service providers. It's a costly middleman.
* Employers dictate the quality of insurance you have. You really don't have any freedom as if you buy your own policy, it is going to be much more expensive (one of the issues with Obamacare), unless you make below a certain amount. Relying/requiring on employers to provide health policies is also pretty anti-business and adds to labor costs.

A Universal Medicaid system solves all of these problems by providing a very competitive public option.

The downside of course is the collapse of ~70 percent of the private healthcare insurance industry which employs over half a million Americans. To be fair, with the savings from health insurance, this will likely be spent in other industries, raising employment there.

The only other system I see working is giving consumers waaaay more leverage when negotiating with healthcare facilities directly. I'm not sure what this system looks like, just an idea. The downside is still the same.",2017-11-11T01:00:53+00:00

NeutralPolitics,comment,Universal healthcare,dppdrce,Brokerib,,"US health care falls short on a number of measures. Check out this link for recent analysis against the top 10 - http://www.commonwealthfund.org/interactives/2017/july/mirror-mirror/

From the linked article - *the U.S. health care system falls short, failing to deliver indicated services reliably to all who could benefit. In particular, poor access to primary care has contributed to inadequate prevention and management of chronic diseases, delayed diagnoses, incomplete adherence to treatments, wasteful overuse of drugs and technologies, and coordination and safety problems.*

The long and short of it is that the health care in the US is more expensive and less effective than almost any other developed nation.

Interestingly, the top three performers globally all achieved their outcomes in a different way, and only one of them falls clearly into the form of *socialized healthcare* you describe above.

And all of them do it at around half the GDP expenditure of the US system.

**The three countries with the best overall health system performance scores have strikingly different health care systems. All three provide universal coverage and access, but do so in different ways, suggesting that high performance can be achieved through a variety of payment and organizational approaches.**

**Experts generally group universal coverage systems into three categories: Beveridge systems, single-payer systems, and multipayer systems. These three systems are represented among our highest performers.**

THE U.K.’S NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE

**The Beveridge model takes its name from the creator of Britain’s modern welfare state, William Beveridge. In the NHS, initiated by Aneurin Bevan in 1948, health services are paid for through general tax revenue, as opposed to insurance premiums. Furthermore, the government plays a significant role in organizing and operating the delivery of health care. For example, most hospitals are publicly owned, and the specialists who work in them are often government employees. This is not true of all providers. Most general practitioner practices are privately owned. Health care in the U.K. and other Beveridge countries is centrally directed and has more direct management accountability to the government than in other health systems.**

AUSTRALIA’S SINGLE-PAYER INSURANCE PROGRAM

**In Australia, everyone is covered under the public insurance plan, Medicare. Much like the NHS, Australia’s Medicare is funded through tax revenue. Medicare is distinguished, though, by lesser public involvement in care delivery. Many Australian hospitals are private, and roughly half the population purchases private health insurance to access care outside the public system. To put into an American context, Australia’s Medicare resembles Medicare in the U.S.**

NETHERLAND’S COMPETING PRIVATE INSURERS

**Unlike Australia and the U.K., the Dutch health system relies on private insurers to fund health services for its population. Dutch insurers are mainly financed through community-rated premiums and payroll taxes, which are pooled and then distributed to insurers based on the risk profile of their enrollees. All plans include a standard basic benefit package; subsidies are available for people with low incomes; adults are required to enroll in a plan or must pay a fine. Dutch health care providers are predominantly private. This multipayer system—partly inspired by the managed competition model—shares many similarities with the insurance marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act.**",2017-11-12T12:18:00+00:00
NeutralPolitics,comment,Universal healthcare,dqbswe6,mormagils,,"If the four countries you highlighted, none of them have a massive public health concern and all of them have functioning, affluent economies. So I would label all four of them effective, sure. 

But I’m guessing you’re looking for a more comparative analysis to consider reforms of the current US health care system. So I’ll discuss the advantages that the UK, Canada, and Denmark bring to the system, as well as the challenges for adapting to US. 

The UK is probably the most well-known example of universal healthcare among US voters. It has been around for many, many years and is part of one of the world’s biggest economies and the US’s strongest ally. In recent years, the NHS has been one of the biggest political issues in the UK, as it has become very expensive. Many of the UK’s recent immigration restrictions have been related to the NHS, and over the years has become more privatized and less universal in several ways. That said, it is FAR more universal than the US still. 

Canada has a smaller economy and a more universal system than the NHS—there are few if any distinctions between Canadian citizens and immigrants, unlike the UK. Both the UK and the US have a much, much greater population of immigrants than Canada, however. Canada’s healthcare system seems to be very well liked by everyone in Canada, though I have heard US critics claim potentially high wait times. Neither UK not Canadian sources seem all that coerced about this. 

Denmark, like most of the Scandinavian countries, has a very high median income and happiness index, as well as one of the most universal healthcare systems there is. Yet Denmark also has a minuscule economy compared to the US, a much smaller population, more homogeneous population, and far less immigration. This matters because it is an open question how well Denmark’s system could scale with a more multinational, larger, more diverse economy and culture. 

So the problem with healthcare is that there’s no great way to measure how well different systems will adapt. The UK and US are most similar, and the UK has recently had to privatize the NHS in some ways and has struggled with high immigrant populations. The UK is confident the system is still good at its core and these changes are not significant signs of the future, but critics in the US are less convinced. There no real way to prove one way or another. 

Of course, the UK isn’t the only example, and globally the record for universal healthcare is quite strong. However, the criticism that increased scale magnifies the problems of a universal system is a fair point. It does not automatically mean universal systems cannot succeed in the US, just that there is no clear period on one side or another. 

It is complicated by the US issues happening right now. Obamacare was not nearly the promise from the campaign. It did provide healthcare to millions more Americans, which is good, but it also raised prices significantly for middle class, younger Americans, which is already a group that was feeling economic pressure. This group was also supposedly a huge part of the coalition that elected Obama in the first place, which means that Obama’s landmark bill, which was supposed to be a ringing endorsement and great victory on the path to universal healthcare, was instead a tepid experiment that highlighted problems of scale. 

Of course, Obamacare was overall still a success and still has the support of the majority of voters. But it didn’t really make the discussion any less complicated. ",2017-11-25T19:17:32+00:00

Another problem with the national health programs in Europe is rationing of care leading to long wait times and worse outcomes. The US has some of the highest cancer screening rates and cancer is usually caught earlier in the US than in Canada for example. The US also has the shortest wait times for any given procedure, especially non-urgent care like orthopedic surgery. There is quicker and better access to new treatments in the US than socialized healthcare systems.

#DEFINITIONS

**Socialized Healthcare**: A system where the healthcare^* of all citizens is paid for exclusively by the government.

*Likely not including all medical services, as most legislation ([such as Canada's](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/health-care-system/canada-health-care-system-medicare/canada-health-act-frequently-asked-questions.html#a5)) that are usually [considered universal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_universal_health_care).

**Effective**: Is the value (quality of life improvements gained from the medical procedures made available) per expenditure (financial, bureaucratic, government power precedent, all kinds) greater than available alternatives (the current U.S. system, other foreign non-universal systems, proposals being made by the current U.S. congress, etc.).

NeutralPolitics,comment,Universal healthcare,dpmjq82,None,,"I think you need to define your question better. Effective at *what*? Both types of systems claim to be effective. One claims effectiveness by rewarding innovators and getting the best possible care to the market and letting those who most need it pay for it. Everyone gets care that provides a marginal value to the business that created the technology or to the doctors themselves. Plus, there's a big safety net and other various paths for people to get that care.

On the flipside, the other system claims to get care to more people -- more simply and more cheaply. What is lost in the entrepreneurial aspect of medicine? That is what is most up for debate, I think. All of these other arguments are missing the major conflict.",2017-11-10T16:30:37+00:00

NeutralPolitics,comment,Universal healthcare,dpmteap,Alcuev,,"I don't know much about outcomes and effectiveness of treatment, but in terms of expenditure, there is a strong argument that healthcare spending in the US is proportional to consumer spending behavior generally. By this argument, healthcare in the US is not ""more expensive"" because of higher costs per capita or private profits, but because the people are willing to spend more for the care they want more.

This argument that degree of health care expenditure is based on consumption habits is made in excruciating detail by [this blog post](https://randomcriticalanalysis.wordpress.com/2016/09/25/high-us-health-care-spending-is-quite-well-explained-by-its-high-material-standard-of-living/) from Random Critical Analysis (cited by Tyler Cowen in [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-20/spending-a-lot-on-health-care-is-the-american-way)).

RE your definition of value per expenditure - it's almost impossible to calculate the counterfactual here, and I haven't seen much data in the comments to suggest what would happen in any given country if its healthcare policies changed. You can't just use poor health outcomes in the US as evidence that the healthcare system is poor or worse than others, because the demographics are different and Americans face diverse health challenges that are not the same as smaller homogeneous (EG European) countries.

It's also not clear what jurisdictional level to administer universal healthcare at; for the US, should it be national or by state? The public debate is generally about national universal healthcare, but it may be more viable or effective to administer healthcare at the state level because the economic demographics vary so wildly across the country (+ constitutional reasons). It's maybe even sensible to draw jurisdictional lines between people living in urban vs rural areas.",2017-11-10T19:19:18+00:00

NeutralPolitics,post,Single-payer system,69mp0z,huadpe,What is the policy viability of a US state implementing a universal or single-payer healthcare system?,"With the current debate over the future of [the ACA](http://www.healthline.com/health/consumer-healthcare-guide/how-does-the-affordable-care-act-work#2) and the Republican-proposed [AHCA,](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/what-we-know-about-the-american-health-care-act/525426/) there has been discussion around the idea of one or more states implementing universal healthcare systems on a state level.

There is currently [legislation in California](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-single-payer-healthcare-20170426-story.html) regarding a statewide single-payer system.  Vermont had between 2010 and 2014 worked on creating such a program, [but abandoned the project in 2014.](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1501050#t=article)

This model would parallel the manner in which Canada's single payer system was developed, which [began in Saskatchewan as a single province's hospital insurance scheme,](http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/healthc.pdf) and, despite [significant pushback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan_doctors%27_strike) at the time, it eventually became the model which was adopted by all Canadian provinces.

So, what is the viability of copying the Canadian model by a US state?  In particular, what sort of a tax scheme would be necessary to support it, and what incentives would it give providers and patients?",2017-05-06T18:24:04+00:00

The short answer is that there are too many parties with vested interests in the current system,  and too many people with more fear of change than discomfort with their current plans to allow wholesale change to single payer.  Perhaps incremental change is possible. 

Personally, I wonder if one way to get there would be to allow people to opt into Medicare by paying for it with their own taxes.  This allows the expansion to be market driven and tax neutral.  People can choose single payer if the cost benefit ratio works for them.",2017-05-06T19:27:31+00:00
NeutralPolitics,comment,Single-payer system,dh7xtzu,lux514,,"From what I have gathered, changing the ""system"" is missing the point. It might be viable, but the question of who pays for healthcare isn't the biggest issue we face. 

The debate is often motivated by ideological prejudice for/against the private sector/government. However, there is considerable evidence concerning some changes that could lead to significant improvement, without getting into the ideological battle or overhauling the whole system. Neither single payer, nor the free market is a magic bullet. The problems are too diverse and too messy.

 A recent [article](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/21/health/gop-health-care-debate-vital-directions-report/index.html) covers a recent [report](https://nam.edu/initiatives/vital-directions-for-health-and-health-care/) by a large group of experts, who list various solutions to healthcare.  Like the current debate in the GOP, single payer misses the point. 

**TL;DR: Solving healthcare requires letting experts get to work to untangle a great many details in order to bring down costs and improve health outcomes. These things will need to be done, regardless of what ""system"" we have, and will vastly improve healthcare much more than ideologically motivated fixations about single payer or small government.**

The good news is, these should be things we can find common ground on, if we give up our search for the white whale of our preferred system.

The report covers a large amount of issues and details.  To summarize some main examples of pragmatic changes that I've gathered:

Eliminate perverse incentives for providers to give as much medication and procedures as possible. We should pay for results, not for each individual service.

Update data collection and communication to make care more efficient between providers.

Be healthier. Combat pollution, addiction, and  obesity. Healthcare intersects with many other issues.

[Talk about death.](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721371-death-inevitable-bad-death-not-how-have-better-death)  A large portion of expenses occur near the end of life.  But most people simply don't want that much care if they're facing the inevitable.  People want to go home to die.  It's a somewhat morbid truth that this would [save a significant amount of money.](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/02/28/283444163/episode-521-the-town-that-loves-death) But evidence shows that people prefer this kind of death, but aren't guided to make their decisions clear. Yes, ""death panels"" that help do this are (still) a great idea.

There's really a lot more than I [edit]cannot talk about competently here, much less in a stump speech. As we should *all* know by now, healthcare is complicated.

I don't believe single payer should be considered viable, if the goal is to most effectively reduce costs and improve health outcomes. There are just too many other problems to address first rather than attempting the comparatively meaningless but Herculean task of transforming a huge industry. ",2017-05-06T21:24:23+00:00
NeutralPolitics,comment,Single-payer system,dh7xwyf,SirJohnnyS,,"I don't believe it's as unrealistic as it may seem at the moment. In the political climate at the moment, no.

There's a few different ways to do healthcare. Canada is one but I'm not sure it's best to use in the US. This [article](http://decisiondata.org/news/how-much-single-payer-uhc-would-cost-usa/) examines what it would take to cover about 80% of the population because 100% coverage is rare. 

Going from the ACA to a system like Canada wouldn't be a huge reach. Providing federal funds to states to provide insurers the additional costs they face from covering people can't pay for the insurance costs without additional help. 

Allowing states to experiment different systems may need to be the way to find solutions. 

I think using a hybrid of Canada's/Netherlands/US Public utility model is something that should be considered. 

-Public utility companies are privately run and can efficiently adjust to their area. Less administrative hold ups.

-Netherland has a system similar to this, the companies cannot make a profit on basic coverage. Additional and Supplemental insurance is a market that can make profits and allow people to pay more for more/better coverage but everyone is covered. 

-Canada's federal government provides funds for healthcare to each province. If the provinces chooses to tax a higher rate to cover more, it may do so but again it most cover a minimum level of care. 

Doing that by state seems like a viable idea. It's impossible to say how taxing it would work. It could drive down costs on coverage. It's still a 2.3trillion sector of the economy. Obamacare raised inheritance tax by 3.5% and a handful of other areas and charged a penalty for not enrolling. 

The tax code is next on President Trump and congress' list of things to do... where you decide to tax people will really determine how much you'll have to pay. How much you want people to pay per visit can alter it. 

Healthcare coverage is so complicated in the US with a lot of groups pulling various directions. I wouldn't rule out anything within a decade though. ",2017-05-06T21:26:27+00:00

[At a recent town hall, California’s Sen. Dianne Feinstein was unfairly criticized for expressing concern about proposed state legislation to create a “single-payer” health care system for California. Her concerns are well founded. The practical reality is that setting up a single-payer system, especially for just one state, is unworkable. Under a single-payer system, health care would be financed through taxing people to support a government-run program rather than through having them or their employers pay for private health insurance coverage. Doing that would require a massive tax increase on California families along with huge pay cuts for nurses, doctors and other health care professionals. And, it would spell the end of the employer-sponsored insurance that half the state relies on and values.](http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/soapbox/article148488219.html#storylink=cpy)

NeutralPolitics,comment,Single-payer system,dhbigyc,None,,"It would be nearly impossible for a single State to adopt a healthcare model similar to Canada.  

**Wages would decrease for certain healthcare professionals**

In effect, private healthcare employees would become government workers, and would have to take a pay cut.  This may not seem terrible if a worker doesn't make much money currently, however to the doctor making $450,000 a year (while trying to pay off some ridiculously large student loans) they would be dis-incentivized to remain in the State.  What's stopping them from  working in a neighboring State to make more money?

**Special Interests**
In the United States, there exists an insane amount of interest groups that all have pull in many industries.  For the financial industry, the big six have dominated (and will continue to dominate) by lobbying the federal government for legislation that favors their industry directly or indirectly.  Healthcare, which is a trillion dollar industry, is no exception.  Nurses, Doctors and others have unions, which would put up an intense political fight against possible wage reductions.  If this didn't work, they'd refuse to fund any politician's campaigns that didn't agree with maintaining the status quo.  Big pharmaceutical corporations would also have something of a bone to pick with anybody who would see the status quo changed; Gilead Sciences, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Roche, Novartis, Amgen, Merck & Co., Sanofi, AbbVie, Actavis, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Lilly, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Novo Nordisk wouldn't desire to change the status quo unless they could keep their high profit margins.  

**Federal and State taxation issues**
California is a state with a high cost of living, and adding taxes onto that hurts the middle class.  It doesn't help that Californians pay an astronomically high state tax.  On top of this, one must take into account federal taxation -- which is already labyrinthine and bureaucratic.  It's structured so that taxes are too high for some groups, too low for others and non existent for America's privileged few.  In short, financial strain on the average Californian would increase, while benefits could decrease.  (I'll elaborate on the next point).  

**Shortage of healthcare providers**

Remember those wage reductions I mentioned earlier?  Well, if specialists, doctors and many others were to leave the State in search of larger net profit margins and/or lower regulatory barriers, Californians would experience all the negatives of a high demand and low supply.  Wait times would most likely increase due to a higher amount of doctors leaving the State, whilst healthcare quality levels would decrease for many Californians who currently benefit from the status quo.  

In order to properly reform the healthcare situation in this country, we need to follow these steps:

1)  **Simplify the tax structure and balance the federal budget/ reduce the national debt.**
Without this prerequisite, the federal government won't be able to help finance or develop any *long lasting* and meaningful progressive healthcare solution.  

2)  **Initiate and follow through on tort reform**
Many M.D's, especially surgeons and other specialists, must charge huge amounts of money for procedures or medications due to their liability insurance costs.  Malpractice insurance for specialists is usually higher because of how easy it is for a seemingly healthy patient to sue them based upon malpractice claims.  

3)  **Stressful working environments**
Without tort reform, many non - risk takers in the American healthcare industry will increasingly ""burn out"".  In an environment where stress and anxiety effect many workers, its no wonder that healthcare professionals have to be enticed with higher hourly or salaried payments or better benefits packages.  Each time this occurs, the average sick person must be charged more to finance pay increases.  Jobs in this industry are difficult to keep if your experienced, and without good pay or decent benefits, the incentive to remain in crucial administrative positions decreases.      

This post could go on, but the point is, reform won't happen unless everyone, including those fine with the status quo, is willing to push for systemic reform.  Healthcare, like many other aspects of the economy and public policy, is like a web.  If you flick one strand, the vibrations will be felt throughout.  

NOTE:  Mods, please take into account I have no sources to back this up currently.  Its late where I live, so I will come back to this post tomorrow and cite my sources.  If you must remove it soon, I'll save it, get many credible sources and then re-post it.

Military and law enforcement personnel would be exempt.

[Supporters argue](http://www.slate.com/blogs/breakingviews/2012/12/18/congress_should_push_for_mandatory_gun_insurance.html) that ""requiring liability coverage could be one way to keep the most dangerous weapons from unstable hands without infringing the law."" The law in question is the Second Amendment to the Constitution:

> ...the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

The NRA actually [endorses some personal liability insurance policies for firearms owners,](http://www.locktonaffinity.com/nrains/excess.htm) though they oppose mandating coverage. They, and other groups in opposition, also argue that this law doesn't address the real problem of *criminal* gun violence, because those who intend to commit criminal acts with firearms are unlikely to follow the legal requirement to carry insurance. [This article](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/insurance/gun-liability-insurance-mandatory.aspx) gives a pretty good overview of the various arguments for why an insurance mandate is unlikely to achieve its stated goals.

[Supporters counter](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwasik/2012/12/17/newtowns-new-reality-using-liability-insurance-to-reduce-gun-deaths/) that state mandates for car insurance have created ""market-based risk pricing,"" a concept which could be extended to gun ownership:

________________________________________________________

* Part One:  The actions of a few, reducing the freedom of the many


The [**CDC**](http://www.cdc.gov/features/alcohol-deaths/) estimates that each year, around 88 thousand people die as a result of alcohol overuse, to the point that ""1 in 10 deaths among working-age adults"" stems from alcohol abuse.

88 thousand deaths from over consumption, plus a little more than 10,000 yearly dying in DUI fatalities, [**CDC data for 2013**](http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/impaired-drv_factsheet.html), which also disproportionately kill the young.

Alcohol is also massively implicated in campus rape and sexual abuse, from [**Bureau of Justice Statistics**](http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5176), about half (47% in the study) of  sexual assaults reported (already a smaller number of likely assaults) involved alcohol - used to subdue a victim, or embolden an assailant.

[**Other studies cited by the National Institute of Justice**](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/225722.pdf) in this review finds a strong correlation between alcohol abuse and domestic violence.

From abuse mortality, to rapes, to domestic violence, alcohol consumption leads to nearly a hundred thousand deaths and rapes and beatings of innocent people year year in the United States, when we know that plenty of the non-fatal crimes and abuses perpetrated by alcohol abusers go unreported.

*So*

Should people who want to purchase alcohol for storage in their home, or at a bar/restaurant not just have to show an ID, but proof of insurance?

After all - - - anyone who drives a car (and we know how [lethal those are - **NHTSA**](http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx); 30 thousand fatal crashes killing 33 thousand people in 2012 alone) on public motorways *has* to carry insurance, and not even on the basis of criminal liability like this law.


On top of IDs, maybe, background checks at bars and restaurants (we could even get the same BATFE involved), liability insurance mandatory to renew, etc. Simply add on 15-30 dollars each time you want to go out for each drink you want to buy. After all; it's for the greater good and your safety, just in case you're a rapist or a drunk driver.
_________________________

Obviously, no, no we shouldn't, because the overwhelmingly majority of the dozens of millions, potentially hundreds of millions of Americans who responsibly consume alcohol each year, (often each week), aren't rapists, aren't domestic abusers and aren't drunk drivers.

A mandatory insurance scheme of liability coverage for the actions of committing those kinds of crimes isn't necessary because the vast, vast majority *simply do not ever commit those crimes at all*.

I would imagine most people reading this drink alcohol, and have most members of their family/friends as people who drink alcohol. 

I would further imagine almost all of you here (and your friends and family), aren't rapists. Aren't domestic abusers. Aren't drunk drivers.

And I would be very sorry if part of your existence and freedom under the law were to be lumped in with that sort of crowd, instead of being respected for the responsible people you are.

* Part Two: ""Hey, those guys say something like this is a good thing!""

The NRA's advocacy that its members take financial and legal steps to protect themselves (often from liabilities that may arise as a result of laws the NRA itself lobbies to have overturned, in favor of people whom they believe are otherwise acting in lawful self defense) cannot be taken to be an indication that government mandate of universal insurance purchase for firearms owners fits with responsible firearms ownership, anymore than conservative lawmakers or financially right wing individuals purchasing health insurance for themselves means they accept the notion in the PPACA/Obamacare that the government ought mandate everyone to purchase private health insurance under a set of insurance norms written down in law.

Put another way; the entire distinction of public and private, mandatory and voluntary, barrier to a right and enhancement of a right, however you'd like to frame it, actually does matter to firearms owners, many of whom do simply own guns as a practical home defense and recreational matter, but also take very seriously the notion that ultimately, the second amendment exists to prevent any practical government monopoly on the use of force as pushed for by the anti-Federalists during the writing of the Constitution - - [The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people...**SCOTUS**  *Heller*](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf)

A national, Federal mandated system of names, ownership, addresses, all under the record and database management of private firms required to cooperate with Federal and State lawenforcement is registration by another name - - - and functionally forbidden by [**FOPA 1986**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm_Owners_Protection_Act)  (a Federal law, not just a Court interpretation of law). Given the Federal government's numerous missteps and outright obfuscation of its activity in monitoring Americans via the NSA, 'wittingly' or not, I don't think you'll find much practical support among firearms owners at this point to just take the word of Congressmembers whose voting history is on the side of reducing firearms rights that no registry will happen (especially not since such registries, as yet unchallenged, but also unlawful under 1986 FOPA, exist in several States, including the one the Congresswoman hails from)

* Part Three: John and James both wear shoes, ergo both are runners.

Firearms crime is obviously a thing that happens in the United States; [**CDC** has it around 11 to 12 thousand each year](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm), as does the [**FBI**'s Uniform Crime Reports](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_8_murder_victims_by_weapon_2008-2012.xls)

But to note about the data:

Most firearms homicides are committed with handguns.

Not rifles, or shotguns or any other type of longguns (not even statutorily State defined ""assault weapons"") - - - those constitute, even in a rough year like 2008, about 3% of all firearms homicides.

I don't imagine Carolyn Maloney would want rifle owners to have vastly reduced liability insurance, especially not those outside her State, who can own all sorts of 'assault weapons' her own State's Governor has strictly forbidden for new ownership and required registered.

But that brings us to the issue of underwriting standards, and a few pertinent questions:

1) Will black people have to pay more money if they want to exercise their second amendment rights? 

2) Will Latinos have to pay more money if they want to exercise their second amendment rights? 

3) Will people who graduated from college, and have W2 employment be able to pay less? 

4) Will people who live in high crime neighborhoods have to pay more? 

ETC.
Furthermore, the parade of bete noirs that liability insurance is supposed to either dissuade, or make financially less awful when they occur is *what* exactly?

Firearms crime?
Forgive me if I am suspicious of the idea of gang members, and impulse/mass shooters with criminal motives or mental health problems being particularly dutiful about letting the government know they're violating weapons laws in order to not violate weapons laws.

Firearms being stolen? 

Does car insurance do much to prevent vehicle theft? And cars are way, way bigger/conspicuously colored to boot.

Does car insurance do much to promote *safer* driving?

On this count; perhaps if a private firm offers rewards for people who meet markers of responsibility (a high GPA and an indication you're a married family man can actually get you lower rates, as well as proof that you don't drive that much) - - - - but what would liability insurance do for firearms owners?


And the incidence of these accidents?

From the University of Utah School of Medicinem [citing **CDC**](http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/GUNS/GUNSTAT.html), there were about 600 accidental gun deaths in 2010.

The national count of accidental deaths is actually increasing, but the all time high [set in 1969, **NBC News**](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19080118/ns/health-health_care/t/accidental-death-rate-creeping-higher-us/) is about 116 thousand (2013 data from CDC says about 100k for that year).

Let's say 2016 has wild high of 1000 accidental gun deaths and 5000 accidental firearms injuries, and a stunning low of 90,000 accidental deaths.

We'd still have just one percent of accidental deaths coming from firearms, in a nation of 100 million gun owners and some 300+ million guns.

The numbers, even when you exaggerate them to provide ""worse case"" scenarios, really don't seem that convincing to me. Simply: **the majority of firearms owners never commit firearms crime or have firearms accidents**

NeutralPolitics,comment,Insurance,crv4qvc,None,,"The most obvious problem regarding liability insurance for gun ownership is that it creates a de-facto gun registry.

I can see an argument for concealed carry individuals being compelled to have insurance (since their ownership of a firearm is already on record) as a way of avoiding the first problem, but I think it would be an undue burden on those who carry - they're already taking on a massive responsibility and duty for their community, and the requirements for CCW already establish that they are competent and law abiding people in the first place.

Legal CCW gun owners are rarely involved in criminal acts - even less so than the average citizen. I can cite that if anyone wants but I'm tired, it's late so do your own googling maybe?

Lastly, there are already civil penalties levied against those who use firearms in a negligent fashion. The real criminals aren't going to purchase insurance because of the first problem, so the financial burden will be solely on those who aren't shooting other people.",2015-06-04T08:48:05+00:00

What if this 20-year-old is an upstanding citizen who was unlucky enough to end up in an area with a high violent crime rate? Making it prohibitively expensive for him to acquire the means with which to defend himself isn't helping him at all.

>Supporters argue that ""requiring liability coverage could be one way to keep the most dangerous weapons from unstable hands without infringing the law.""

Such a law isn't targeting unstable hands, it's targeting the poor. Not everyone who's poor is a gang banger. Most just want to be able to defend themselves and their families from the aforementioned gang bangers who would seek to do them harm. Such a law will only discourage firearm ownership by all but the wealthy, by making it prohibitively expensive for those who are already in tight situations financially.

Criminals don't care much about the law, and probably won't care about this one either. According to the [NIJ](http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/gun-violence/pages/aquired.aspx), most criminals acquire their firearms illegally already.

> Surveys of offenders have found that they prefer newer, high-quality guns and may steal or borrow them; most, however, acquire guns “off the street” through the illicit gun market.

Despite what some may have you believe, violent crime [has been in decline for at least the past 20 years](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/1tabledatadecoverviewpdf/table_1_crime_in_the_united_states_by_volume_and_rate_per_100000_inhabitants_1994-2013.xls). There are many factors which affect violent crime rates. Firearm ownership per capita isn't a very big one. I've generally heard it argued that better education and low poverty rates are the biggest factors that effect crime.

If you have assets these could be at risk of execution to satisfy a judgement. You could lose everything.

NeutralPolitics,comment,Insurance,crwk69y,noadvanced_stats,,"> The CDC estimates that each year, around 88 thousand people die as a result of alcohol overuse, to the point that ""1 in 10 deaths among working-age adults"" stems from alcohol abuse.

The difficulty with alcohol insurance would be the extreme difficulty determining the proximate cause of whatever damage the alcohol instigated.  If the damage is due to chronic alcohol use, who is going to be liable?  Even if it is due to a DUI or sexual assault and all the alcohol is consumed in one evening, usually more than one source provides the alcohol.  Should the guy who gives you the first drink be liable because after 10 something bad happened?

Misuse or over serving of alcohol by a single bar or establishment can lead to a tort claim against a general liability policy.  One of the problems this is seeking to address is that all too often there is no claim against someone for negligently using a gun or not securing a gun.  Simply having insurance would lead to an industry of people interested in pursuing claims against negligent gun owners for injury.",2015-06-05T16:03:27+00:00

Guns are designed to kill and injure people. Gun violence is an unfortunate side effect that results from the choices that people make. Alcohol is a chemical substance, not a deadly weapon.

Some record-breaking?,"I was reading this article and it talks about how much insurance companies are making. What are the reasons for premiums going up if they are already profitable?

http://www.salon.com/2016/10/28/making-a-killing-under-obamacare-the-aca-gets-the-blame-for-rising-premiums-while-insurance-companies-are-reaping-massive-profits/",2017-06-24T09:06:48+00:00
NeutralPolitics,comment,Premiums,djf0ihq,Excelius,,"One of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act was the [80/20 Rule](https://www.healthcare.gov/health-care-law-protections/rate-review/).  This required health insurers to spend at least 80% of premiums on health care reimbursements, leaving 20% for administrative overhead and profit and so forth. The law actually required insurance companies to send consumers rebate checks, if they charged too much in premiums.

The intent here was of course to limit the proportion of premiums that would go towards insurance company overhead as opposed to paying for care.  

Unfortunately this creates a pretty perverse incentive, where insurance companies no longer have any real incentive to control healthcare costs.  Whatever they pay out just gets passed back to consumers in the form of higher premiums, but the more they pay out in claims the more they're allowed to take in overhead.  

Paying for a $100 medication for a customer means they can take $20, but paying for a $1000 medication means they can take $200 in overhead.  Which one do you think results in an insurance executive getting the fattest bonus?

NeutralPolitics,comment,Premiums,dje8v0i,NosuchRedditor,,"The piece you link speaks of profits, but the entire piece is focused on stock prices and dividends.  Nowhere in the piece do I see any numbers on how much profit they are making by percentage, which is how profits are typically measured.

Some of the reasons for the rising stock price can be explained by forcing people to buy a product.  Kind of a no brainer to invest in the stock of a company that sells a mandatory product, and so many investors large and small invested driving up the stock price.  But stock price is not a measure of profitability, it's an assessment of the value of the underlying company, and again the value of a company selling a product you are mandated to buy is going to be valued highly by the market.

For an example of how stock price does not equate to profits look at Tesla.  Tesla's stock now trades just shy of $400 a share, while profitable car manufacturers like Ford and GM trade around $50, and they make thousands more cars than Tesla, who does not profit at all on the cars it sells, they lose money.  But the promise of revolutionizing the car market has driven the stock to incredible highs in complete absence of any profit, nor is the company expected to turn a profit for several more years.  This kind of speculation on profit is what drove up the prices of health insurers once it became mandatory to carry insurance.

For a more informational piece that actually discusses profits of healthcare companies try this one from Forbes:
>Some will take this as a sure sign that President Obama's ""sellout"" to big insurance companies has worked exactly as intended: ""to multiply the profits of five giant insurance companies."" Of course, the sometimes acid rhetoric of President Obama, Kathleen Sebelius, Nancy Pelosi and progessive bloggers notwithstanding, **insurance company profits were never very large in the first place. As my chart shows, even at their ""peak"" in 2005, profits as a percentage of revenues (read: premiums) were only slightly more than 7%--a respectable number to be sure, but one that was beaten by 21 other industries (of the 50 or so total industries represented on the Fortune 500). So it was always a bit bizarre to have Kathleen Sebelius denouncing health insurer profits as ""immoral"" (in February 2010) when 2009 profit levels barely exceeded 3%.**

Aside from the fact that your linked piece is intentionally misleading by attempting to link speculative stock prices with profit, One of the key tenets of Obama care is that 'excess profits' would have to be returned to the Government.

>One factor that will affect health insurer profitability will be the so-called ""bailout"" funds for health insurers. Those who have paid attention to this issue know that the ""risk corridors"" were originally supposed to be budget neutral **(""excess profits"" by some insurers would be clawed back to pay to insurers who experienced losses on the Exchanges).  But now it has been estimated that the risk corridors will cost taxpayers about $900 million in 2014.**  https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/06/27/profits-in-health-insurance-under-obamacare/#5bdf57bd3c3a

The Salon piece doesn't mention the fact that taxpayers had to hand over 900 million dollars to insurance companies because Obamacare requires it, it's the law.

Those of us trying to be well informed knew that most health insurance providers had profits in the 2~3% range prior to Obamacare, which is a far smaller profit than most industries command.  The Salon piece covers none of this.

So in short, the reason premiums keep going up has much more to do with the massive bureaucracy created by Obamacare, and the $900 million required to be paid by tax payers in one year due to losses in the 'risk corridor' which is actuarial speak for covering pre existing conditions and community rating.  It has nothing to do with 'record profits' at health insurance companies.",2017-06-25T23:07:49+00:00

NeutralPolitics,comment,Premiums,djeq0h6,CQME,,">What are the reasons for premiums going up if they are already profitable?

One thing you want to keep in mind when it comes to corporate America is that if more profit can be made, a company would be stupid not to make it.  [The name of the game is profit maximization](http://economics.illinoisstate.edu/ntskaggs/readings/maximization.shtml), and all other considerations for the corporation are secondary to this singular goal.  For a corporation, customer satisfaction, product innovation, etc, all of these societal goods are secondary to profit maximization, and if customer satisfaction for example leads to lower profits, then a corporation will sacrifice customer satisfaction for profit.  If a corporation doesn't seek to maximize profit, they will cede market share to those that do, and eventually they'll be run out of business.

So, when it comes to ""reasons for premiums going up if they are already profitable"", one answer is that it's not about simple profit, but rather profit maximization.  The end of your Salon article cites one attempt at potentially raising premiums and thereby profits, i.e. attempts by the industry to consolidate into either an oligopoly or a monopoly, which would lead to[ even higher profits for the surviving firms.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_profit)",2017-06-26T07:10:09+00:00

It's there, actually:

> ""On Thursday, Aetna reported $734 million in profit on $15.8 billion in revenue for the three months that ended Sept. 30. The nation’s third-largest health insurer by revenue handily beat Wall Street estimates for the quarter. Chief Financial Officer Shawn M. Guertin cited “solid performance” in the company’s core health insurance business that offset “pressure” from its business under the Affordable Care Act.

> ""“Pressure” here refers to the fact that, while Aetna has reaped an ACA windfall, it can’t make money insuring the sicker and costlier undesirables who are desperately trying to access affordable care by seeking coverage on the ACA exchanges.

> ***""Aetna’s earnings report came a week after UnitedHealth reported a 12 percent jump in revenue to $46.3 billion for the three months that ended Sept. 30 compared with the same period the previous year.*** The company collected $36.1 billion in insurance premiums, a sum 11 percent higher than for the year-ago quarter, while ***profits increased 29 percent to $1.98 billion as the company signed up 955,000 more health insurance customers through its employer and individual plans.*** (Anthem, Cigna and Humana will report their latest quarterly earnings next week.)""

Obviously this isn't going to be nearly as comprehensive or authoritative as a 10k, but clearly UnitedHealth experienced a much higher increase in profit compared to their increase in revenue, which would support the claim that they've become far more profitable over the past year.  That's not to say that they have, because that jump in profit could be for myriad number of reasons, for example they could have made massive write-offs the year prior that they didn't have to make this year.

2. The premium the insurance company is charging might not actually be increasing by 17%, but the company is paying less of the total premium which is leveraging their increase.

NeutralPolitics,post,Deductibles,7kz5i2,AFlaccoSeagulls,Does the GOP Tax Plan cut deductions for personal expenses such as a home office?,"To preface, my dad just sent me a picture out of [this](http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/dec/18/the-final-federal-tax-bill-an-explainer/) article, stating:

> Business employees can no longer claim a number of miscellaneous deductions for unreimbursed expenses, including a home office, union dues, licensing fees, professional organization memberships and work-related education.

I have searched a few websites trying to use the keyword 'home office' and have found nothing being reported on this front.

This issue is important to me, because my girlfriend works from home full-time with her job and I work from home occasionally as well, so deducting the space dedicated to our office is rather important to us, and losing that is huge.

So I just want to know, how accurate is this claim? If it's true, is it being offset somehow, or just completely gone?",2017-12-20T04:54:37+00:00
NeutralPolitics,comment,Deductibles,drjjjtk,BCSWowbagger2,,"Disclaimer: IANAL, and certainly not a tax lawyer, the most boring part of law. I am not certain my answer is correct. However, it is an answer, and you haven't received any yet.

This answer covers *only* the question about the home office deduction, which seems to be the important part for you.

Using IRS [Publication 587](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p587.pdf) as a jumping-off point, I found what I *believe* is the controlling statute, [26 USC §280A](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/280A). This law generally defines how to deduct expenses relating to a home office (or home daycare facility) from your adjusted gross income. It is written in thick legalese, of course.

But I don't need to understand §280A. I just need to know if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has *changed* §280A.

Unfortunately, Congress.gov does not yet have the full, completed, enacted text of the bill yet, because it hasn't been enacted yet!  The most recent version is the [Senate amendment of the conference committee report](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1/BILLS-115hr1eas2.pdf), which I believe is the final text of the bill -- but not until President Trump signs it. Then I simply did Ctrl-F and found all references in the bill to ""280"". After all, Congress can't amend a section of existing law without identifying it!  Well, hopefully not, anyway.

There are a number of items in §280 that are amended by the tax bill, including an incredibly suspicious-looking bit about luxury car allowances that I didn't dig into. However, there are no changes to §280A. Thus, as far as I can tell, no change to the home office deduction.

Second, I looked up the [bill that originally passed the House](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1/BILLS-115hr1eh.pdf), just to cover my bases. The same search *did* turn up a change to §280A this time!  But it was nothing important: they literally just changed a headline, no actual law. (They deleted the words ""casualty losses"" from the label of §280A(b).)

This, combined with the fact that I have seen nothing about the home office deduction in any other news outlet or publication, leads me to believe that *The Spokesman-Review* erred in its characterization of the final bill. I do not believe there are any changes to the home office deduction in this bill.

However, you may find that, given the expansion of the standard deduction, it would be more lucrative to take the standard deduction anyway.

Do confirm this -- both parts -- with your accountant.

UPDATE: Just an update to say that I will update this comment if I learn I am wrong.  Which, once again, I could very well be.

**UPDATE2: I was wrong.** AGH! They dicked me!  They dicked me with a inclusion-by-reference clause!  I hate it when they do that! Thank you to [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/tax-bill-small-business-deductions/) for straightening me out.

The final Senate bill modifies [26 USC §67](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/67). This section states that (except for certain ""special"" deductions like charitable gift and medical expense deductions, listed in §67(b)), your total itemized deductions cannot be higher than 2% of your adjusted gross income. So, if you make $80,000/year after all adjustments, your maximum deduction is $1600. This 2% total cap includes the home office deduction. Section 280A is included by the generic reference to all itemized deductions in section §67(a), and it isn't specifically excluded by §67(b), so it counts. (This is why I say it is ""included by reference,"" rather than by specific section number. It makes me so mad when the U.S. Code does this, because it is a sign of lazy, rushed draftsmanship by Congressmen who don't give a damn whether their constitutuents are capable of reading or understanding the massive omnibus bills they pass into law. Hate hate hate hate this.) In case there's any remaining doubt, [IRS Publication 529](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p529#en_US_2016_publink100026933) states clearly that the 2% cap limit includes the home office deduction. 

But that's current law. The new law inserts an even-more-sloppy clause into §67:

>Notwithstanding subsection (a), no miscellaneous itemized deduction shall be allowed for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026.

So, what this means is, all itemized deductions not specifically named in subsection (b) as being one of the ""special"" deduction are suspended for the next ten years. The home office deduction is not a ""special"" deduction. That means it is suspended. So are all other deductions listed in Publication 529 (linked above).

Why just ten years? Because Congress doesn't care very much about the long-term economic impacts of their bills; they just need accounting gimmicks so that the bill technically passes muster with the Congressional Budget Office (which only projects out ten years into the future... hence so many things expiring after ten years).

On a side note, /u/uselessjd is correct that it is not easy to correctly deduct a home office, and you may already have been doing it wrong. You mention that you occasionally work from home and use the deduction, but this is incorrect; since the home office is not your ""principal place of business,"" but merely an occasional business site used ""for convenience,"" you are completely excluded from the deduction. Only your gf can potentially claim it. It's also not clear to me that this could have a huge impact on your (or her) final tax bill. Since the deduction was already limited to 2% of your adjusted gross income, and deductions are much less valuable than credits, you'd have to be making quite a lot of money before this could have an impact on you of more than a couple hundred dollars -- and, hopefully, the expansion of the standard deduction will offset that substantially.

But still: this deduction is going away for ten years, and I'm sorry I got that wrong initially.",2017-12-20T22:27:46+00:00

The truth is that insurance is an inefficient way of paying for healthcare. Insurance works for risk management, not for cost smoothing. There's a reason nobody uses their auto insurance to pay for a new tire or an oil change and nobody use home insurance to pay for the repair of a window.

Insurance is a bad way of covering common, predictable, and expected costs. The health-care market needs to move more into 2 party transactions and out of 3 party ones - actually 4 if one includes the employers; or 5, if one includes the government. People need to start paying health care like they pay for their white goods - out of pocket, by saving or borrowing.

NeutralPolitics,comment,Medicaid,ca5bezi,altrocks,,"I see lots of misinformation here. Let me clarify  one thing: SS, Medicare and Medicaid are not investment funds that we pay into and collect on later. From the beginning it has been a social safety net where the young, healthy and employed members of society give up some of their income to keep the elderly and disabled (or people otherwise incapable of providing for themselves anymore) from becoming homeless, starving and dead, which is what often happened once a person was too old to work.

And many people made it past retirement age when SS started. Infant mortality and fatal childhood diseases along with lots of industrial age dangers brought the average lifespan down significantly. With vaccines and better medical technology, as well as shifting to a less industrial economy, our life span averages are now longer. The reason we have so many people hitting retirement age is because there are a lot of Baby Boomers, and they're all hitting retirement age now. It's one very large cohort straining the system currently. It happens.

As for what can be done, there are some good suggestions in the thread already. Don't borrow against the SS/Medicare fund. Increase retirement age a little. Add means testing to the system. All of those would help, but they won't fix any deficit problems we have. Our deficit problems are much larger than one set of programs. Our military spending, corporate welfare subsidies, and tax loopholes/tax dodgers are killing us. We need to address all aspects together if we want to solve that problem.",2013-05-24T19:22:12+00:00
NeutralPolitics,comment,Medicaid,ca56eg9,None,,"So I guess the first question is ""why do you think it's now time?""  What is the catalyst?  is it because of the high debt/deficit?  

Yes, that's true, and yes, entitlements make up a big piece and will be an even increasingly larger piece in the future.

But the reason the deficit went from a surplus when Clinton left to a trillion+ when Obama began his term is largely because of military spending and bank/auto bailouts.  

That said, there is urgency around entitlements, I agree completely.

A quick fix would be to means test social security, but then you are completely fucking over the people who paid into it their entire life and get nothing back - it also makes it not an ""entitlement"" anymore, if you aren't giving it to people.

The age should be pushed back a ton.  People get pissy about it, but Social Security was never meant to be your retirement fund.  When it started, the age was 65, which was longer than the average lifespan of an American.  Now the average lifespan is well into the 80s, and people are still collecting in their 60s.  The age should be pushed back to 75.  

A tangentially related fix for me would be end the income tax and move to a consumption-based sales tax.  You could still make it very progressive by exempting staple goods like groceries, clothing under a certain amount, vehicles under a certain amount.  This would ensure that a) poor people get to keep more of their money in their pocket, and b) that their money would go a longer way because much of what they NEED to spend money on (e.g., not Ipads, expensive sneakers and flatscreen TVs) wouldn't be subject to tax.",2013-05-24T15:43:32+00:00

Since someone is going to be harmed when a Ponzi scheme collapses we are going to let all of that harm fall to government. Spending must be decreased to an amount less than ""revenue"" to start. ""Revenue"" has averaged 19% of GDP since WWII. We need to pass an amendment to the constitution that spending may not rise above 15% of the previous 7 years average of the GDP. That makes some room to pay our debts. The reason that this is the first step is because when we harm the government to fix the Ponzi scheme we do not want our creditors to panic or the value of the dollar to crash.

Give up on SS entirely. Convert to mandatory contribution private retirement accounts instead with a small means tested income security program. Based on current retirement income numbers the income security program would cost less then $50b even if we raised the benefits it offered to the point of eliminating retiree poverty entirely, this number would also be reduced over time as people make use of their retirement funds.

A mandatory savings rate of 10% on incomes over $10k would mean someone at the median income would have retirement savings of ~5x what SS currently offers (~$1.5m vs $330k). The income security program would require an income tax of 0.4% on incomes over $15k to fund.",2013-05-24T17:51:09+00:00

HTTP://www.ssa.gov/history/lifeexpect.html

From 1940 to 1990, there was about a 35% increase in the number of men surviving until age 65 if they made it to age 21 (38% for women). However, over that same 50 years, the average life expectancy *after* age 65 increased only about 3.6 years (for men; 4.9 for women). So it's not really that people are living significantly longer lives. It's that more of them are making it to old age.

That's not to say that there isn't a cost associated with that. Just keep in mind that all those extra surviving babies are paying into Social Security during their working lives, and there are far more of them than there are of people who are living significantly longer than in years past.

From his website,

>The Medicare for All Who Want It public alternative will help America reach universal coverage by providing an affordable insurance option to the currently uninsured. The public alternative will provide the same essential health benefits as those currently available on the marketplaces and ensure that everyone has access to high-quality, comprehensive coverage.  
>  
>The plan will automatically enroll individuals in affordable coverage if they are eligible for it, while those eligible for subsidized coverage will have a simple enrollment option. A backstop fund will reimburse health care providers for unpaid care to patients who are uninsured. Individuals who fall through the cracks will be retroactively enrolled in the public option.

Proponents of the plan argue that it provides all Americans with affordable healthcare coverage without the expense that comes with replacing private healthcare, and would incentivize private healthcare to keep their prices low. Opponents ([New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/opinion/medicare-for-all.html) incoming) argue that: ""the price of health care services — not insurance or pharmaceutical profits — is the primary driver of America’s ballooning health care spending.

[Conservative critics](https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/29/why-pete-buttigiegs-medicare-for-all-who-want-it-is-a-sham/) of the plan seem to fear that it will eventually lead to the elimination of private insurance altogether.

What are the benefits and drawbacks of this type of plan (particularly compared to the Medicare for All and/or our current system)? How feasible is this?

NeutralPolitics,comment,Medicare,filli73,starsinblack,,"Logically, this would encourage cream skimming for insurance companies. 

Here's the thing - the people that would enrol into the public option for ""Medicare for all who want it"" are generally going to be the people who require care and cannot access it otherwise (can't afford regular private insurance.) This is an assumption, because we don't 100% know how it's going to play out, but the likely scenario is that private insurance will still have the rich and the young - the rich because they can afford it, and the healthy young because they'll probably get a better private rate since they require relatively little care. 

You'll have a public system that is bought into by the poor and those who need care for chronic conditions, and they will require more from the system than what they pay into it. You need the rich/healthy/young to buy into it because that's what offsets the costs of those who require a lot of care. With this, private insurance will make a killing with the rich who pay a lot of insurance and will maybe require a lot of care (but also maybe they don't) and the young who will pay into it and probably won't need a ton of care. 

There are some academic articles on cream skimming in other insurance fields, but not a lot on healthcare. Every insurance field cream skims, and there's some evidence that hospitals do too. You can even see it in doctor's choices in accepting rostered family care patients - they are much more likely to accept those without chronic conditions because it's much more work for same pay for chronic patients.

The downsides are that a public option would not reduce costs enough since private insurance would continue to keep administrative costs up. Private insurance companies would also be able to overburden the public option with sick people while taking all the healthy ones, maximizing their own profits.

NeutralPolitics,comment,Medicare,fimbbz6,sop27,,"**Pros:** The up-side to MFA who want it is that this plan won't alienate the huge voting block this is people who receive and are happy with the healthcare they receive through their jobs. Powerful Unions which are essential to the Democratic vote are especially interested in this subject.

Another consideration is that this will not immediately throw the private insurance industry into a tailspin. If MFA were passed, there would be millions of displaced workers throughout all sectors of our economy, especially the healthcare and insurance industries.

Also, MFA who want it will be much easier to pass into law than MFA. Even if the Democrats controlled both houses of congress and the Presidency, [MFA will never pass](https://slate.com/business/2019/11/medicare-for-all-warren-bernie-democrats.html) with the needed majority at this time.

**Cons:** The problem with MFA who want it is that it does nothing to tackle some of the key issues that drive up the cost of healthcare in America. Yes, the price of healthcare services in America is a giant problem. So are the [price of lifesaving drugs](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/no-end-sight-rising-drug-prices-study-finds-n1012181), [cost of new curative treatments](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/03/drug-prices-high-cost-research-and-development/585253/), [PBMs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/physiciansfoundation/2019/08/22/pbms-driving-up-costs-and-lowering-quality-care-in-america/), [cost of hospital care](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/reports/2019/06/26/471464/high-price-hospital-care/), [salaries of doctors](https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/10/25/doctors-salaries-pay-disparities-000557), etc, etc.

Also, this is a relatively status-quo plan and, since it starts rather conservatively, we can expect that key parts of the bill will be eroded in the legislative process. So, by the time it reaches the President's desk, it may look very similar to what we already have.

Edit: Another pro to MFA who want it is that a MFA plan could actually alienate the poor (including the very poor, some working poor, and college students) if it was ever passed.

NeutralPolitics,comment,Medicare,filjl5z,meowgrrr,,"I don't feel I'm particularly knowledgable enough to answer your question, but I think a really great resource if you would like more information on the topic is the book ""The Healing of America: A Global Quest for Better, Cheaper, and Fairer Health Care"" by T.R. Reid. The book compares and contrasts the healthcare systems in a number of different countries, including the US, with the backdrop of T.R. Reid exploring treatment options for a bad shoulder in each of the countries. He does a really great job detailing the pros and cons, similarities and differences, of the different healthcare systems. ([Edit: Here is a link to a PBS frontline episode about the book with lots of info if you don't have the time to read the book](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/sickaroundtheworld/))

I think a really important take away for me with the book is that many of the countries frequently cited as having universal healthcare do not have medicare-for-all or single payer systems (for example, germany, france, switzerland, and others have multi-payer but universal healthcare systems). It's something I wish was discussed more.

Right now, I think both democrats and republicans have painted a wrong picture that universal healthcare = single-payer = socialized medicine...but the reality is you can have multi-payer universal healthcare, and single payer doesn't always mean socialized medicine either (Canada has single-payer healthcare but is not socialized medicine, the government is the payer but doctors are not necessarily government employees and hospitals may or may not be government run). Even if you are socialist or other similar political ideologies, I think we can all agree that misinformation doesn't help anyone and many people are unfortunately totally turned off by the idea of universal healthcare because of a misattribution to socialism.

I would love if this conversation (in this thread but most importantly in general) could be expanded to discuss the universal healthcare systems in other countries, particularly the multi-payer models because I think both democrats and republicans would be receptive of them. And I think we will get a better healthcare system in the US if we consider ALL of the options.",2020-02-24T00:11:24+00:00

Private insurance companies will still be massively profitable as they find ways to continue skimming the most profitable individuals, and pushing those in most need onto the public option (currently, they are pushed to the fake ""high deductible"" plans). 

Obviously it will be better, at least in the short term, to have more people covered by real insurance plans rather than the scam ""high deductible"" plans. Because the ""public option"" is designed to maintain private profit-taking from healthcare, it's almost certain to be massively more expensive to the public purse than a system not designed to maximize private profit-taking.

NeutralPolitics,post,Public option,47d400,olily,The Public Option vs. Medicare for All,"Hillary has recently [reaffirmed her support](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/hillary-clinton-health-care-bernie-sanders-219643) for the ""[public option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health_insurance_option)."" 


From [her website](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/):

>Continue to support a “public option”—and work to build on the Affordable Care Act to make it possible. As she did in her 2008 campaign health plan, and consistently since then, Hillary supports a “public option” to reduce costs and broaden the choices of insurance coverage for every American. To make immediate progress toward that goal, Hillary will work with interested governors, using current flexibility under the Affordable Care Act, to empower states to establish a public option choice.

Bernie prefers “Medicare for All.” From [his website](https://berniesanders.com/issues/medicare-for-all/):

>Bernie’s plan would create a federally administered single-payer health care program. Universal single-payer health care means comprehensive coverage for all Americans. Bernie’s plan will cover the entire continuum of health care, from inpatient to outpatient care; preventive to emergency care; primary care to specialty care, including long-term and palliative care; vision, hearing and oral health care; mental health and substance abuse services; as well as prescription medications, medical equipment, supplies, diagnostics and treatments. Patients will be able to choose a health care provider without worrying about whether that provider is in-network and will be able to get the care they need without having to read any fine print or trying to figure out how they can afford the out-of-pocket costs.

Let’s compare the two visions of the future of health care, public option vs. Medicare for all:

In what ways are the plans similar? In what ways are they different?

Which plan would have greater benefits? Which would have greater disadvantages?

Which plan would cost more? Which would save more money?

Which (if either) would be more likely to be implemented?

Any other comparison you might wish to make are welcome.

NeutralPolitics,comment,Public option,d0ce6fp,teknobo,,"> In what ways are the plans similar? In what ways are they different?

The biggest similarity between the plans is that both feature *a* government operating a health insurer that anyone can sign up for. That's about where the similarities end though.

Bernie's is about making Medicare, a federal program, the sole provider of health payments in the US. A great misconception about universal healthcare in the US is that all other countries operate the healthcare systems with this structure, which is flatly untrue. Off the top of my head, only Australia has one, federal single payer.

Hillary is suggesting using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to encourage state governments to set up an health insurance plan. Section 1332 lets states apply for ""innovation waivers"" to waive some ACA requirements and do their own thing with their healthcare systems as long as they still achieve mostly the same goals. So Hillary's saying she'd work with states to make sure those innovations are public healthcare options. Signing up for such insurance plans would of course be optional, not mandatory. So already we've got major structural differences in the scope, operation, and bargaining power of these plans.

> Which plan would have greater benefits? Which would have greater disadvantages?

This is a value judgement that I won't get into, but I can outline some differences.

Medicare for All would by definition cover all ~320 million Americans. Aside from obviously insuring everyone, this also gives it a massive amount of bargaining power in the healthcare market, allowing it to effectively set prices at will, forcing down prices and possibly encouraging some much needed efficiency improvements to the American healthcare system. The flip side though is that Medicare isn't free so taxes would go up enormously. Especially when you don't put in any of the common cost control measures used by health insurers worldwide like co-pays and deductibles. Arguably, if your taxes cost less than your current health insurance then you still come out ahead, but there's a chance that calculation won't work out for you. You also end up with Congress making judgements about what will and will not be covered, which is bad if someone needs that treatment. ""Death panels"" is a dumb talking point, but there's a *strong* chance that Congress would force Medicare-for-All to not cover something politically contentious, like abortions (i.e. the Hyde Amendment). There are ways to relieve some of these tensions with supplemental insurance plans, but I haven't seen those mentioned much by Sanders.

Hillary's state-based public option wouldn't have the relative rigidity of Medicare for All. Not that an public insurer in Arkansas would allow abortions, but by the very nature of it being an option, there will almost certainly be private insurers that cover abortions. But since a public option insurer would cover fewer people, it'd have less bargaining power, making it harder to lower prices. Also, state governments are notoriously garbage at things like corruption, civil rights, and social insurance programs in general. So it'd be reasonable to expect all kinds of shenanigans about coverage and payments.

> Which plan would cost more? Which would save more money?

This is hard to say. Kenneth Thorpe estimated that Bernie's current Medicare-for-All plan is [twice as expensive as he says](http://www.vox.com/2016/1/28/10858644/bernie-sanders-kenneth-thorpe-single-payer). But Clinton's plan, being more a pretty quiet addition to her website than the consistent stumping that Sanders has done, is pretty hard to score. Pretty sure Section 1332 doesn't allocate massive new funds for state waivers though, so as far as the federal budget is concerned, there probably wouldn't be any big changes. But as Vermont learned when it tried to implement its own single payer plans, healthcare is damn expensive, so taxes within states with a public option would likely go up by some amount.

> Which (if either) would be more likely to be implemented?

This one is easy, even staying neutral. Sanders is proposing a major expansion of Medicare that would have to go through a likely-Republican Congress that's not keen to approve anything even close to that kind of major entitlement expansion. That's all just a roundabout way of saying that Sanders' healthcare plan has a snowball's chance in hell of passing Congress. Hillary is basically proposing an executive twist on the Affordable Care Act, which conveniently for her has already passed Congress. So she wouldn't have any problems there. The trick here though is that her plan relies on state governments presenting detailed plans to get Section 1332 waivers. As in, she's relying on state governments, which all follow their own bizarre political calculus and are all at least as likely as Congress to do nothing at all. And even if say, Minnesota, comes up with public option, that wouldn't help voters in any other states.

Having said that, I would like to provide some broad (really broad)  data points why I think that taxes will not need to go up enormously.

Lets take for example that US spends 3 times what US spends on healthcare, per capita.

That gives us a big margin to cut costs, even though we cannot come quite close to UK's cost, we can atleast cut our current costs by 50% (by removing private insurance profits, administrative costs and having bargaining power with the healthcare providers and drug companies).

The current costs of healthcare spending in US is 3T, cutting that in half would bring us to 1.5T which is pretty close to what Sander's plan says.

I would also like to highlight that under current ACA and thus its expansion in Hillary's proposal, the tax payers are still forking out for the subsidies offered to the employers and the market insurers.

If we agree with the above analysis that we can potentially cut the healthcare costs, then, another place where the government (both state and fed) will save a ton of money is on the health insurance the government provides to the employees working for the government.

Just adding to this. It's not only deciding what is/isn't covered, it's also deciding how much to invest in different types of treatment, geographical areas, etc.. 

Here in Canada, we do have some debates over what should/shouldn't be covered (e.g. in vitro fertility: http://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2015/10/01/ohip-to-cover-in-vitro-fertization-treatments.html).

E.g. in Alberta, there was a fierce debate a few years ago about whether private MRIs should be allowed at all. Some argued that they should be banned because they allowed people to pay to jump the queue for public services (faster diagnosis means faster treatment); others argued that they relieved pressure on the public system, lowering wait times for everyone.

Is this true, though? According to OECD data, the United States spends more per capita on health care than any other member nation by far. 

It goes so far that the US government (i.e. public spending) already spends more on health care per capita than most countries that have guaranteed health care for everyone. On top of that, private citizens spend an almost equal amount for health care out of their own pocket—an amount that's effectively zero in other countries.

Canada is a good example.  Medicare is run by provinces and pays a fixed amount for any procedures.  There is some limited private insurance, as well, but hospitals are a mix of private and public institutions and they pay their bills using the Medicare payout. (info here: http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/health-system-systeme-sante/system-systeme/index-eng.php)

I also don't believe that you're thinking of Medicare (for the elderly) in the US, but rather Medicaid (for the poor), which pays out paltry amounts (according to studies like this http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/32/9/1560.full).  I gather that Medicare can sometimes pay out under current costs, but hospital costs (like any business) are set by the nature of how much income there is vs how much services is provided, quantity of resources used, etc.  

Regardless, as with any other government program, they are often designed with a review board who can easily changed if hospitals are going out of business.  Medicare prices in most countries are set according to the common good.  If hospitals regularly fall behind, they will raise payouts to ensure it works out for them, as it's obviously not in the public interest to have no operating hospitals due to funding issues.

Nobody will get rich owning hospitals, however.  On the other hand, currently, in the US, many hospitals are grossly underfunded (due to lack of insurance) (a discussion of this is here, referencing 703 hospital closures due to funding issues   http://articles.philly.com/2006-06-15/news/25402675_1_emergency-care-emergency-room-hospital-bed), while others make huge profits (due to high payouts from private insurance and wealthy patients).   More discussion on hospital profitability and how there is such a dichotomy is here: http://truecostofhealthcare.net/hospital_financial_analysis/

That dichotomy is almost universally divided among class and racial lines and is one of many very divisive issues in the US that is less present (but not absent) in other developed countries that have single-payer or universal health care.",2016-02-24T21:40:47+00:00

So I don't know that it's really fair to look at the ACA and say because it didn't reduce costs much, the public option wouldn't either. There are different mechanisms in each, for sure.

[This proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Affordable_Health_Choices_Act_of_2009) would have allowed any citizen to buy into the federal medicaid program, but would not have required any additional federal subsidies.  It would offer a slightly lower cost alternative to compete with existing insurance companies.  

It's essentially a mirror of a program that existed under Bush.

>The Medicaid Buy-In program is part of a broader federal effort to improve
employment outcomes for people with disabilities. Authorized by the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997 and the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act
of 1999, the Buy-In program allows states to expand Medicaid coverage to workers with
disabilities whose income and assets would ordinarily make them ineligible for Medicaid.
States can customize their Buy-In programs to their unique needs, resources, and objectives.
This flexibility leads to considerable state-to-state variation in three outcomes that are key
measures of program performance: enrollment, employment, and earnings. This variation
also creates an ideal opportunity not only to examine the relationship between program
design features and program outcomes, but also to identify which features can lead to
improved employment outcomes for people with disabilities

Taken from [The Three E's:
Enrollment, Employment,
and Earnings in the
Medicaid Buy-In
Program, 2006](http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/~/media/publications/PDFs/EEE_FinalReport_Apr2008.pdf) (paywall)

The public option seen in [HR 3200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Affordable_Health_Choices_Act_of_2009) appears to mirror this program, but using medicare rather than medicaid, and it likely would not include the same level of subsidy protection.  The authors of the study I linked above in fact suggested that the program may be expanded and found that it was largely successful in its goals.

Alternatively, she could go even further and split from medicare entirely.  If for-profit insurance companies can make money in these markets, a government alternative should be able to offer slightly lower rates, but not so low that other companies aren't competitive.  They could recycle any profits into providing need based subsidies.  This would be part of the ACA and would not replace existing government programs like medicare and medicaid, though it could eliminate a good amount of waste in those programs.  It would be essentially profit neutral, though likely with significant startup costs which could potentially be repaid to the treasury over time.  I'm not saying this is a plan that has been proposed, just describing an example of how I see a public insurance option working.      

This is distinctly different from a [medicare for all plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer_healthcare) in which the government simply provides free insurance subsidized by taxes.  That could be quite harmful to the private insurance company, though it may be possible if arranged so that the government covers basic healthcare and private insurers move more into specialty care.  It's still a significant benefit to buy private insurance, and it doesn't break the employer based health insurance system, but it serves the government's interest in providing basic health services to all citizens.  

I'm not really sure which plan is more politically viable, but my guess is neither has a huge chance of getting through a Republican congress.  

I personally think the public option is preferable.  It fits into the ACA very well and builds on the system we have.  It is encouraging that [multiple studies](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-7295.2000.tb00027.x/abstract;jsessionid=938E7DA6CB3820F7EC18FFA69CF64F8E.f03t02?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=) seem to confirm that the original medicaid expansion was successful.  It would put downward pressure on healthcare costs without crippling the existing insurance companies which would have significant economic impacts.  Plus it doesn't add to the deficit since it is profit neutral, and could potentially remove some pressure from medicaid and CHIP by providing a more affordable private insurance option for marginal poor.

There are studies, however, that contradict the predictions made in the others I have linked above. In [Health Insurance Reform: The Impact of a Medicare Buy-In](http://www.nber.org/papers/w18529), the authors conclude that most people would not purchase competitively priced public insurance, because people are more comfortable with what they already know.  They conclude that the only way to get a significant number of people into the program would be to subsidize it.  Encouraginly, though, they did find that 
> If the the Medicare buy-in is
priced differently depending on an individual’s age, a 17 percent subsidy is sufficient to bring the fraction
uninsured below 5 percent. In addition, those of age 36 or higher (34 if there is pricing by age) would prefer
to live in a world with a subsidized Medicare buy-in program than in the benchmark economy without this
program.

So I guess this became more an answer to OP than to the comment I replied to, but I hope I was able to at least clarify what is being discussed as public option and add some data to the discussion.  I regret that I don't have enough time right now to do a properly researched analysis of the single-payer option, but hopefully someone else will chime in.

we could get around this by making the penalty tax so high that no one would forgo insurance, or we could also just mandate everyone have insurance, and provide some kind of credits to subsidize the purchase for small businesses and self employed users.

It may or may not have an impact on you in 2018 depending on your insurer's solvency, and almost certainly will have an impact in 2019.

---

Long answer:

The [Cost Sharing Reduction program](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/reports/53009-costsharingreductions.pdf) has two elements:

1. A regulatory requirement that insurance companies must give people on silver plans whose incomes are under 250% of the poverty line lower deductibles and copayments.

2. A budget item that gives insurers money to reimburse them for the costs of the lower deductibles and copayments.

The thing Trump is doing impacts number 2, as he's cutting off that money.  But it does not impact number 1.  The reason Trump can cut off the funding is that [a Federal court ruled](https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2014cv1967-73) that Congress never actually appropriated any money for it.  

So what we're left with, pending any new lawsuits, is a system where insurers have to give low-income customers better deals, but have to charge the same price for a silver plan to both low and high income customers.

As such, we would expect that insurers will face the following issues:

* Their premiums for 2018 may now be too low to cover claims, to the extent those premiums presumed that the government would continue to make CSR payments.  Some insurers who have high claims and low margins may find themselves insolvent.  This has happened mid-year before, most notably with New York's [Health Republic](http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20160417/HEALTH_CARE/160419890/a-crains-investigation-shows-how-health-republic-insurance-of-new-york-the-company-that-was-supposed-to-be-about-people-not-profits-misled-its-customers-and-ran-itself-into-the-ground) which vastly underpriced premiums and failed mid-year in 2015. 

* Assuming the CSRs do not get resolved, insurers will base their 2019 rates on an assumption of no CSRs.  That will mean they will enormously hike the premiums for silver tier plans, since those are the only ones which qualify for CSRs.  Interestingly, as the CBO notes in the report I linked above, this may result in larger subsidies/lower effective premiums for persons getting bronze, gold, and platinum plans, since those subsidies are based on the cost of silver plans.  That's part of why the CBO estimates (first link above) this will cost the government money overall.",2017-10-13T13:38:58+00:00
NeutralPolitics,comment,Health insurance marketplace,dobhogk,HangryHipppo,,"This is more a question than a sourced comment, I hope that's alright. If it's not appropriate for this thread I can find another to post it in but I feel like it could be relevant for some people in similar circumstances. 

I am currently enrolled in the marketplace with a silver plan and make a low enough salary to have my premiums substantially reduced. However, because I make a different amount each month and just got the job halfway through the year (so not a full years salary), I decided to continue paying the full amount each month and get money back when I file my taxes vs the potential of having to pay back what I was given but didn't make- I think that's how it works? It's my first year having insurance while being off my mom's plan. 

So my question is if this means I'm out of the money I was expecting to be reimbursed for come april?

This sounds like an AIDS precaution.  Anything dealing with medical precautions about gay sex just smarts of the whole paranoia back in the late 80s.

From the FDA guidance:

> Revised Section III to update the recommended deferral for individuals who had sex with a person who has exchanged sex for money or drugs and individuals who had sex with a person who has engaged in non-prescription injection drug use. 

This was how AIDS was thought to be transmitted during the 80s (""In December 1981, the first cases of PCP were reported in people who inject drugs,"" and ""In June 1982, a group of cases among gay men in Southern California suggested that the cause of the immune deficiency was sexual and the syndrome was initially called gay-related immune deficiency."")

NeutralPolitics,comment,FDA,h3illw2,UnrequitedReason,,"Some of the other commenters have mentioned batch testing, while that is true is some cases, it isn’t always the main barrier (e.g. Canadian Blood Services does not batch test). 

The main issues are 1) risks of the tests being ineffective (it can take up to three months for HIV to be detectable in the blood) and 2) costs of having to throw out contaminated blood. Donating blood is not free; it is actually quite expensive and time intensive to attract donors, hire nurses to extract the donation, transport the donation, and test the donation. Taking blood from a population where a large portion of the donated samples would need to be thrown out is losing valuable money and resources that could be better spent attracting viable donors. 

The general best practice is to allow donations from men who have had sex with men if it has been several months since they have engaged in sexual activities. This minimises the risk of the tests not catching HIV positive samples. However, the  sample of the population that requires blood transfusions is one of the most vulnerable in terms of health, so donation programs will likely ways prioritize their safety over the “right” of certain groups to donate blood.

The forms that are being filled out are not intended to be long discussion about your relationships, it's not intended to be some holistic thing where every single risk factor narrows it down as much as possible.

Let me give you an example; people who spent 3 months or more in the UK between 1980 and 1996 cannot donate.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1116429/

This is in response to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.  It was an issue with meat.

They don't ask specific questions about vegetarianism. They simply cut out a huge swath of people and error on the side of caution.

There are many parts of the world that are just completely cut off from donation. Trips to Africa often result in limitations or outright bans from donation for similar reasons.

https://www.mskcc.org/about/get-involved/donating-blood/general-blood-platelet-donor-guidelines

So this is the same behavior that is done with all of their rules, no special treatment no discriminatory treatment, the same treatment.  It's how the restrictions work.

The rules are simply based on the widest and most accurate broad strokes.  Which specifically comes down to MSM. It is not LGBT, it's just based on the numbers.   Lesbians for example are extremely good donors because of their extremely low rates of bloodborne diseases.

Don't get me wrong, I fully understand how at a cursory glance it could seem discriminatory. Especially when you have a group that has been hated and discriminated against as much as those affected by this.

But it's not.  It's just boring science with boring numbers that happens to overlap with a social issue.

Even if the population who gives blood is equal to US population s[say ~209 million adults](https://www.infoplease.com/us/census/demographic-statistics). (7% of hiv new infections yearly are drug users - I don't have facts for this - but we can be pretty sure don't donate blood)

If .0166 % us population newly infected HIV *2 = .0332. * 8 mm = 2656 of those 8 million hiv+. * 1.525 donations each = 4050 positive donations?

Say we batch in 100 (i can't find a source). 12.2 million / 100 = 122,000 batch tests.

I think that would mean a .0331% chance of a 'bad' batch test?

**Or only 40.38 positive test batches I think - out of 122,000 batches?**

Even if I'm off somewhere by an order of magnitude it's still only 400 batches out of 122k.

But does someone understand this time distribution sourced in parent source? I'm guessing it has to do with probability that distributions aren't even. Like I could roll a 5 5 times in a row but not super likely, but small deviations in absolute small numbers could give larger deviations type of thing?

I can't find a source but what is the cost of throwing out a few batches of blood? Is it worth the discrimination?

The leading questions reveal my opinion.

Also what about allowing MSM on PrEP (who are not infected) to donate? If it's truly about only cost savings on testing rather than discrimination and long held bias.

To quote a few:

>David Cutler: Let me give you three reasons why. The first one is because the administrative costs of running our health care system are astronomical. About one quarter of health care cost is associated with administration, which is far higher than in any other country.

>The second reason health care costs so much in America is that the U.S. spends more than other countries do on many of the same things. Drugs are the most commonly noted item, where a branded drug will cost much more in the U.S. than in other countries. But, for example, doctors also earn more for doing the same thing in the U.S. than they do in other countries, and a lot of suppliers charge more for things like durable medical equipment in the U.S. than in other countries.

>David Cutler: The third one is Americans receive more medical care than people do in other countries, not so much in terms of doctor visits, but if a person has a heart attack in the United States, they’re much more likely to get open heart surgery than they are in most other countries.

NeutralPolitics,comment,healthcare costs,djigs9x,Freckled_daywalker,,"

There are lots of things we can do to address costs, but the efficacy of a lot of the proposed solutions will be diluted so long as we lack universal coverage. (That's not to say that any of the issues I listed below can't be addressed before universal coverage is achieved, but they'll be more comfortable effective in a population that is fully covered). 

It’s a basic economic principle that the ability to use a good without being required to pay creates a “free rider” dilemma that inevitably results in market failure. Our current system has two such “free rider” problems. 

The first is that, because of EMTALA, hospitals are required to provide emergency care without regard to a patient’s ability to pay. This creates an unfunded mandate for nearly every hospital in the US. While we could repeal EMTALA and let hospitals turn people away, this idea is massively unpopular and would almost certainly be untenable for most Americans. The second free rider issue is that people have the option of delaying getting health insurance until they think they may need it. Our current insurance model only works if a sufficient number of relatively healthy people participate. If you wait until you start to develop health problems to get insured, you are getting the benefit of the healthy people who are contributing without having to bear that cost yourself. The distortion caused by free riders in the Health Insurance market contributes to increased pressure on insurance to minimize reimbursements and transfer costs to patients in the form of deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. The ACA tried to address some of this cost transference issue by instituting out-of-pocket maximums, but most patients have deductibles that exceed their personal savings. ([Max out of pocket costs for non high deductible ACA plans are $6,850/indiv, $13,700/family]( https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/health/managing-health-insurance/whats-difference-deductible-pocket-maximum/), [62% of Americans have less than $1000 in savings account]( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/most-americans-have-less-than-1000-in-savings-2015-10-06)) This means there are going to be more bills for hospitals that go partially or fully unpaid. In 2015 the uncompensated care cost for US Hospitals was $35.7 billion [1]( http://www.aha.org/content/16/uncompensatedcarefactsheet.pdf). Note, that’s the actual cost not the charges. That was actually down by $7bn from 2014, largely due to the Medicaid expansion. This number also doesn’t include underpayments by Medicaid/Medicare or bills contested by PHI companies which result in delayed payments (which affect operating accounts). 

With Universal Coverage you would have a better chance of addressing the following issues:

Management of Chronic Conditions- Half of all adults have at least one health condition. One quarter of adults have 2 or more. In 2010, 86% of all health care spending was for people with one or more chronic condition. Early intervention and proper management of conditions like diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer, etc could have a substantial impact on long term health care spending. How do we encourage early intervention and ongoing management? We have to shift from volume based reimbursement to value based reimbursement . Which leads me to…

Fee-for-service (FFS)- The way we currently reimburse doctors and hospitals is a huge part of the problem. In the current model, we pay for consumption not outcomes.  FFS is a big reason why physicians choose specialties over primary care. There are few incentives to spend time talking to a patient about how to lose weight or to have an in depth discussion on the benefits of getting more exercise, but there is plenty of incentive to perform procedures. Combined with the preference of many patients for “quick fixes” and you have a system where overconsumption of expensive procedures (and medications) is encouraged over a more holistic lifestyle management approach. Moving towards a value based care system like bundled payments for a diagnosis (e.g. you X amount of money to treat a nondisplaced hip fx, which includes all provider costs, testing, hospital stay, meds, etc) or capitated payments for primary care providers (one payment per patient enrolled, per month/year to cover their outpatient care) can encourage providers and hospitals to work toward providing the best care for the lowest costs. These types of payment are typically tied to quality measures and can be adjusted for risk (to ensure hospitals don’t try to avoid taking complicated or high risk patients).  People talk a lot about price transparency for patients but physicians and other hospital staff are the ones in the best position to know what the relative value of a procedure or medicine is in relation to the outcome. By that, I mean, when exposed to prices, patients may avoid getting valuable testing/care that could save them money in the long run because of short term financial constraints. If physicians and hospital staff are also affected by the cost of the care they order/recommend, as well as being held accountable for outcomes, they’re more likely to allocate the resources appropriately.  Capitation and DRG reimbursement can also help simplify…

Standardization of claims/reimbursement processes and rules-  When people talk about administrative costs of healthcare, they’re generally not talking about the CEO’s salary, they’re talking about the ridiculous amount of time and man hours that go into coding, billing, collecting (and sometimes appealing denials) from insurance companies. Every insurer has different rules, different reimbursement rates, sometimes different filing procedures, different appeal procedures, etc. I’m not saying that we need absolutely a single payer but at the very least we need a simplified, standardized process and billing schedule. Maryland’s all payer experiment [2]( http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2017/01/31/marylands-all-payer-model-achievements-challenges-and-next-steps/) is showing mixed results but there may be some lessons we can take and refine for better results in the future. 

Other areas that have potential cost savings: 

-Prescription drug pricing- I’m not going to beat a dead horse, everyone knows this is an area that needs to be improved. Also, ban TV ads for drugs. Edit: forgot to add, utilize PharmDs more for med management. 

-Better end of life counseling, preferably long before the end of life. We spend a lot of money postponing death rather than prolonging life. One quarter of medical costs for Medicare patients are incurred within the last year of life, often on treatment s that have little effect on outcome quality of life. As a whole, the healthcare industry needs to get better at accepting (and helping patients and families accept) when there’s nothing left to do and helping patients die with dignity whenever possible. 

-Mental Health treatment and addiction treatment – Partially for healthcare cost savings but also to reduce the associated costs like loss of productivity, cost of policing and incarceration, cost of homelessness. etc. 

-Leveraging technology – Telemedicine, phone consults, remote monitoring, etc. Reimbursement methods haven’t kept up with technology and we should make sure providers have incentives to use cost saving technology when it’s appropriate.  Also, developing better, user friendly documentation systems where patient records can be made available across clinics and hospitals, to improve continuity of care.

NeutralPolitics,comment,healthcare costs,djia1ei,galapogas,,"There is a lot of inequity in health costs in the US. The majority of healthcare spending is taken up by the 5% most ill patients. This is important when comparing to other countries like the UK where I'm from. The reason for this is, when you get ill in the US, you HAVE to be given the treatment for your problem if you have insurance, the insurance company can't just say no, and the treatment is always there. 

Compare that to the UK, where the NHS can decide it's not cost effective to give you a certain treatment, hence the outcry over the NHS not approving the new breast cancer drug even though it could save lives because it's too expensive. or decide not to train people in certain areas, such as specialised physio therapy. In the US, you would be entitled to these things even though they're expensive, whereas in other countries, they can just say no. So the costs of treatment for the most ill patients in a place like the UK, is a lot less than in the US, because we offer less treatment. 

Unless you want worse healthcare there isn't really any way of reducing this cost.

Another huge part is the difference in prices depending on healthcare provider, you can have one hospital charge $2000 for an MRI, and another down the road charge $400. When an individual has insurance, they have no incentive to choose the $400 over the $2000 one. Insurance has evolved from something you buy to cover insanely high costs such as ER visits and cancer, to something that covers everything from that to doctors visits and basic prescriptions, thus this situation where although the system is private, there isn't hardly any actual competition among providers.

There has been some effort in solving this, high deductible plans have been tried but have not been effective, California state has introduced reference based pricing which has been widely successful and will most likely be expanded. Feel free to explore the variations in cost on https://nhhealthcost.nh.gov/ 

On the point of pharmaceuticals, Americans pay more than most countries because they subsidise places like the UK. When the NHS and European countries negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies, they only take into account the company's cost of manufacture and distribution, and ignore their R&D costs. Bearing in mind it costs over $1 billion to develop a new drug, the company has to make this money up somewhere, and what usually happens is US consumers are overcharged to make up for lower prices in places like Europe. In short, Americans subsidise Europeans, I don't know how you'd reduce those costs, but shopping around using a site like blink health is a start.

You also have to take into account generic vs brand drugs. Brand drugs are usually more expensive in the US, generics usually much cheaper.

NeutralPolitics,comment,healthcare costs,djjhkzm,Archardy,,"There is a lot of bloating of prices from several sources, including hospitals, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies and malpractice insurance. 

I'm not citing sources here, merely sharing some personal examples-

Hospitals- 

We've all experienced or known someone who experienced a situation where a hospital trip ended up with a bill with ridiculous charges on it, like 100 dollars for aspirin, or high costs for things like clean sheets or overnight stays. This is wrong. If they want to work in costs of things like facility fees and so on, then put those on the bill as such.  One of my children was born prematurely, and the cost for her birth was over 20,000 dollars.  In it were things like $1500 a night for my wife staying over night $900 a day for my baby to be in a carseat on a counter in a room with 6 or 8 other babies. $50 a pop for "" prescription strength"" ibuprofen (400 mg instead of the 200 mg otc pills you can buy in massive quantities and just take 2 for pennies instead of taking 1 $50 pill. On and on the bogus fees piled up. That's messed up and needs to be addressed. 

Insurance- 
I did a lot of paperwork for a client that had a very decent insurance policy and had a number of medical issues, so there were hundreds of visits to all sorts of specialists and clinics. This person would go in for a treatment that the facility would charge 3000 dollars for.  The major insurance company would say they pay $400 for that treatment. So the facility would take the 400 and underwrite the remaining 2600. This happened again and again and again with all sorts of businesses.  These businesses would charge a cash customer or an uninsured customer the full 3000 for that treatment and send them to collections within a month if they didn't pay it. 

If the treatment was really costing them 3000 then they should expect my client to pay the remaining 2600, and if they were fine with getting 400, then why in the hell are they charging poor uninsured people 3000 for it?  It's systemically screwed up. 

 Pharmaceutical companies- there seems to be no rhyme or reason to pricing. My family has a couple of prescriptions a month and the costs change all the time and vary greatly by location. For example, for generic adderal, amphetamine salts, the price of a bottle from the same location could jump from 30 dollars a month to 350 a month. The same month, it could cost that much different if you try different various pharmacies. And the different brands act differently. There's orange pills my family member says work really well.  There's purple ones that barely work, and white ones that don't seem to work at all.  Pharmacies sometimes change which brand they carry. There's no easy way to figure out which company has which brand and for what price. This is also messed up. If its the same chemical medicine, then the ingredients should be the same and it should work the same and it should cost about the same. Prices of pills shouldn't be based on things that go beyond factors like cost of materials, advertising, fair profit margins, and reasonable R&D costs. Companies that Jack up costs of critical things like cancer drugs AIDS drugs, epipens etc. Should be investigated. Just because something is life saving, it shouldn't have the costs increased dramatically just because your target audience HAS to buy your product or die. 

Malpractice insurance- I have a friend who is a doctor and has to pay an obnoxious amount of money on malpractice insurance. This is a prohibitive factor for future doctors and current doctors. They become more worried about being wrong and getting sued than they are about helping people get well.

In this first link, compare the relative prices of the name brand drug to generics. Once there are five to seven generics in a marketplace, prices stabilize at about a quarter of the name brand cost. And bare in mind, that comparison is for name brands for which generics are available. Prescription drugs without any generics can basically charge whatever they want, especially if the drug is essential to treat a life threatening condition.

https://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/centersoffices/officeofmedicalproductsandtobacco/cder/ucm129385.htm

The problem is, the patent holders are also heavy lobbyists, and the FDA is culturally obstructionist far more than it needs to be.

**Case Study: Pharma Bro**

http://time.com/4084455/aids-drung-martin-shkreli/

When there's one drug on the market, and that drug is life saving, and there are no other options, then the producer of that drug can charge whatever they want. When Pharma Bro jacked the price up to $750 a pill, he created political outrage that led to the FDA approving a generic, which sold for $1. If Pharma Bro had merely jacked the price up to $50 per pill, it probably would have flown under the radar, and he still would have made extreme profits off of the drug monopoly he was granted in fact by the FDA. If, however, the FDA had already approved a generic, negating the monopoly from the beginning, the original price hike would have been impossible and the drug never would have risen over $1 in cost.

This same story plays out all across pharmaceuticals. Patents and FDA approval create monopolies and duopolies within the pharmaceutical space, which aren't subject to market forces.

**Case Study: Insulin**

Because Insulin is a biologically produced drug, the manufacturers of it can leverage patent law in such a way that their patents never expire, giving them a permanent lock on the market. Fortunately, there's more than one provider for it, but when they collude on price increases, they act as a cartel, again undermining free market price controls.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/health/drugmakers-lawsuit-insulin-drugs.html

The manufacturers can be shown to collude when you track insulin price histories:

http://www.businessinsider.com/rising-insulin-prices-track-competitors-closely-2016-9

So again, a reform in patent law such that biologicals such as insulin's patents for production do eventually expire would break up the cartel, return market pressures to the costing of these drugs, and lower costs *profoundly*.

Here is a source from The Washington Post that the GOP link to which reaffirms their $32 trillion claim:

""The $32 trillion refers to H.R. 676, a Medicare-for-all bill sponsored every year by Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.); the cost estimate comes from a study by the Urban Institute. For the first time, most House Democrats have endorsed the bill, and many can explain how a single-payer system would end up saving money.""

They also link to NPR, who again reaffirm the $32 trillion claim:

""The Health Policy Center (like TPC, a project of the Urban Institute, a D.C. think tank) estimated that Sanders' health proposal would cost the government an additional $32 trillion to what it pays now.""

NeutralPolitics,comment,single payer,dk6e7c6,Excelius,,"National health expenditures are about [$3.35 trillion per year](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/new-peak-us-health-care-spending-10345-per-person/), or about 18% of GDP.  That's all expenditures by taxpayers, private insurers, and individuals.  

Presumably the $32 trillion figure is over ten years, so shifting $3.3 trillion dollars in annual healthcare costs to the government over ten years checks out.

Of course that ignores that government is already responsible for [a majority of healthcare expenditures in the US](http://www.pnhp.org/news/2016/january/government-funds-nearly-two-thirds-of-us-health-care-costs-american-journal-of-pub), and is projected to reach 67% of total healthcare spending by 2024.

NeutralPolitics,comment,single payer,dk6nmph,None,,"Yes. This is according to the TPC, as the NPR story notes. They and the Urban Institute put out [this report](http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/2000785-The-Sanders-Single-Payer-Health-Care-Plan.pdf) estimating the cost. They estimate that the *additional federal expenditures* on healthcare to fund single-payer would be $32 trillion.

I say *additional* because that's on top of what we already spend. However, I also say additional because it means that the federal government would have to spend the money, and it would have to get the money from somewhere.

Where would the money come from? Taxpayers, of course. Instead of paying premiums to insurance companies, they'd pay extra taxes. So they'd save money on premiums and pay more in taxes, which would likely lead to a more progressive (i.e. higher taxes on the wealthy than the poor) tax system and a more equal after-tax income level (i.e. after taxes, the poor would get a boost, while the wealthy would take a hit).

So yes, the government would have to come up with $32 trillion. But the people paying for healthcare right now who pay premiums would save on those premiums, and pay part of those savings in taxes.",2017-07-13T20:53:51+00:00

Why do you assume that the total expenditures would be the same? For one thing, the whole point of this is to provide more care to people who presumably cannot afford it now. All of those extra people getting preventative and other care necessarily increase the total cost significantly.

This also assumes that government's logistical costs for things like billing will be comparable to those of private insurance, whose costs are presumably baked into that $3.35T number.

Finally, you assume that health provider costs will remain constant despite an increase in demand and a decrease in consumer price sensitivity, which seems impossible.

NeutralPolitics,comment,single payer,dk6tqom,None,,"> Yes. This is according to the TPC, as the NPR story notes. They and the Urban Institute put out this report estimating the cost. They estimate that the additional federal expenditures on healthcare to fund single-payer would be $32 trillion.

As of 2015, [the US spent $3.2T on healthcare](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/highlights.pdf). That is TOTAL expenditures, not just government expenditures. At that amount, we already had the highest per-capita healthcare cost [by a substantial margin.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita)

Given that, I find the claim that we would add an ADDITIONAL $3.2T to the budget ludicrous (to $5.1T with the existing $1.9T the government currently spends). That would increase our per capita costs from $9990/person to $15890/person. 

[Edit: The study predicts an increase of $2.5T in 2017, so it would be $4.4T or $13707 person]

I didn't read the study you cited in detail, but a quick read of it suggest that they are assuming costs billed for a given procedure will remain stable, but that we will be increasing coverage and adding millions more people to the healthcare rolls. That is a naive interpretation. There are MANY ways that single payer can save money-- simply getting rid of the ban on medicaid negotiating drug prices would greatly lower the costs.

It is certainly possible, even probable, that single payer would result in a short-term spike in costs as we begin treating people who were previously uninsured, but I don't see any rational argument that the long term costs will continue at that rate. There are simply too many opportunities for cost savings. ",2017-07-13T22:53:29+00:00

The problem with opioids in the US has been a cyclical one, going back to the 19th century, but particularly during and following WWI.  We are drawn to their powerful effects, but we then go through periods of reckoning with the beast we've unleashed.

The source I found to include here:

http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/12/health/opioid-addiction-history/index.html

The modern epidemic began to a degree with a shift in scientific thinking in the 80s and 90s.

>Six years later, a paper by pain-management specialist Dr. Russell Portenoy chronicled 38 patients treated with opioids for non-cancer pain. Two of them had issues with addiction to the drug, but he concluded that ""opioid maintenance therapy can be a safe, salutary and more humane alternative"" to surgery or to not treating a patient with chronic pain.

>The studies by Portenoy and others created a discussion in the '90s around making pain treatment a priority for all patients. Johnson, of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, said that after a heroin epidemic in the 1970s, doctors were concerned about abuse of opioids in the '80s, but things started to shift in the '90s.

>""People started talking about pain as the fifth vital sign,"" Johnson said. ""There was a real push to do a better job of treating pain."" 

Shortly thereafter, OxyContin was introduced as a ""long term"" pain killer.  In a promotional video for the product producted by Purdue Pharma, a doctor said:

>""They don't wear out; they go on working; they do not have serious medical side effects,"" a doctor featured in the video said. ""So, these drugs, which I repeat, are our best, strongest pain medications, should be used much more than they are for patients in pain.""

>A year after the video came out, the overall number of opioid painkiller prescriptions filled jumped by 11 million. 

I know this doesn't answer your primary question, it's just that there was thought to be legitimate reason to turn to these drugs at the time.  This validation likely protects Congress, even if the finding were wrong or even corrupt.

I work in a related field, and I have seen first hand the horrible effects of these drugs.  I've also seen the frustration of a person in intense pain who is now, under new restrictions for the distribution and prescription of this class of drugs, unable to get their hands on the only thing that lets them live a functional life.

NeutralPolitics,comment,big pharma,dp2pqaw,cpast,,"Others have answered about Congress as a whole, but you asked about *members* of Congress. The answer to that is a simple ""absolutely not, under any circumstances whatsoever except a constitutional amendment."" Article I, Section 6 says that:

> [Senators and Representatives] shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.

The first part (privilege from arrest) isn't relevant here; what matters is the second part. It provides members of Congress with *absolute immunity* for their legislative actions before any body except their own House. It doesn't matter if they were doing what they thought was best, were mustache-twirling villains trying to hurt as many people as possible, or even if they were acting a particular way because they were taking bribes. Legislative acts are outside the jurisdiction of every other legal forum. This immunity is so strong that evidence of a member of Congress's legislative actions is inadmissible before any court and for any purpose, at least if the member is a party to the case and the evidence is being introduced by the other side. See, for instance, [US v. Helstoski](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/442/477/case.html). 

The Speech or Debate clause doesn't apply to *everything* a legislator might do, just their legislative acts. For instance, taking bribes is not itself a legislative act or a legitimate part of the process leading up to a legislative act (under federal law, the crime of bribery is complete when you accept a bribe in exchange for a promise to perform an official act). But now you're getting into much more complicated territory, where you have to argue based only on what led up to legislative acts. 

It's worth noting that the clause is intended to prevent exactly the sort of thing you're asking about. Members of Congress are not *supposed* to be accountable to the executive branch or the courts for how they legislate. They are accountable to their constituents and to their House (but mostly to their constituents; for instance, Congressional precedent is that [a member shouldn't be expelled for conduct before their most recent election](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-HPREC-DESCHLERS-V2/pdf/GPO-HPREC-DESCHLERS-V2-2-4-3.pdf)).

The only problem is, I’m not sure if “working in the interest of drug companies with no regard for the lives they might impact” is the same as “acting wrongly with the sole purpose of causing damages.”

No, our tactics are more subtle.

The 5 corporations that control the mass media refuse to cover anyone but the ruling duopoly of parties. Pundits routinely preach that a vote for a so-called ""third party"" is a ""wasted"" vote -- even though every major social advancement the US has gotten is because rising third parties forced the ruling duopoly to move to co-opt the ""threat"" from the third party.

On election day third party results are *rarely if ever* reported. This is the US propaganda system in action.

Today even school textbooks falsely preach that the US is a ""two-party system"" when the Constitution or even an honest reading of history says no such thing.

It might be ugly, it might be decent in some areas, and it's what we've enabled. It's what we the people have regularly accepted & voted into power.

The corporate media conglomerates & social media influencers will do what they can to continually push their candidates of choice but the fact remains the people decide. 

YOU check the box of your candidate. Unless you are just a hapless victim of propaganda and see yourself as incapable of discerning fact from fiction or autonomous reasoning. 

I believe people are more than capable; most just seem uninterested or willing to invest the time before voting. Regardless, that's still their choice no matter what level of money, propaganda, etc. is put into any candidate.

Then if we want to complain about parties selecting preapproved, corporate candidates e.g. not providing a real choice to the voters... my response would be stop voting for your lesser of two evils & promote whoever you believe is the best in the overall race. Speak with others, share your reasoning, etc. I guarantee we are going to see more independent & 3rd party candidates than we've seen in the last century.

AmericanPolitics,comment,Universal healthcare,fnky6s0,IHateClickingLinks,,"**Here is the text for those who dont want to click the link**    

>London (CNN)Like a line of dominoes, country after country has been shut down by the novel coronavirus. Despite signs the threat was making its way across the globe, there was a clear pattern of response in many parts of the world -- denial, fumbling and, eventually, lockdown.

>In our globalized world, it's puzzling that so few lessons were learned in the early weeks of each country's outbreak, when the chances of containing and stopping the virus were highest. Now the focus is on flattening the curve, or slowing the virus' spread, to keep death tolls from climbing further.

>As much of the world mulls gradually lifting lockdowns, there are still lessons to be learned from these four places that got it right. Here are 12 of those lessons.

>Taiwan

>Sitting just 180 kilometers (110 miles) off the coast of mainland China, Taiwan's outbreak could have been disastrous. At the end of January, the island was estimated to have had the second-highest number of cases in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University (JHU).

>But Taiwan, with a population of around 24 million people, has recorded just over 390 cases and six deaths, and yesterday, it reported no new cases at all. It's managed to do that without implementing severe restrictions, like lockdowns, or school and nursery closures.

>In terms of its death toll, at least, Taiwan doesn't even have much of a curve to flatten, more of a line with a couple of rigid steps.

>Compare that to the United States -- now the world's hardest-hit nation, at least in raw numbers -- which has reported at least 26,000 deaths. Even when you take population size into account, a level of success like Taiwan's could have meant just 83 deaths in the US.

>Although Taiwan has high-quality universal health care, its success lies in its preparedness, speed, central command and rigorous contact tracing.

>Lesson #1: Be prepared

>Taiwan's preparedness came largely from some hard-learned lessons from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, which killed 181 people on the island.

>As a result, the island established a specialized Central Epidemic Command Center, which could be activated to coordinate a response in the event of an outbreak. In a sign of how Taiwan wanted to get ahead of the coronavirus, the center was activated on January 20, a day before the island even confirmed its first infection.

>Because its authority was already established, the center was able to implement stringent measures without being slowed down by lengthy political processes. It put more than 120 action items into place within three weeks, according to a list published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). That list alone could serve as a manual on exactly what to do during an outbreak.

>Lesson #2: Be quick

>Taiwan's action came well before its first Covid-19 infection was confirmed on January 21. Three weeks before, within days of China's first reported case to the World Health Organization (WHO), Taiwanese officials began boarding and inspecting passengers for fever and pneumonia symptoms on flights from Wuhan, the original epicenter of the virus in China. The island issued a travel alert for Wuhan on January 20, and two days later, still with just a single case, officials began updating the public in daily briefings.

>A week after its first case, Taiwan began electronic monitoring of quarantined individuals via government-issued cell phones, and announced travel and entry restrictions, mostly targeting China's Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. Just about every day after until the end of February, the government implemented new measures to keep the virus at bay.

>Taiwan had only 329 cases when it imposed strict social distancing measures on April 1. In comparison, there were already 335 deaths and more than 3,000 cases on March 20, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that pubs and restaurants were to close, and that most children would be pulled from schools and nurseries. And as the UK is not testing widely, the true number of infections is believed to be much higher than official figures show.

>

>Lesson #3: Test, trace and quarantine

>Authorities carried out widespread testing and tracing the contacts of infected people, putting them all under quarantine. It proactively tested anyone who got off cruise ships and even retested people diagnosed with influenza or pneumonia, to make sure they hadn't been misdiagnosed and were infected with coronavirus.

>Lesson #4: Use data and tech

>""A coordinated government response with full collaboration of its citizenry [was] combined with the use of big data and technology,"" associate professor of pediatrics at Stanford Medicine, Jason Wang, told CNN. Wang has also studied public health policy and co-authored the JAMA report on Taiwan's response.

>Taiwan merged national health insurance data with customs and immigration databases to create real-time alerts to help identify vulnerable populations.

>""Having a good health data system helps with monitoring the spread of the disease and allows for its early detection. When someone sees a physician for respiratory symptoms, the national health insurance database will have a record of it. It is easier to track clusters of outbreaks,"" Wang said.

>Taiwan used mandatory online reporting and check-ins for 14 days after travel restrictions. It also employed ""digital fencing"" for close to 55,000 people in home quarantine, where alarms would sound if a quarantined person wandered too far from home. The technical surveillance methods used in Taiwan and by other governments have raised privacy concerns from civil society groups.

>Iceland

>Getting a coronavirus test in many countries can be near impossible, unless you're already very ill. Not so in Iceland, where anyone who wants a test gets one. Widespread testing has been crucial to the country's low number of infections and deaths, authorities there say. Only around 1,700 people have been infected in Iceland, and only eight have died.

>Lesson #5: Be aggressive

>Iceland's response to the coronavirus hasn't been particularly innovative. It's just been meticulous and quick. Like Taiwan, its speed has meant it hasn't had to be too restrictive -- people can still meet in groups of up to 20, if they stay two meters away from each other. While universities are closed, schools and nurseries are still open, allowing more parents to work.

>""From the beginning, since we diagnosed our first case, we worked according to our plan. Our plan was to be aggressive in detecting and diagnosing individuals, putting them into isolation, and to be very aggressive in our contact tracing. We used the police force and the healthcare system to sit down and contact trace every newly diagnosed case,"" Iceland's chief epidemiologist Thorolfur Gudnason told CNN.

>""We are finding that above 60% of new cases are in people already quarantined. So that showed that contact tracing and quarantining contacts was a good move for us,"" Gudnason said.

>Lesson #6: Get the private sector involved

>In a public-private partnership between the National University Hospital of Iceland and biotech company deCODE Genetics, Iceland designed tests early and expects to have tested 10% of its population by the end of this week. It aims to test just about everyone and has already become a valuable laboratory for the world to learn more about the novel virus.

>Recent revelations that 50% of the people who tested positive in a lab in Iceland showed no symptoms at all, for example, has prompted other countries to take firmer action through social distancing, as they begin to realize preventing the virus' spread will be more challenging than initially thought.

>Kári Stefánsson, CEO and director of deCODE Geneticsm, told CNN that as of Monday, it had found 528 mutations of the coronavirus in mass testing in the community. These mutations could give insight to how lethal the virus becomes and offers important data to the world to better understand how it operates.

>Lesson #7: Act preventatively

>Icelandic Health Minister Svandís Svavarsdóttir has emphasized speed as a powerful tool, saying the approach is to stay ""ahead of the curve."" The country appears to have done just that. After just six imported cases were confirmed on March 3, Iceland immediately issued quarantine measures for all travelers returning from Italy, and increased travel restrictions in the following weeks.

>The National Police Commissioner declared a state of emergency on March 6, when the first two community-transmitted infections were confirmed. This sent a signal to government bodies to improve their preparedness, but it kept public gatherings as they were, only warning vulnerable people to stay away from crowded places.

>The country closed universities and junior colleges on March 13 and banned gatherings of more than 100 people on March 16, when it had just 61 confirmed cases and not a single death.",2020-04-16T13:15:19+00:00

AmericanPolitics,comment,Universal healthcare,fnky6uf,IHateClickingLinks,,">Three days later, all Icelandic residents that entered the country were required to go into 14 days of quarantine, regardless of where they were traveling from.

>It wasn't until after all this action that, on March 24, Iceland's first death was reported. That same day, authorities banned gatherings of above 20 people and shut down public amenities, such as bars, swimming pools, museums and gyms.

>Lesson #8: Use tech, but respect privacy

>Like in Taiwan, Icelandic officials also made an app available for people to download to help chart the virus' spread. It creates a log of where the user has been. Users don't have to share that data with authorities -- but many do as it helps contact-tracing teams work out who may have been put at risk.

>In comparison, the UK's response has been slow. A government-supported app is only now in the works and is weeks away from launching. As it lags behind in testing, it is only just now looking into public-private partnerships.

>South Korea

>It's telling that South Korea reported its first coronavirus case at around the same time as the US and UK. South Korea is confirming around 30 new cases a day, while in the UK it's around 5,000, and the US it's more than 20,000.

>The way each country tests varies, but their death rates among the population contrast just as dramatically. Fewer than one in every 100,000 people in South Korea's population have died from the virus, while in the UK it's around 18. It's almost eight in every 100,000 in the US, JHU data shows.

>Lesson #9: You can drive-through test

>South Korea's success has been largely down to its testing, according to Dr. Eom Joong Sik from the Gil Medical Center near Seoul. Eom is treating coronavirus patients in hospital and sits on a committee that advises the government in its response.

>""Early diagnosis, early quarantine and early treatment are key,"" he told CNN.

>""Since the first patient was confirmed, by installing more than 500 screening clinics all over the country, we sorted suspected cases and conducted tests, and we have worked hard to develop and maintain a system to conduct many tests with a small workforce over a short period of time,"" he said.

>The country has also been innovative in how it tests. Eom's advisory team had hundreds of drive-through booths, just like at a McDonald's, set up across the country to offer tests that were largely free, quick and done by staff at a safe distance. The US has since replicated that model in some states.

>On March 16, the WHO called on governments of the world to ""test, test, test."" South Korea had already been doing that for weeks, and has to date tested more than 500,000 people, among the highest number in the world per capita.

>Many countries are struggling to carry out thousands of tests each day. It's so difficult to get tested in the UK, for example, that people have been turning to mail-order kits, in an industry that hasn't yet been regulated by the government.

>South Korea was also quick to move, implementing quarantining and screening measures for people arriving from Wuhan on January 3, more than two weeks before the country's first infection was even confirmed. Authorities rolled out a series of travel restrictions over the weeks after.

>South Korea has also been rigorous in its contact tracing, though it was able to do that easily when it realized a large number of cases could be traced to one religious group in the city of Daegu, making contact tracing easier and giving authorities a specific area to carry out intensive testing.

>""By carrying out tests on all members of the congregation and diagnosing even infected people without symptoms, the government carried out quarantine and treatment side by side,"" Eom said.

>Once Daegu was established as the epicenter, authorities were ready with the ability and political will to test broadly, to trace contacts of people infected, and to quarantine them to try and contain the virus before it became a case of mitigating widescale death, as is now the case in much of Europe and the US.

>Lesson #10: Learn from the past

>South Korea was able to move quickly because, like Taiwan and many other Asian nations, it had been burned before. South Korea was mostly unaffected by the SARS outbreak, only reporting three cases and no deaths at all. But it was caught off guard by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2015, when it recorded 186 cases and 38 deaths, making it the worst-impacted country outside the Middle East.

>So the political will needed to enforce measures during the coronavirus outbreak wasn't a problem and there was good coordination between the central government and the provinces.

>It also helped that South Korea is one of the most technologically innovative countries in the world. Much of life there is already conducted online, so developing and enforcing the use of an app to monitor people in quarantine wasn't too difficult, though activists there too have warned of invasion of privacy.

>Germany

>Germany's case is a little different. The country hasn't really been able to keep infection numbers at bay much better than some of the hardest-hit nations. It currently has more than 132,000 confirmed infections, the fifth-highest in the world, JHU reports.

>But Germany has been able to keep the death rate in its population relatively low. More than 3,400 people have died from the virus in Germany, around four people in every 100,000 across the country. That's well below Italy's 35 and the UK's 18.

>Lesson #11: Test more as restrictions ease

>Germany's success has also been its mass testing, but its well-resourced universal healthcare system has played a major role too, according to Martin Stürmer, a virologist who heads IMD Labor in Frankfurt, one of the labs conducting tests. Germany has also drawn in the private sector to make sure enough tests are carried out.

>""From the beginning, Germany didn't stick to one or two or three central labs doing all the tests. Many private companies were involved, so we've been able to do 100,000 tests a day,"" Stürmer told CNN.

>""There are some countries that have done it even better than Germany, in controlling infections, but what's quite important is broad testing, where we were able to see what was happening in our population. Only with mass testing can you identify people who might be infected.""

>Like Taiwan, South Korea and Iceland, Germany devised a test for the coronavirus and prepared a large number of kits early, well before the country even reported its first death.

>As German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced Wednesday that the country would begin gradually scaling back its lockdown, the country is planning on carrying out even more tests, in case the increased contact leads to a second wave of infections. Like many countries, it will also test for antibodies to try and determine who among the community may be immune to the virus.

>Germany's death toll has remained relatively low in part because the coronavirus trickled into the country mostly in young people. Many had been visiting Italy or Austria on ski trips.

>Authorities were able to test people returning to Germany from these ski resorts and trace their contacts for testing too. Most of those people were young, and still today, the biggest age group by infections is 35-59, followed by 15-34. The virus is proving to be deadlier among the elderly around the world.

>But as communal infections in the country grow, Stürmer fears that more elderly people could die in coming weeks and that the country's death rate will go up.

>Germany recorded 315 deaths from complications related to Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, the country's center for disease control, the Robert Koch Institute, wrote on its website on Thursday. This is the first time more than 300 deaths have been reported in a 24-hour span.

>Lesson #12: Build capacity at hospitals

>Germany ranks 18th in the world in terms of access to quality healthcare, according to an index published by The Lancet, sitting above the UK at 23rd and the US at 29th. But these indices only tell us so much. Italy, for example, ranks ninth and the country also carried out rigorous testing, yet it has recorded the second-highest number of deaths per capita in the world, after Spain.

>In this situation, the difference appears to be the German healthcare system's huge capacity. Germany is projected to need about 12,000 beds at the peak of this outbreak in the middle of the month, according to projections from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. It has over 147,000, more than 10 times its need.

AmericanPolitics,post,Universal healthcare,19duvuo,fuzbuster83,A Few Ideas To Fix America,"Correct me if you think I'm wrong, but I think with a few simple platforms, anyone could win the presidency at this stage. If a candidate stood up and stayed true to these talking points, how would they not win a landslide:

1. Wealth Distribution Problem - I would suggest a wealth cap for American citizens. It would still be ridiculously high, but hoarding wealth is a real problem in this country. Jeff Bezos couldn't possibly spend all the money he has, it just isn't possible in a realistic setting. A person who hits that wealth cap must donate to social programs or have their overage seized and redistributed for them. This does not stop them from immediately replenishing what was lost, and in most cases (probably all cases) the missing funds would not impact the citizen at all. The bar would be high enough that capitalism would still thrive, because without it capitalism is dying.
2. Congress Term Limits - Lifelong politicians are a major problem in this country and something like 80% of Americans support putting them in place, but since Congress only works towards their best interests, it hasn't happened. If a member of Congress only has a short amount of time to accomplish their goals and represent their constituents, we could actually get things done.
3. Get Money Out Of Politics - As a perfect segue from point #2, these career politicians are able to accept huge donations from lobbyists for favorable legislation. There is a plethora of information available about how Congress literally no longer represents the people of this country, but instead have become servants to big corporations. A great video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/5tu32CCA_Ig) that will explain how the people you vote into office couldn't care less what you think after they're in.
4. Government Shift To 24x7 or 16x5- There is a great opportunity to combat government overspending on unnecessary things, improve the general public's opinion of government, and double (or triple) government positions. People complain about the IRS hiring thousands of new agents because they're afraid all the stuff they've swept under the rug will get found out. I say hire them and expand on an unheard of level. Someone gets in trouble with the law and has to wait 6 months, a year, 2 years, for their trial? Forget that, judges and local government now works in shifts. Long lines at the BMV? A thing of the past when the offices are now open 16 hours a day and people don't try to rush in all during the 9-5.
5. Healthcare Costs - Honestly, I think if we rolled out #1-#3, this would take care of itself. The alternative to formally take care of it would be to look at other countries with Universal Healthcare, take all the best parts, and copy it here.
6. Border Crisis - Rolling out #4 would have a huge impact on this issue. If it were easier to enter this country by following the processes we put in place then we wouldn't have immigrants coming here illegally. I could point to basically any immigrant I see and find a hard working person just trying to take care of themselves and their families. And if the path to citizenship didn't take years, that person would become a tax payer just like everyone else, and everyone wins.

I think focusing on those issues would be more than enough for one term. If I were running and I didn't get the nomination from respective party, I would be vocal about it. We live in the age of information, and with these platforms that represent the actual people of this country, I'd be shocked if I wasn't assassinated if I did well in the polls.

Anyways, those are just some of my thoughts as I see things spiraling out of control in this country as we race towards electing our last president and evolve into a third world country run by a dictator.",2024-01-23T18:16:32+00:00

So what? That industry is a disgraceful **failure!**

We have the most expensive health care system in the world -- by far! But we only have middle-of-the-road health care statistics compared to other advanced, industrial democracies.

Are we stupid? WTF is wrong with us -- why don't we just copy one of the national health care systems that are *proven* to be *far cheaper* and *far more efficient?* The reason, of course, is that our political system is broken and we're ruled by 2 corrupt, capitalist political parties that do not represent the interests of the American people.

> And we are the most powerful economy in the world.

We're a de-industrialized shell of an economy being held together by propaganda, inertia and financial trickery.

The largest economy of the world is China -- a country ran by a Communist Party. China is the world's largest trading nation. Country after country has *China* -- not the US -- as their largest trading partner and there is no sign that fact is going to change; all the trends are in China's favor.

AmericanPolitics,comment,Single-payer system,e473lgd,miazzelt40,,"> Do you think people become doctors because they care about your health?

I'd say a huge reason is that they want to help people. That's most certainly true for any *good* doctor.

Countries like Cuba, a poor country (but one which has the [same life expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy) -- 79 years -- as the US), has *many* more doctors per capita than the US has. Cuba is famous all over the world for sending medical professionals to poor countries. It's a form of Cuban propaganda (like our Peace Corps) and foreign aid to help poor countries. Hell, during Hurricane Katrina the Cuban gov't offered to send 1000 English-speaking doctors trained exactly in the type of disaster-relief medicine that New Orleans and the Gulf people needed (but we were too proud to accept and our gov't let our people needlessly suffer).

But Cuban doctors are only paid salaries slightly higher than average in Cuba -- far lower than comparable salaries for doctors in the US.

Why is that? How can Cuba do that? They're certainly not doing that by forcing the doctors to be some sort of slaves.

Cuba does that because they value doctors, promote them in the media (etc.) and hold them in high esteem. That sort of thing actually works -- especially in a society/culture where the worship of money is not the #1 priority in life.

Here in the US the gov't does little to encourage medical careers (we constantly have shortages of nurses; many towns have few or no doctors) and the American Medical Assoc. *artificially restricts* the number of doctors which logically alters the supply/demand equation and results in our doctors being high-priced aristocrats.

> They'll sell your spleen to China for 5 cents...

I don't know much about Chinese health care, but I do know that China has 5000 years of history and a *wildly different view and philosophy* about medicine and health than what we in the west have.

The important thing for me is that I remember how horrid the system before Obamacare was. Do you? Do you really? EVERYBODY I knew with a serious illness lost everything they owned. I have two brothers who are dead because they didn't (a) feel they could afford to see a doctor early enough and (b) didn't want to spend the  few thousands it would have cost to stay overnight in a hospital for observation. 

So the ACA is not affordable. I get that and I know it needs to be improved. But under the previous system, I've got nothing but dead relatives and bankrupt friends. I'm all for changing it, but rolling it back doesn't sound good to me. 

Oh, and as a small business owner, the current system for me has been more affordable. I hope removing healthcare from employment will encourage others to open a business.

Not at all. Political discussions are usually off-camera for a reason, partly so each side doesn't feel the need to puff up with bravado for an audience and they can instead focus on the issues/goals that need to be addressed. Trump wouldn't consider making the meeting private. He's aware that he wouldn't have his bully pulpit if there weren't cameras and that he would be accountable to answering Schumer and Pelosi's points rather than creating drama. He doesn't have robust ideas and he lacks real negotiation skills. 

Pelosi: “I think the American people recognize that we must keep the government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything, and that you should not have a Trump shutdown,”

Trump: “A what? Did you say Trump?”

Trump: “You want to know something? I’ll take it. Yes, **if** **~~we~~** **I don’t get what** **~~we~~** **I want** one way or the other, whether it’s through you, through military, through anything you want to call — I will shut down the government.

AmericanPolitics,comment,Deductibles,j2cnv4l,shallah,,"If you’re wondering at this point who these PBMs are, the six largest include some familiar names: CVS Caremark; Express Scripts, Inc.; OptumRx, Inc.; Humana Inc.; Prime Therapeutics LLC; and Med Impact Healthcare Systems, Inc.

The FTC’s June investigation was launched following its February request for information about PBMs and the 24,000 public comments it received as of June. The investigation will look into PBM practices that have been raised in recent years, including:

Methods to steer patients toward PBM-owned pharmacies

Fees charged to unaffiliated pharmacies

Complex methods to determine pharmacy reimbursement

The impact of rebates and fees from drug manufacturers on formulary design and the costs of prescription drugs to payers and patients

The use of specialty drug lists and specialty drug policies

The prevalence of prior authorizations and other administrative restrictions

Potentially unfair audits of independent pharmacies

This lack of transparency — and questionable pricing schemes — in the world of PBMs is increasing the cost of generic medications rather than saving money for patients, governments, and employers, according to research released this spring by the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics.

In some cases, patients and doctors have been denied access to less expensive generic medications and forced into higher-cost treatments that make a bigger profit for the PBM.

According to the paper, these tactics have led to billions in overpayment. When patients — a business owner’s staff — pay more than $100 for a medication they are more likely to abandon or delay needed treatment.

Connecticut has been a leader in passing policies that address some of the most blatant PBM issues. But there’s more work to do — the industry needs to be held accountable because just as states and the federal government find ways to combat these practices, a new one pops up.

Legislation has already eliminated ‘gag clauses’ which prevented pharmacists from telling patients that their medication could be cheaper if they didn’t use their insurance. And a new law will go into effect in 2023 to eliminate ‘co-pay accumulator’ programs wherein PBMs were penalizing patients for using third-party prescription assistance programs by not counting those payments toward the patient’s deductible.",2022-12-31T06:46:26+00:00

The most unpopular president in history stumping for the Republican is encouraging. The tax cut is still slightly underwater but it looks like support for it is increasing slightly. Not sure if that will be an albatross or not. I'm guessing if the Dems can frame it as an anti-PA tax it will be but the GOP is so much better at messaging that it's hard to say.

AmericanPolitics,comment,Medicare,j8m13kt,spaceghoti,,"If you have trouble with the *Times'* paywall, here's the full text of the op-ed:

---

Politically, the most crucial moment in President Biden’s State of the Union address was his declaration that “some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years.” Why did he say that? Maybe because Senator Rick Scott, when he was the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, released a fiscal plan last year with the bullet point “All federal legislation sunsets in five years.”

Seems straightforward, doesn’t it, despite cries of “lies” from the floor? But right-wing news media — well aware that Biden hit a nerve — has gone into overdrive insisting that his claim was false. Even some mainstream media figures have claimed that Biden was “over the top.”

The basis for these denunciations, as far as I can tell, is the idea that calling a plan to sunset legislation a plan to sunset legislation is somehow misleading, because voters don’t know what “sunset” means. Indeed, just because the legislation authorizing a program comes to an end needn’t mean that the program will die; Congress can always vote to reinstate it.

But, of course, many Republicans do want to eviscerate these programs. To believe otherwise requires both willful naïveté and amnesia about 40 years of political history.

First of all, if Republicans had absolutely no desire to make major cuts to America’s main social insurance programs, why would they sunset them — and thus create the risk that they wouldn’t be renewed? As Biden might say, c’mon, man.

And then there’s that historical record. Two things have been true ever since 1980. First, Republicans have tried to make deep cuts to Social Security and Medicare every time they thought there might be a political window of opportunity. Second, on each occasion they’ve done exactly what they’re doing now: claiming that Democrats are engaged in smear tactics when they describe G.O.P. plans using exactly the same words Republicans themselves used.

So, about that history. It has been widely forgotten, but soon after taking office Ronald Reagan proposed major cuts to Social Security. But he backed down in the face of a political backlash, leading analysts at the Cato Institute to call for a “Leninist” strategy — their word — creating a coalition ready to exploit a future crisis if and when one arrived.

To that end, Cato created the Project on Social Security Privatization, calling for replacing Social Security with individual accounts — which George W. Bush tried to do in 2005. By then, however, Cato had quietly renamed its project; “privatization” polled badly, and Bush insisted that it was a “trick word” used to “scare people.”

So there’s a history here, and there’s a similar history for Medicare. Many people probably recall that Newt Gingrich shut down the federal government in 1995. I don’t know how many people realize that Gingrich’s key demand was that President Bill Clinton agree to large cuts in Medicare and Medicaid.

After Republicans gained control of the House in 2010, Paul Ryan began pushing for major cuts in spending. One key element was converting Medicare from a system that pays medical bills to a system offering people fixed sums of money to be applied to the purchase of private insurance — that is, vouchers.

But many though not all supporters of the Ryan plan insisted that calling vouchers “vouchers” was a left-wing smear.

So are people who claim that Biden was over the top unaware of this track record? Do they really not know that Republicans have spent more than four decades trying to find ways to undermine Medicare and Social Security? Are they unaware that there’s a long history of Republicans whining that Democrats are engaged in smear tactics when they describe Republican policies using exactly the same words Republicans used themselves until political consultants urged them to find euphemisms?

Well, I don’t think Biden is going to let up. He knows (as do his hysterical opponents) that his attacks are effective, and he has the facts on his side.

Oh, and one Republican who might be especially vulnerable to Democratic attacks over social insurance programs is Ron DeSantis.

Before becoming Florida’s governor, DeSantis enthusiastically endorsed Ryan’s Medicare voucher proposal and declared that allowing seniors to retire in their late 60s was “unsustainable.”

As governor, DeSantis has made headlines with culture-war attacks on education and his opposition to public-health measures. But in some ways his biggest achievement, if you might call it that, has been blocking the expansion of Medicaid in his state under the Affordable Care Act; in so doing he’s leaving hundreds of thousands of Floridians with no realistic way to get health insurance and is leaving billions in federal funds on the table.

True, Medicaid, unlike Medicare and Social Security, is means-tested. But it’s also extremely popular; DeSantis’s actions suggest that he’s an ideologue who hates social programs on principle.

So to go back to our original premise, when Biden suggests that “some Republicans” want to eviscerate key programs, he’s right; and Ron DeSantis is almost surely one of the Republicans he’s right about.",2023-02-15T08:14:07+00:00

In the real world of reality, Americans pay 2x what Canadians pay per capita and 3x what the British pay per capita for the same health care.  _The current profiteering system of health care is what is stealing your money_.  Instead of giving us the lowest prices as the simplistic theory of capitalism predicts, capitalism is giving us the highest prices in the health care industry.   So it sucks at its basic job.

That is a combination of health care providers lobbying to make sure others can't compete over state lines, defrauding medicaid/medicare because they are worthless programs, and because the price of R and D are pushed onto the American consumers due to other countries drug laws. The USA needs to fix that in a trade deal or the rapid development in new medicines is going to stop. Obama care made the price of my coverage go up but the actual coverage I received became worse. So we need to negotiate better trade deals with other nations, eliminate government medical programs, remove the law saying everyone needs to get medical care in the ER, and have insurance compete over state lines like Trump pushed with the new EO that hasn't been implemented yet that would allow unions and associations to buy coverage over state lines.

We live on land to which we hold title (or rent from the title holder), and the validity of that title is established by the government.

Because the minority shouldn't have their rights restricted by the majority. In the same way that at one point in time the majority thought owning black people was ok, and it was wrong.

The reason their prices are lower is due to laws preventing drugs from costing more than a certain amount. Because of that the companies fuck us over.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Affordable Care Act,kb04gnm,mormagils,,"Conservatives don't like the general idea of having to pay more themselves to improve society generally. The fact that single payer health insurance makes healthcare a collective expense is just a major issue from this perspective. And while Obamacare very much wasn't single payer health care, it was moving away from an entirely private option and in that direction, which opened it up to ideological criticisms independent of the actual specific policy provisions.

On top of that, one thing Obamacare very actually DID do was to raise premiums for a lot of middle class folks. It did a lot of other very good stuff, but specifically if you're a middle class conservative, you've got a concrete policy issue (increased expense specifically for yourself) plus the ideological concerns that don't necessarily have to rely too much on fact (unfortunately).

So it's not really all that hard to see why a specifically middle class conservative might be hostile to the ACA. They are sticking with the repeal idea because they can't come up with any better actual solutions. Quite honestly, the ideological argument is silly on multiple fronts--the basic concept of *any insurance at all* is that when other people make bad choices, that affects your premiums. We *already pay for other people's poor decisions even with an entirely private healthcare system*. But these inconvenient details aren't really the focus of the discussion. 

And you can't really improve ACA because that would in the first place be a capitulation on the ACA being a solid policy foundation, and second because any improvements would likely require further capitulation on policy issues that the conservatives are opposed to. Basically, no country has ever found a way to make conservative ideas for health insurance work in an affordable way for most of the population, and any improvements in the process that we HAVE figured out would be in alignment with liberal policies, not conservative ones. So the conservatives are in a position where the best way for them to make their case is to just highlight where Obamacare sucks and try to get it removed, but avoid any practical conversation about where to go from there.

It's the same issue the House Republicans had when they wanted to get rid of McCarthy. They had a bunch of clear reasons why he sucked from their perspective, but then no actual answers about who was better.",2023-11-27T18:09:33+00:00

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Affordable Care Act,kazy1tl,Kman17,,"Here’s the thing:

Conceptually health care *should not* be prohibitively expensive.

In the crudest comparison… veterinarians go through the same amount of schooling and do conceptually the same procedures. A check up & is 100 bucks, and major surgery is a couple grand. There are several options in midsize cities and they compete against each other.

Yes of medical care is of course more sophisticated and specialized - but like fundamentally it shouldn’t be orders of magnitude more. US medicine just has a ton of administrative layers, legal overhead, and defensive medicine.

The patients ability to research doctors and costs is crazy low.

I think most of us can agree that, conceptually, we want a few things out of health care

* Lower costs, both individual and aggregate 
* Increased transparency while retaining patient choice 
* Eliminate corner cases of unexpected trauma or illness from breaking individual budgets
* Individual incentives / awards for healthy choices 

The problem is that Obamacare focused heavily on the 3rd problem without any real emphasis is on the other two.

It cements a heavily compromised system that is *inherently* inefficient, combining the worst aspects of public & private care.

We probably want to get to a place of *more* socialized base level clinics / ERs, but *less* red tape around elective and higher cost-bleeding edge stuff.

National healthcare would free up so many businesses, notably small business owners, from dealing with the headache of either trying to find their own healthcare or supply it for workers. It's the reason I gave up my own small business - a restaurant. I simply couldn't deal with the healthcare aspect anymore. I tried very, very hard to be a good employer and provide it and it nearly bankrupted me and my business, so I just got out entirely. 

My healthcare would be $2,200 a month without ACA. I get a subsidy, so it is $600 per month. Still a lot, but at least I can afford it. I have a pre-existing condition, so prior to ACA, I coudln't even get insurance, and the last quote I had was $3,780 per month with a $18,000 a year deductible for general care, and an $68K deductible for cancer. That was around 2009.

My pre-existing conditions? I had a rare blood cancer as a kid, and as an adult, I had uterine fibroids and needed surgery. I have been NEC for decades, but they don't care. I had it once, I wear a Scarlet Medical A for life. 

If they get rid of it, then I will end up without healthcare and probably just go bankrupt and also die of some highly preventable or treatable disease and why? Because I'm not a fucking multi-millionaire? 

Prior to the Affordable Care Act, my uncle was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and his insurer simply refused to cover any of his health care costs. So, he tried to pay what he could out of pocket, bankrupting him, leaving his wife and three kids homeless. He eventually killed himself. 

Also pre ACA, my mother's neighbor needed a new pacemaker and his healthcare company (United Health) cut off coverage for this procedure at age 71 1/2. He was 11 days ""too old"" when he got the diagnosis. He appealed and then sold his collectible car and antiques to raise the funds to pay for the procedure in cash, but no surgeon would do it for the cash payment. 

So, he just died. Oddly, replacing a pacemaker is a pretty straightfoward procedure and he had no other health issues, so it's crazy that not a single one of the 11 surgeons he approached would do it if paid for cash. However, they said **if he was a foreign national, they would do it for cash, but not for an American,** because they feared a lawsuit.

AT THE CORE of the ACA was the individual mandate.. and the first to introduce it was a CONSERVATIVE, Mitt Romney - and mind you Romney doesn't consider populist Republicans like Trump and Vivek to even be conservatives at all lol.

Its about risk pools, the law of large numbers, and adverse selection. Really boring academic shit that wont get you any upvotes on social media.

The idea is... Unless EVERYONE is swimming in the risk pool, we are stuck with adverse selection. That is to say, insurers are stuck insuring the oldest, least healthy individuals.. because if you're young, healthy, and don't think ahead.. why would you need insurance until the moment you need it?

So we're back to what is essentially a tax on the elderly where Social Security benefits (which come from taxpayers -> govt -> back to taxpayers upon turning 65) go right to insurance companies! Theoretically, the more younger and healthier people that dive into risk pool allows an even spread of risks. Then, had it not been repealed we'd eventually have a system where when we're older, we'd have younger generations kicking in and so on. Yes, younger higher earners will pay some more in taxes, but LIFETIME costs would have gone down substantially. Not to mention, ya know.. catching up with every other developed country that figured this shit out decades ago.

So in essence, we are paying into Social Security with every wage, and assuming its still around when we're 65.. will go straight towards rising health costs to the already ultra-wealthy insurance companies. They are laughing all the way to the bank! And thanks to Clinton signing Gramm–Leach–Bliley into law, insurance companies can be financial service companies too so its a really short walk.",2023-11-28T02:56:59+00:00

That is a question that has different explanations for different people.

What I believe it is? That gutting these programs will force a society of indentured servants where wealth is almost guaranteed to continue to consolidate. Creating a great burden on individuals who, with opportunity, will try to get ahead themselves but won’t be able to because of debt. 

DEBT. Keep someone indebted and without capital, they will not be able to open their own businesses. And thats for the poor AND middle class. How many times have you heard the stories of the small business owner who had to give it up because of a medical debt? And inflation, the main driver of that over the pandemic and since has been Record Corporate Profits.

Over 58% of the rise in inflation was corporate profit and what does the GOP like? Happy billionaires and stock holders. But if you have a Government entity, let’s say, Public Education, well that cuts into those corporate profits. There’s HUGE donors from the private education industry. Hell, betsy DeVos has something like 10 yachts. So republicans bleed the education budget and when the schools start failing, call for the budgets for failing school systems to be cut and private school vouchers to be paid for by those funds.

And a majority of republicans, if this is explained to them without bias but with facts, they would not support this but the bubble that the right wing media has built around these people has completely altered their view.

You really can’t blame them, I mean, the right wing really pushes their narrative. I was driving down I-75, a road built by democratic socialism, and billboards on the interstate were saying “Liberals are destroying America.”

I wish I could find it again but I once saw Trump basically outline how to win the presidency from back in the 90s, back when he was fairly liberal. Most of what he has done lines up exactly with his plan back then. And since he has won, he has said that he may keep some of ACA, and his more extreme views have vanished from his website. 

There is an extremely small, but non-zero chance that everything he has done so far has been an act. Probably not, and I'm certainly not holding my breath for a sane and rational Trump presidency. But if he started coming out with liberal policies disguised as conservative ones he could actually get laws passed in this insane political environment of congressional gridlock.",2016-11-12T03:13:31+00:00
PoliticalDiscussion,comment,ACA,d9x02u4,Szos,,"Trump doesn't know policy, so he, just might, be able to be swayed on certain things.  But here's the problem... his VP.  Pence is a hardcore right winger.  He won't be swayed and even worse, Trump is going to lean on him heavily because of his political experience.  Pence is also the one stacking the cabinet with other right wing loons.  Even if Trump *might* be open to more progressive ideas, Pence and his team will be sure those ideas never reach Trump or are squashed if they do.  

This is going to be another Republican presidency where the VP is going to be the one *really* calling the shots, and Pence seems even scarier than Dick Cheney.

Same when the South Korean president called him, he immediately went back on making South Korea defend itself.

Expect similar behavior when he's in front of other heads of states: awe and acquiesence.  On the one hand, it's good that all that's needed is a simple phone call or face-to-face meeting and Trump will walk back on the idiot things he said in his campaign about foreign policy.  On the other hand, how will that play out when he's dealing with Russia and China?  Will he acquiesce to their demands too?

Work toward a public health model rather than a catastrophic band aid.

Avoid rolling current insurance employees and leadership into major roles with 'universal' tax funded care- ensure that for profit practices /culture do not continue.

PoliticalDiscussion,post,Single-payer system,6lnben,sagarBNC,"Is America is ""ready"" for single-payer healthcare system?","Right now, the progressive movement is clamoring loudly for single payer healthcare, and we've seen support expressed from all sorts of people, like Warren Buffet. And, despite being introduced every Congress for a decade, John Conyers' Medicare for All bill has attracted more co-sponsors than ever before. Polls have shown that support for such a program is as high as 60%.

On the other hand, we have a lot of voices, both on the left (such as Nancy Pelosi) and on the right, saying that America isn't ready for such a program. Opinions vary widely on whether the American people would support such a large expansion of a government healthcare, especially in the context of reduced out-of-pocket medical costs and universal access to healthcare.

What are your thoughts?",2017-07-06T17:28:10+00:00
PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Single-payer system,djv5fyt,punninglinguist,,"Sure. Medicare and the VA are single-payer systems. Tens of millions of Americans are already on single-payer. It's not a stretch in a lot of people's minds to just give that to everyone, with an option to opt out and buy private insurance. 

That said, single-payer is not the only path to universal healthcare. There are other models like Germany's multi-payer model, where everyone gets free healthcare, but the costs are shared between the government, employers, and labor unions. There's also Singapore's model of mandatory and subsidized health savings accounts. 

The main obstacle to universal healthcare of any kind is that it's so hard to take away social benefits once people have them, the only path for fiscal conservatives is to prevent it from ever happening. That's why they bellow like it's the apocalypse and mercilessly demonize any Democrat who might be President. ",2017-07-06T18:15:07+00:00

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Single-payer system,djvetxt,whitewalls86,,"I struggle with a Single Payer model working for the United States. As others have pointed out, multi-payer systems have proven to be pretty effective in other places, and our only examples of Single Payer systems (VA & Medicare) haves structural problems.

I'm a big fan of government programs, but designing Federal programs in the United States to address the needs of the 300 million people here is a significant challenge. Many people have experience dealing with at least one of the large Health Insurance companies (United, Anthem, Cinga, BlueCross), and those experiences are usually... less than positive. In part, because of the profit motive, but in part because people *hate* dealing with large faceless bureaucracies.

In order to help address this problem, I think it'd be important for the Super Medicare TM to be a *sprawling* bureaucracy. It needs to have call centers for customer service in every part of the country. It needs to have appeals *offices* where people can talk to a person *face to face.*  This type of sprawling bureaucracy becomes increasingly difficult to manage, however. One of the many reasons businesses don't have several call centers is because it costs significantly more. It's harder to recruit/promote/manage your employees. Middle management is farther away from the people responsible for overseeing them.

Honestly, I'm hard-pressed to see a functioning, cost-effective system that has 300 million stakeholders.

---

Aside from the structural challenges with administering Medicare, we need to look at the costs associated with just the care.

One of the huge advantages of a single payer system is the pricing power the government has. Because the government is 'insuring' the entire population, providers have a very strong incentive to price their services at a rate Medicare will reimburse. This negotiating power should be able to help bend the cost-curve of medical inflation. 

However, removing the top end of the 'reward' curve for medical practice will put some brakes on parts of the innovation in healthcare. The speed of research and development will likely slow; if you can only make a 4% profit, you have less incentive to develop new procedures. The incentive to practice medicine will decline; doctors salaries will be limited by the amount clinics can charge Medicare for procedures.

In addition to the challenges involved in properly balancing cost savings and innovation, there are challenges in deciding which treatments should be covered, and in what circumstances. I don't have the statistic handy, but I believe something like 50% of all healthcare expenditures are from ~5% of the population. Americans spend incredible sums of money treating patients who are in their final months of life. Talk of limiting, restricting, or rationing treatments to terminal patients will invoke the talk of 'Death Panels' once again. America needs to have a serious discussion about end of life care, but in our soundbite culture I'm not sure how that happens.

---

In short, no. I think Americans are at the point where a majority of the country believes that everyone should have access to health care, and that getting care shouldn't bankrupt anyone. I don't think we're to the point where most people agree that coverage should come from the Federal government. I'm not sure I agree on that yet.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Single-payer system,djvx6du,Engin3er,,"I do think that America is ready for universal healthcare, but I do not think a single-payer system is right for America.

The reason for this is that we have a lot of people who work in the Healthcare payer side, and shifting away from that will cost a lot of jobs/cause a lot of turmoil. Seeing how CMS/the VA is managed, I also don't really trust our government to operate a single-payer system. Furthermore, most employers already share the burden of healthcare for their employees, and I think they should continue to do so. This way we can divert funds to other social programs (Medicare/Medicaid for people who cannot get insurance from employers and other assistance programs). Honestly, it would just be a form of tax on employers that employers can market as compensation for their employees. 

Keeping a multi-payer system where private insurance companies can compete for both government paid business & private (employer) business seems like a good model to me. We provide coverage to all, and keep competition in Healthcare. Private insurance companies do innovate (e.g. big data analysis for care management, adherence to drug therapy programs to reduce medical costs, digital engagement with members, etc), and a multi-payer model is likely to foster that innovation.

However, I do believe that whatever multi-payer model we put in place needs to be properly established where the government doesn't get completely shafted. The government should be able to pit private companies against each other to get the best deal and best coverage for different types of populations (e.g. people in Texas have different needs than those in NYC, and the government should be able to split up that business to different insurers based on need). This needs to be properly vetted so something stupid like the Medicare Part D amendment that does not allow the government to negotiate drug prices w/ manufacturers isn't put in place to allow rich people/corporations to essentially steal money from taxpayers to line their pockets.",2017-07-07T03:14:32+00:00

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Single-payer system,djvxl3f,pgm123,,"I think there's a lot of groundwork that needs to be laid before America can switch to a single-payer healthcare system and from that sense, America is not ready. Here's what that groundwork would have to be.

1. Americans would have to broadly support a specific program. Polls *do* run as high as 60% support for single-payer, but [polls are actually quite mixed.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/27/how-do-americans-feel-about-single-payer-health-care-its-complicated/?utm_term=.ee152ff7e4f3) Most notably, support drops to 25% if you ask Americans if they'll support it if it increases government spending. You could quite legitimately argue this is misleading as overall healthcare spending should decline if the program is implemented in a way similar to other single-payer systems, but that still is a major hurdle to clear to get support. Likewise, I'd love to see polling that asks Americans if they would like to be moved from their current health insurance to Medicaid or Medicare at a similar cost (or find out what the cost would have to be for them to want that). 

2. You have to design a program that best fits tradeoffs in a way Americans would like. This is really 1a. One of the major cost savings from single payer comes from either (a) excluding treatments that are not cost-effective or (b) paying doctors less for treatments. Countries with the highest-paid doctors tend to have less savings from single-payer. It's not all about negotiating drug prices.

3. There are 2.5 million people who work directly in the health insurance industry. Some will work for the government, at least initially. But any single-payer system will cause layoffs. It's a tradeoff that should happen, but that doesn't mean there shouldn't be a plan for it (hence groundwork). 

4. This is the big one. A gigantic portion of investments and retirements are tied up in mutual funds that are either invested in health insurance companies or are tied to health insurance products. Detangling that will take years, if not decades. Nationalizing and erasing health insurance companies and policies will create a huge financial shock if it is done haphazardly. I have yet to hear a single plan how the government would go about this.

The Nancy Pelosi position is that if the U.S. was creating a health insurance market from scratch, it would do a single player, but since it isn't, incremental progress is the better plan. She has said Obamacare is the step towards singe payer, but the House plan was better. The House bill had a public option and a Medicare buy-in. Independent Joe Lieberman single-handedly killed it. In part that's because the insurance industry creates a lot of jobs in Connecticut, but he also was pretty conservative for a former New England Democrat. I personally subscribe to the idea that you can't rush to single-payer for the reasons I described above. But those are the four things that are 100% required to ready America for singe-payer.",2017-07-07T03:23:28+00:00

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Single-payer system,djv6iz5,None,,"Yes.

By their own accounting, Federal, state, and local government combined spend $1.5 trillion on healthcare or $4,600 per capita.[1] For this amount, we could purchase Canada's healthcare system _right now_ and government would still spend less money.[2] That is, single-payer can be implemented without any new tax revenues and even allow a small tax cut. But, wait, there's more. Because employer-provided health coverage is untaxed, the Federal government alone would take in up to $250 billion in additional revenue as those health benefits are converted into wages.[4] This means that, taking a cautious outlook, single-payer would permit three times the tax cut of the Senate healthcare bill while achieving universal coverage.[5] An optimistic scenario, where all the savings are realized and all the new tax revenue from higher wages arrives, would provide nearly six times the tax cut.

I've owned several homes. I avoid seacosts, flood plains and tornado alley locations. I live in Maine, where its damn cold in the winter and hot, humid and filled with lots and lots of bugs. We've got an awful lot of trees that are frequently knocked down on powerlines, causing ower outages. Neither the government nor the insurance company covers me for those events. I knew about them before I moved to Maine and I've adapted to it. I've got my own septic system and my own generator. On the good side, hurricanes, droughts and tornados are rare. Yes, we have floods, but I chose to live in a high elevation area so I don't have to deal with floods.

I resent having to subsidize the poor decisions of others.

I think that would result in tremendous political changes.

Once Republicans get over their Trump illness and get back to being the party of personal responsibility, they will reap the benefits.

Democrats seem to hate the notion of personal responsibility. ""It takes a village"" ""You didn't build that!"" ""Social Security"";  bail out rich idiots who have deposits in one bank in excess of what the FDIC insurance covers.",2023-08-12T15:39:36+00:00

For example, some estimates suggest that Marine Cloud Brightening might cost several hundred million to several billion per year.

The hurricanes that hit Florida alone over the last five years cost a bit under 50 billion.

If Florida and California hit enough departures by insurance companies, it could be cost effective for them to engage in Marine Cloud Brightening to reduce the costs the state would potentially be stuck with.

Florida and California are also relatively large states and as such each section of the state is not exposed to the same level of risk.

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,Insurance,jvw6wf9,Hartastic,,"Companies that insure property typically do do so based on estimated reconstruction cost rather than market price of the home.

The problem more is probably that with the rise in hurricanes etc., the cost of an insurance policy that fully covers replacement in the event of the house being totaled by a hurricane is prohibitively expensive.  You're no longer insuring against a very rare event with risk that can be managed, covered by reinsurance, etc.   

So either you sell policies that explicitly exclude the kinds of damage you actually care about (and I don't know if or how long mortgage companies tolerate that), or you're selling a policy that probably costs more each month than the mortgage on the home itself, and I don't know if you can make money doing either but you definitely can't make money assuming that now relatively common event is rare.

What can politicians even do about that?  I don't know.  America as a whole could choose to federally insure people in hurricane flood zones etc. at a continual loss, but why?  I don't feel like that would be politically popular for really anyone to burn money on that.",2023-08-12T17:18:40+00:00

So if insurance companies believe wildfires will continue to grow as a problem in the future (which seems pretty likely) that cannot be reflected in the rates they charge right now. Additionally there is a California law that caps how much insurance rates can increase each year. If the federal government were to pass a law that prevents insurance companies from leaving California those companies would be forced to take catastrophic losses as they cannot, by law, charge a rate for insurance that is sustainable.

* Do not forget Obamacare also has other benefits such as helping the lowest income class with medicaid

* Do not forget Obamacare also got rid of the pre-existing conditions, lifetime limits, and prevents your health insurance from dropping you on a technicality once the health insurance figures out you have something expensive yet keep you on if you are healthy.

Instead, provide a tax benefit to both the employer and employee when the employer funds a worker's HSA (which the employee can also put funds into).

There should be no limit on the size of the HSA, it should be able to roll over, and is transferable between family members.

At this point, allow for a ""public option"". Roll all existing federal healthcare programs into this new program, including medicaid, medicare, schip, VA, etc. If you were otherwise not eligible for government subsidized healthcare, you can elect to buy into the system via monthly premiums and co-pays.

The double standard deduction is a fakeout.

People got $6k standard + $4k personal for $10k total.  They eliminated the personal and raised the standard to $12k.

So basically, they only increased it by $2k, which will save you about $400 total.  But they also raised if you have kids, you lose the additional personal exemptions and it's a tax *increase*.  And if you don't have kids, the 2% tax increase will make up for that $400 tax savings if you make a little more money.


I'm not totally against the idea of using standard deduction expansion as a method for helping the poor, but this is a fakeout.

There's been a huge campaign of bad information though, which makes this an unlikely event.  The people who have been left out are more likely to think ""I can't afford insurance **because** of Obamacare.  And now I'm penalized for it.""  It's simple cause and effect.  They were chugging along without insurance in their hourly job just fine, and now suddenly insurance is no less expensive, but they pay a penalty for refusing it.  And no one is sitting on their shoulder saying ""Well the reason for this is something called the Medicaid Expansion which I'll explain if you just give me 15 minutes...."" So it's a pretty simple conclusion when you don't know/care about politics.  Obamacare is a failure, because all it does is tax them hundreds of dollars at the end of the year for not having insurance.  Done.

However, this is a stark contrast to the proposed changes to the AHCA in order to bring the Freedom Caucus on board.

If the older boomer generation in their 50s are struggling to get health care because of preexisting conditions, and those people mostly vote R, I assume that Republicans will put those interests into great consideration when making a revised plan, even if it comes at the expense of a few donors. Donor money doesn't always win elections as this season taught us.

I do think that millennials, which are more likely to be non-Caucasian and thus tend to be less Republican, will be hit hard by any AHCA revision done by Trump or the GOP congress because it wouldn't lose them votes.

The freedom caucus is in my view, on the way out. It is too extreme and is a by-product of the hate for Obama, so the group will fracture under Trump.

What the GOP was offering for years before trump came along was just as ridiculous. They just had the sense to use adult language, hiding behind the phrase ""repeal and replace"" while never explaining what that replacement might look like.

They're completely stuck, imo. Before it was obamacare, the system we use now was romneycare in ~~Maryland~~ Massachusetts. It's maybe the best compromise between a market-based solution to healthcare and being a reasonable country. And now they've made it blasphemy to support.

The problem Republicans face with coming up with a plan is that Obama took and implemented basically what their own plan would have been some day.

But that is what Obama did.  So what can they do now?  It's already privatized, but they want to attack Dems over it for political gain.  So that means claiming it is bad, getting it dismantled, and going back to the old system of private health insurance with still high premiums and lousy plans.  Pre-existing conditions?

I’m disappointed that this thread isn’t particularly referring to any of the thousands of studies and policy proposals from somewhat legitimate conservative think tanks and instead opts to just come from a sort of armchair pundit perspective.

To summarize: Healthcare is broken in America because of deliberate government policies. Incompetent monetary policy during WW2 used wage controls as a means of controlling inflation. These wage controls created the incentive for employers to offer fringe benefits such as healthcare insurance instead of wages. Before WW2 the inflation adjusted average expenditure on healthcare was $100 annually. 

After WW2, Congress caved to pressure from labor unions to not tax healthcare compensation, and so the massive government created distortion remains. And Obama’s ACA cemented this government created monstrosity by requiring that employers provide healthcare.

The Republican “plan” goes in line with the general philosophy that you cannot fix a government created unintended consequence by giving the government further control over the sector. Immediately end the healthcare compensation deduction, roll back the employer requirements in the ACA, implement universal catastrophic care in exchange for completely deregulating healthcare insurance, expand HSAs, etc..",2020-11-10T22:58:10+00:00

PoliticalDiscussion,comment,FDA,jfl14pa,HeloRising,,"People may want to be *real* careful with this ""fetal personhood"" concept.

If we accept that a fetus is indeed a person, endowed with all the rights that a US citizen has, that raises some potential avenues that are...disquieting.

For instance, anyone carrying the fetus acting in any way that could harm the fetus could be subject to criminal charges. Someone who's pregnant having a glass of wine could be endangerment as could sitting in the front seat of a car. Improper prenatal care could also be grounds for these charges, something that's going to become a real problem considering access to comprehensive prenatal care is much more limited for people who aren't wealthy.

Additionally, if a fetus dies there is now a chance that the person carrying that fetus could be subject to murder charges if it was determined that any action they took helped lead to the death of the fetus. Even if no action they took led directly to the death of the fetus, the case could be made that the parent's *inaction* led to the death, opening the door for manslaughter charges.

There's also the question of imprisoning someone who's pregnant. There's already a case about this that, as far as I'm aware, hasn't been decided on yet but it makes the relevant point - to imprison someone who's pregnant is to imprison the fetus. Since the fetus is now a person, you are imprisoning a person for a crime it had no part in. That generally doesn't play well in our legal system.

This is frankly unsustainable.  The US healthcare system is the most expensive in the world by far.  It's on the brink of collapse.

After negotiations are done on ""The Public Option"", the new addition to the ACA will be nothing more than elaborate price negotiations with private insurers the public could make. 

Let's say that the public option passes. In that case, private insurers, who's main goal is to make a profit, will transfer their most at-risk patients onto the government plan while keeping younger healthier denizens for themselves. Such an action will burden the public option system to the extent that costs will eventually increase to maintain it. 

Single-payer is the ultimate answer. Healthcare should be a human right and no one should have to undergo 36 chambers of price negotiations with private insurers to see a doctor.

It is not a single payer system. It is a partial single payer system. The vast majority of your care beyond primary needs must be paid by yourself or private insurance.

Generally medication of any kind is not covered. Including cancer medication. 

Dental is never covered, even for emergencies.

But let's just do a little example with cancer:
One month of cancer treatment is about 4000€ and analysts estimate the annual revenue on $48 billion of all companies worldwide. 

This would mean the curing drug would have to be more expensive than 4000€. Still this would just compensate the loss of one single month, but cancer treatment usually takes longer than just one monts until it is effective. Thus for companies it is indeed more profitable to sell and research better medicamentation than to research and sell a cure.

EDIT: In the case of cancer I would dare to claim that pharmazeutic companies have no interest in a cure, while with other diseases the whole scenario may change of course and it may become more profitable to invent a cure than to sell medication.",2012-12-03T17:10:18+00:00

It doesn't seem that tuition would be the reason students leave New York since out-of-state tuition is typically higher than in-state tuition but, to the extent it is, perhaps offering free tuition will help New York retain some of those students who are leaving the state in order to attend public universities in other states.

With respect to the impact on other states, I suspect the greatest impact will be on neighboring states where New Yorkers are currently allowed to pay in-state tuition.  Assuming students can get admitted to public universities in New York, they may be more inclined to go to them as opposed to, say, universities in [Connecticut, where the state has more institutions of higher education than it does students to fill them](http://www.courant.com/opinion/op-ed/hc-op-rennie-ct-state-universities-spending-0911-20160908-column.html).

I suppose an influx of these college-bound students could make admission to NY public universities more competitive, increase class sizes, require the hiring of additional personnel, and/or potentially create overcrowding problems, all of which might increase costs for NY state taxpayers beyond the cost of foregone tuition.  Those concerns are perhaps best outlined in the article here:  [Hillary Clinton’s College Plan Appeals to the Left, but Educators Have Doubts](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/us/politics/hillary-clinton-college-education.html).",2017-01-03T21:33:09+00:00

Not that we don't need more, but small changes at the local level, such as the parks dept running a free compost heap for all local residents can help promote local growing of fruits and vegetables, which lowers carbon emissions, promotes healthier eating, etc ...

climatechange,comment,Insurance,kilq86z,BigMax,,"It's going to be interesting to see how migration starts to be affected as insurance rates start to skyrocket in various areas.

I think they'd going to go up across the board, as there isn't a single spot free from added risk, but obviously some are MUCH worse than others.

An interesting initial effect might be just driving out lower income people.  The wealthy can take these hits for a while, a 22% increase (in just ONE year!) on average is something wealthy folks can grumble about and ignore.   But that will start to put a major hit on lower income folks, especially retired folks on a fixed income, they can't adjust much to account for increased costs like that.

I wonder if you'd ever see states competing based on that?  For example, for years states have fought each other to cut spending and give that money to corporations to move there.  Texas being one of the biggest ""beneficiaries.""  (I say beneficiaries in quotes, because it's arguable whether it's good for your state to get more jobs at the expense of damaging education and other things to get them.)

Turned out that this engine runs like a Toyota on regular gas, and runs line a Lexus on premium gas.

When I ran my Toyota on premium gas, the engine was quieter because the engine computer had more options for adjusting the ignition timing.  But I couldn’t measure an increase in MPG.

climatechange,post,Deductibles,1byreoc,Aggravating-Drop1581,Human caused climate change. Th math doesn’t make sense. I need someone smarter to help.,"So I’m having trouble with the whole climate change narrative. I definitely believe the climate is changing. That is super apparent.

What I can’t understand is if humans impact on the climate is really that…for lack of a better word impactful. 

I’m on my phone so it might look weird but here’s the facts that I have that are easily verifiable. Let me know if I’m looking at the math wrong. 

According to [NASA](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html) the volume of the entire earths atmosphere is 5.1 quintillion kg in total. If we look up the makeup of air and use the portion of CO2 and other trace emissions as a rough base for the composition of the atmosphere we get [0.04%](https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/atmosphere) of the total atmosphere according to the NOAA. 

Using some quick math deductions we get a total of 204 quadrillion kg of CO2 present in the atmosphere. 

Now according to the International Energy Agency that monitors global emissions as of 2022 we produced [36.8 GIGAtons](https://www.iea.org/reports/co2-emissions-in-2022#) of emissions for the year. And that’s up by almost 1% over the previous year. Even then that only accounts for 0.00018% of the 0.04% that is the total CO2 in the atmosphere. 


To put it in my perspective just to get to a little under 2% of personal human contributions we would have to produce CO2 at the levels higher than we ever have for 100 years. That seems like a lot for a long time. 

On top of that according to this article from [Yale](https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-the-world-passed-a-carbon-threshold-400ppm-and-why-it-matters) the parts per million/ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen to historic levels at a rate of 5ish ppm per year(im approximating here cause this post is already long) but if it were linked to our usage of fossil fuels wouldn’t it go up at the same exponential rate?  

Listen I have questions and if anybody can tell me the right numbers I should be looking at so I can believe like the rest of you lemme know but these are the numbers they give us and it looks weird.



EDIT: I’d like to thank everyone for the information and corrections. Like I said in the title I needed help from someone smarter and I’ve definitely gotten more explanation than my google search could give me lol. I’ll continue watching the post if any new sources I should read or revisions I should look into comes up. ",2024-04-08T06:59:24+00:00
climatechange,comment,Deductibles,kyl5soh,Constant-Parsley3609,,"At first glance the numbers don't seem wrong to me. It's more or less in line with numbers I have seen before.



There is a lot of CO2 produced by nature, but nature also absorbs a lot of CO2.


Our small contribution causes an imbalance, and so CO2 slowly increases.


This increase is very small and very slow, but the heat trapping effect of CO2 is significant enough that even a small adjustment in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is going to impact the global temperature.



It should be noted that this effect on global temperature is small. Currently the temperature is about 1.3°C more than it ought to be. Now, if your weather man said it was 18°C outside and then said ""oh wait, scratch that, it's 19.3°C"" I don't think you'd change how you approach the day. It's a small temperature change.


But the world is a big place and increasing the average temperature of the world by a small amount requires a lot of trapped extra energy. Nature can do some destructive things with energy. It's not ideal for us to be increasing the amount of energy at nature's disposal every year.",2024-04-08T07:19:19+00:00
climatechange,comment,Deductibles,kylcy8w,Neat_Chemistry_4694,,"Without time to go too much into it, you seem to have some units confused. The 5.1*10^18 kg is the mass (not volume), while the 0.04% is in mole fraction (number of molecules, 400ppm). The 36.8 gigatonnes again refer to mass. From what I can find, 1ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere is 2.13 gigatonne Carbon (molecular weight 12), or 7.8 gigatonne CO2 (molecular weight 44). ~37 gigatonne CO2 would then increase the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by ~4.7 ppm, but taking into account that 50% of that is absorbed again by ocean and biosphere (not certain about this number and happy to be fact checked), we should see increase around 2-2.5 ppm. Over 10 years we would expect an increase of ~20ppm, which seems to agree well with the data. Isotope analysis of the CO2 in the atmosphere also seems to confirm that the change in isotope ratios change as expected from burning fossil fuels, which have a lower C13/C12 composition than what is found in the atmosphere.

Sorry for not having time to find and provide sources, and some of my numbers might be off, but still I think the key point of your misunderstanding is that you are mixing units.",2024-04-08T08:49:40+00:00

I started doing a little research myself about 6 years ago after a chance conversation with, of all people, the insurance agent for my company (small commercial contractor). The insurance company is owned by his family. Started by his parents, taken over by his older brother. Over lunch one day I commented that after college, he pretty much knew that he would be in the family’s insurance company. He surprised me by telling me he had gone to school for marine biology. He grew-up on the water and his life-long dream was to be a marine scientist . After college he worked as a marine biologist for about 8 years. Said he loved every minute. Begs the question, “so why are you selling insurance in your family’s business?” He said that he fell in love and wanted to start a family. I took that to mean there must be more money selling insurance than in marine biology. This was the red pill moment for me. He explained that all research science is funded by private, state and federal grants. Yes, his organization has funding this year and maybe next year but it can be taken away at any moment. It is difficult to raise a family not knowing if you have a job next year. The cynic in me couldn’t help but to inquire, if this is true, could it be a possibility that researchers might skew their data/conclusions such that it would encourage the “grantors” to continue to fund their research? He said that happens every day and climate change is the biggest cash cow on the planet. Said every CC researcher knows the quickest way to loose your funding is to suggest that man may not be the cause. He had a personal experience involving research he was doing along with an older woman (married, house, kids). The research was about why a particular microbe in the Chesapeake Bay seemed to be on the decline. The data didn’t support the narrative and conclusion that she proposed that would require further research. The young biologist graduate (my agent) called her out and said that her conclusion wasn’t supported and he wouldn’t put his name on it. Of course, when you are single, still living at home with no bills and no mortgage, you can have the luxury of morality.

climatechange,post,Public option,mc91yw,LooseCannonPyro,Whats your opinion on nuclear power?,"In my opinion nuclear is a clear and valid option for fighting climate change. Without it, reducing carbon emissions will be much harder. The topic around nuclear technology has a reputation that was earned, and past reactors have had their fair share of problems. But despite that, nuclear power still ranks lowest on deaths per unit of energy produced. On the topic of waste, current reactors in the US can only use about 3% of the energy stored in the fuel before it must be removed and stored. 
New technologies and reactor designs have made reactors that are much much more efficient, which will lead to much less waste. Some of these reactors even operate at atmospheric pressure, so theres no chance of a pressure explosion from an accident. There are even fuels that have been made that actually physically cannot melt down.
All this sounds good, but none of it has been used. Most of the nuclear plants in the US are 30+ years old. This is largely due to the costs associated with building a new nuclear plant. Without a firm backing from climate organizations, the general public, or governments, energy companies don’t have much of a reason to invest in these new technologies.

climatechange,comment,Public option,gs2ghxj,diederich,,"I follow a fairly straightforward logical procession.  (To be clear, I have been a 'bright green' environmentalist since the 1980s.)

If one believes that climate change, at a minimum, has a moderate chance of being an existential threat to human civilization in the foreseeable future, then all steps that aren't worse than that should be carefully examined, and be considered 'on the table'.

Currently, nuclear power is expensive, slow and financially risky to implement, and very rarely causes large localized environmental messes.  However, even considering all of the relevant factors, the electrical power it produces is extremely climate change friendly.

Logically speaking, these factors, by themselves, with no other changes/progress made, should cause society to go full force into building as much nuclear power as possible.

Note: work on all kinds of renewables should not slow down; they should speed up.  Technology and engineering necessary to bridge the renewable storage gaps is moving along, but we should encourage it to move faster.

If we were able to magically delete the nuclear power boogie man out of people's minds, then I'm pretty confident that we'd be able to deploy it in the relatively near term future in ways that are exceedingly safe and cost effective.  The basic physics of the problem are on the side of fission based power being able to be both safe and cheap.

Nuclear waste is a nasty byproduct, but a pretty trivial problem in the grand scheme of things.  Right now, there's about 300,000 tons of nuclear waste world wide.  That's a big number, but not really.

Plus, I think there's a good chance that, with appropriate research and funding, effective fission power can be deployed in the not too distant future that produces a lot less long lasting waste.

One way or another, those that believe that CO2/CH4 driven climate change *might* be an extreme threat to human civilization must step out of past fears and ways of doing things and seriously consider nuclear power.  Not at the expense of renewables; I would much rather most of our civilization's power come from clean renewables, and we very well may get there, but I firmly believe that fully embracing nuclear power will allow us to move away from the production of greenhouse gasses far more quickly than we otherwise could.",2021-03-24T16:55:54+00:00

\- There has been a dramatic increase in wells running dry in the South East & North West sections of the Central Valley. The ground in certain areas has sunken 10-28 feet due to aquifer depletion. Once this happens the water does not come back underground to that location. Areas in the North West Central Valley that typically get 12.5 inches of rain have only gotten 1.5 inches. The grass in that region did not have enough water to complete their life cycle and dried two months earlier than what typically is expected. The worst areas were in West Shasta County and West Tehama County, but water depletion was observed throughout California interior landscapes.

\- There are emerging implications of the drought as Central Valley farmers leave more than 400k acres empty. Normally vast landscapes of watered crops have a cooling effect on the local climate through evaporation, but this year dry empty fields will likely cause drier air this summer and allow temperatures to get much hotter in the Central Valley, a region which already gets triple digit heat.

\- Due to the water shortages many hydroelectric dams will be unable to operate, which utility companies are warning in advance will cause outages during peak demand in summer. This could be a cascading effect causing a dramatic spike in heatstroke among local residents. Unfortunately we are also predicting a very severe fire season this year, which will also impact both on-grid and off-grid solar for extended periods of time, possibly even months. This combined effect could leave many people running on generators while gas prices are already extremely high.

\- Zone Blue #1 Northern Coastal areas are still predicted to remain most habitable (from Marin County to Del Norte), Coastal Humboldt County and Coastal Del Norte County seem to have the healthiest ecosystems currently out of all samples we have taken. Plant and soil moisture levels are optimal in these locations at the present time even though elsewhere there has been drought degradation in nearly every other region in California. We believe this is likely due to the region's ability to generate it's own precipitation from Coastal fog. The mountains seem to do a better job at trapping the coastal air in this region, which allows the clouds to reach dew point after they enter at night and form nighttime drizzle occasionally. This area also benefits from cool ocean air during summer causing evaporation to be slow. The ecological health of this region is the only positive news we have to report during this term.

\- Unfortunately in the Sierra mountain range & the Eastern Mendocino mountain range there has been unprecedented tree die off both from drought and from a snowstorm during winter that caused a build up of heavy snow on branches. This caused drought affected trees to buckle and break during winter. But as the branches and trees dry out during summer it will add to the fuel load during fire season. This alone will increase fire risk. But worse even is that the surviving trees that were damaged heal themselves by increasing resin output. We have measured it this year, and there is significantly increased resin that could cause the trees to become extremely dangerous if they catch on fire, possibly to the point of explosive combustibility. If there are fires on either of these mountain ranges it often causes extended smoke accumulation in the Northern Central Valley which could lead to unsafe air quality for cities such as Redding, Red Bluff, and Chico.

\-The last three years have been La Nina years. Which causes cool surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. This usually creates a cooling effect over the West coast of the US, but unfortunately it has had very little impact at stopping the extreme summer heatwaves which inland California has been experiencing annually. We do worry about how high the temperature could climb once La Nina has finished it's cycle, because this year Earth has reached it's highest CO2 content to date. Additionally La Nina should cause increased precipitation for Northern California, but instead there has been far less.

\-Comments: We are witnessing a rapidly changing climate, and we've been working hard to document as much as possible. We believe that just as inland Southern CA is a desert, inland Northern CA will also soon become a desert. Desertification is happening all around the world right now, and this is where we are observing it happen here. 

\[\[ Original Post below \]\]

For a college project my group spent half the year studying regions in California for their future habitability as climate change progresses.

We researched both on the ground and using public climate and event records.

The regions listed above are 2 high risk land areas and 2 climate refuge land areas.

As simplistic as our presentation is our findings are based on lengthy and rigorous studying. Please be respectful in the comments because I am not going to argue with anyone on here. Often people that dispute the facts are either personally invested in high risk areas or they are climate change deniers. I don't have the patience for either. The reason I'm posting this on reddit is to gather public responses before our presentation.

The purpose of the presentation is to reach out to developers so they can start preparing housing and business in safer locations as the climate crisis continues.

* (High Risk Zone: Red #1) The Central Valley is a low lying flat region. Most of the central valley is going to be high risk, but the highlighted area is of particular concern. In this area high population cities such as Sacramento are located. The elevation in Sacramento is 26ft. When people think of areas impacted by sea level rise, most people think of coastal areas. But the reality is for California most of the land impacted by sea level rise will be the Central Valley region. Most coastal locations in California are situated far enough above sea level to be safe. Los Angeles for example has a elevation of 305ft and will continue to be well above water inundation. Unfortunately for low lying inland cities such as Sacramento, the rise will overwhelm infrastructure. Ground water will likely get pushed up from underground before ocean flooding even arrives. This region is also heavily impacted by wildfire smoke because the central valley acts like a bowl trapping the smoky air in. The region is already known to have some of the worst air quality in the nation, but the increase in wildfires is adding an extra air quality hazard on a regular basis.
* (High Risk Zone: Red #2) The Western facing Sierra foothills is the highest risk wildfire zone in California, and likely the highest risk zone in the United States. The elevation of the sierra foothills is 500 ft - 4000 ft. You may think at those elevations that the climate would feel cooler, but as someone who has a lot of personal experience in this area that is not the case. Unlike the Central Valley, the Sierra Foothills does not have access to the delta breeze, which is a cool coastal wind that provides relief on hot summer days to the Central Valley. Additionally those elevations are not high enough to create a cool summer climate and the added UV impact in this hot climate just makes it sting to be in the sun and heats up houses faster. The air heats quicker at this elevation which causes a larger portion of the day to be hot. 90F in the sun at this elevation often feels worse than 100F in the Central Valley. Las Vegas for example is 2000ft elevation and is the second hottest City in the United States. The summer heat in this region is often underestimated. Recently a young family in Mariposa county died because of heat stroke while on a morning hike. Wildfire risks here are high. 60 percent of rain in California falls in the Sierras. But it all dumps down within a few winter months and then it quickly gets hot and dry for more than half the year. The high winter precipitation creates a lot of brush that burns. High winter Rainfall and the hot dry summer which has only been getting hotter and drier is why this area is such a fire risk. Additionally the types of vegetation that grows in this region burns hotter than most woods. Not all forests are equal when it comes to fire risk. Unlike coastal California, the humidity inland is vastly reduced and fires thrive in the dry air. Humidity levels in the foothills are often as low as 5% because extra moisture doesn't arrive from the delta breeze. Even after severe wildfires a new wildfire can happen every year due to the dry grasses and the fact that organic matter on the ground takes years to decompose during the extended dry times. This means that even the top soil can burn. Paradise CA and Greenville CA which both completely burned down within the last few years are located in zone Red#2. The cost alone for fire insurance in high wildfire risk zones is around 5-10× more to insure. Which will suppress development for businesses and farms in these areas. All this combined makes the Sierra Foothills area one of the least habitable regions based on our data.
* (Refuge Zone: Blue #1) The Northern California coast has elevated topography that will not be impacted much by sea level rise. Additionally the cool ocean air gets trapped into the coastal region making the air cool and moist. The trees in the coastal belt of far northern California are more likely to moss over than burn. Additionally the coastal winds that move West to East and mountain range shelters the area in from most wildfire smoke even when there are fires blazing inland. This area particularly stands out as a refuge away from extreme heatwaves. For example during the Pacific Heatwave of 2021 Redding CA was nearly 120F while Eureka CA was 65F-70F at the same time. Summers and winters in the area are mild, and as climate change continues this region will likely be one of the most comfortable climates in the United State. We predict this area will soon be a extremely desirable location to live due to the weather. Similar to how Santa Barbara is in present day.
* (Refuge Zone: Blue #2) The high desert region in southern California will be considered a climate change refuge because of the lack of flammable vegetation. Although it does get hot here, as wildfires continue to get worse a new appreciation for desert life will likely arise. Additionally because there is very little forest upwind of this area, wildfire smoke will be less of an issue compared to most other interior regions.

Closing thoughts:

We would like to be a voice of encouragement for developers and investors to utilize these less populated refuge regions in order to prepare the near future population for displacement and climate change related disasters. The only long term cost effective solution is a slow preplanned migration.

There are other risk and refuge locations that we identified in our research, but these are the areas we found to be most significant. We wanted our presentation to be easy to understand as a guide for development.

I have been a resident of California for 50 years and have sadly seen the decline of the ecosystems and changing climate. As well intentioned as your proposed refuge regions may be, I think it is just kind of postponing the inevitable and not facing or addressing the reality. Do I really want to abandon 90% of California just to escape the decline. This is a short term bandaid that allows one to ignore the problem head on. Either we save the whole of California or just face and accept a bleak and dire future. I for one am not fine with watching the forests of the Sierra go up in flames or die from massive bark beetle infestations.

climatechange,post,Health insurance marketplace,w3w69z,ProactiveVerb,California Climate Change Risk VS Refuge Zones (Update #1)," (Update #1) 

\- There has been a dramatic increase in wells running dry in the South East & North West sections of the Central Valley. The ground in certain areas has sunken 10-28 feet due to aquifer depletion. Once this happens the water does not come back underground to that location. Areas in the North West Central Valley that typically get 12.5 inches of rain have only gotten 1.5 inches. The grass in that region did not have enough water to complete their life cycle and dried two months earlier than what typically is expected. The worst areas were in West Shasta County and West Tehama County, but water depletion was observed throughout California interior landscapes.

\- There are emerging implications of the drought as Central Valley farmers leave more than 400k acres empty. Normally vast landscapes of watered crops have a cooling effect on the local climate through evaporation, but this year dry empty fields will likely cause drier air this summer and allow temperatures to get much hotter in the Central Valley, a region which already gets triple digit heat.

\- Due to the water shortages many hydroelectric dams will be unable to operate, which utility companies are warning in advance will cause outages during peak demand in summer. This could be a cascading effect causing a dramatic spike in heatstroke among local residents. Unfortunately we are also predicting a very severe fire season this year, which will also impact both on-grid and off-grid solar for extended periods of time, possibly even months. This combined effect could leave many people running on generators while gas prices are already extremely high.

\- Zone Blue #1 Northern Coastal areas are still predicted to remain most habitable (from Marin County to Del Norte), Coastal Humboldt County and Coastal Del Norte County seem to have the healthiest ecosystems currently out of all samples we have taken. Plant and soil moisture levels are optimal in these locations at the present time even though elsewhere there has been drought degradation in nearly every other region in California. We believe this is likely due to the region's ability to generate it's own precipitation from Coastal fog. The mountains seem to do a better job at trapping the coastal air in this region, which allows the clouds to reach dew point after they enter at night and form nighttime drizzle occasionally. This area also benefits from cool ocean air during summer causing evaporation to be slow. The ecological health of this region is the only positive news we have to report during this term.

\- Unfortunately in the Sierra mountain range & the Eastern Mendocino mountain range there has been unprecedented tree die off both from drought and from a snowstorm during winter that caused a build up of heavy snow on branches. This caused drought affected trees to buckle and break during winter. But as the branches and trees dry out during summer it will add to the fuel load during fire season. This alone will increase fire risk. But worse even is that the surviving trees that were damaged heal themselves by increasing resin output. We have measured it this year, and there is significantly increased resin that could cause the trees to become extremely dangerous if they catch on fire, possibly to the point of explosive combustibility. If there are fires on either of these mountain ranges it often causes extended smoke accumulation in the Northern Central Valley which could lead to unsafe air quality for cities such as Redding, Red Bluff, and Chico.

\-The last three years have been La Nina years. Which causes cool surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. This usually creates a cooling effect over the West coast of the US, but unfortunately it has had very little impact at stopping the extreme summer heatwaves which inland California has been experiencing annually. We do worry about how high the temperature could climb once La Nina has finished it's cycle, because this year Earth has reached it's highest CO2 content to date. Additionally La Nina should cause increased precipitation for Northern California, but instead there has been far less.

\-Comments: We are witnessing a rapidly changing climate, and we've been working hard to document as much as possible. We believe that just as inland Southern CA is a desert, inland Northern CA will also soon become a desert. Desertification is happening all around the world right now, and this is where we are observing it happen here. 

\[\[ Original Post below \]\]

For a college project my group spent half the year studying regions in California for their future habitability as climate change progresses.

We researched both on the ground and using public climate and event records.

The regions listed above are 2 high risk land areas and 2 climate refuge land areas.

As simplistic as our presentation is our findings are based on lengthy and rigorous studying. Please be respectful in the comments because I am not going to argue with anyone on here. Often people that dispute the facts are either personally invested in high risk areas or they are climate change deniers. I don't have the patience for either. The reason I'm posting this on reddit is to gather public responses before our presentation.

The purpose of the presentation is to reach out to developers so they can start preparing housing and business in safer locations as the climate crisis continues.

* (High Risk Zone: Red #1) The Central Valley is a low lying flat region. Most of the central valley is going to be high risk, but the highlighted area is of particular concern. In this area high population cities such as Sacramento and Stockton are located. The elevation in Sacramento is 26ft and Stockton is 13ft. When people think of areas impacted by sea level rise, most people think of coastal areas. But the reality is for California most of the land impacted by sea level rise will be the Central Valley region. Most coastal locations in California are situated far enough above sea level to be safe. Los Angeles for example has a elevation of 305ft and will continue to be well above water inundation. Unfortunately for low lying inland cities such as Sacramento, the rise will overwhelm infrastructure. Ground water will likely get pushed up from underground before ocean flooding even arrives. This region is also heavily impacted by wildfire smoke because the central valley acts like a bowl trapping the smoky air in. The region is already known to have some of the worst air quality in the nation, but the increase in wildfires is adding an extra air quality hazard on a regular basis.
* (High Risk Zone: Red #2) The Western facing Sierra foothills is the highest risk wildfire zone in California, and likely the highest risk zone in the United States. The elevation of the sierra foothills is 500 ft - 4000 ft. You may think at those elevations that the climate would feel cooler, but as someone who has a lot of personal experience in this area that is not the case. Unlike the Central Valley, the Sierra Foothills does not have access to the delta breeze, which is a cool coastal wind that provides relief on hot summer days to the Central Valley.

I will say that I find the idea that the high desert in Southern California would potential refuge area somewhat puzzling. The NYTimes, I think, did some analysis about expected days of extreme heat (I wish I could remember the source, as it's come up in conversation a couple of times with my friends since then) and my takeaway from that was that inland areas of Southern California would likely be uninhabitable because of the frequency of extremely hot days and the infrastructure and safety challenges they create. 

(My takeaway from that analysis that I can't remember was very much do not buy an investment property in Joshua Tree, which several people I know are doing).

climatechange,comment,Health insurance marketplace,ih08f6g,SlowBear5,,Interesting read and analysis. I second the comment about the high desert. I don’t think water issues were addressed but I’m not sure if you weren’t looking at that. The dust and air pollution problems from dry lake beds from reduced water (Owen’s Lake and not exactly in the area but similar issues with Mono and Salton Sea) could be an issue for air quality in the future. The heat in those regions could definitely be extreme and with reduced snow pack in the Sierra there is little chance for water resources beyond import from the Colorado (doubt LA will give the Owen’s valley water back anytime soon/ever). I would expect that there will continue to be growth along the interstate corridors but don’t see it being a “refuge”. Finally regarding fire risk the area can get natural lightning and have very high winds and can sustain large fires in some cases (mojave preserve Dome fire).

climatechange,comment,healthcare,l03mxyh,WikiBox,,"It is governments that are responsible. They make laws and regulations. To some minor extent also businesses, but they compete based on what is legal. It is governments that need to say what is legal and give insentives via taxes, fees, education and subventions as well as what infrastructure is built. And then let individuals and businesses do what they think is best.

But then, in a democracy, the government is elected by individuals.

Businesses compete on the market and in the end individual customers choose who to buy from. 

So you could say it is 100% the responsibility of individuals. Or say it is 100% the responsibility of an elected government. Or anything in between. And it would in principle still be the exact same distribution of responsibility.

Say 75% government. 20% businesses and 5% individual responsibility.

essentially there are concerns that talking about individual action and sustainability efforts is a way industry has weaponized it as a way to take attention off themselves.

I live in Canada (Eastern Ontario), and in thinking about ""generational wealth"" (I'm not 'wealthy' per se; I make less than $100k a year, but compared to the rest of the world I know I'm privileged), so, thinking about my future family, and reading this book, my brain thinks it would be of great benefit to buy land in Northern Ontario for my son and his future kids, as it feels like in 50 years, the climate up there will be prime real estate because of climate change.

But thinking bigger, if this theory is correct, would not the vast beautiful land of Northern Canada be a wonderful place to create a haven for climate refugees?

I know I sound Pollyanna.  There are indigenous rights to be aware of, there are immigration laws, there are myriads of other factors to think about, like access to healthcare and such.  But.

Introduction

The ""Cold Earth Initiative"" is a forward-thinking project aimed at drastically reducing global carbon emissions through a combination of advanced renewable energy technologies (solar, wind, tidal), reforestation, and innovative carbon capture techniques. This proposal elaborates upon prior discussions, providing an actionable and detailed plan to reverse the adverse effects of climate change by integrating sustainable practices across different ecological zones globally.

Project Overview

Objective: To implement a multi-faceted global strategy that not only reduces carbon emissions but also promotes environmental rehabilitation through renewable energy, reforestation, and enhanced carbon capture technologies.

Duration: The initiative is projected to span 30 years, during which full implementation and scaling of the technologies and strategies are expected.

Total Project Cost: The project is estimated to cost approximately $3.3 trillion USD, representing a significant global investment into sustainable future.

Scope: The project includes extensive installation of solar panels across 50% of the world’s suitable hot deserts, wind farms on uninhabited islands, and reforestation in arid regions using methods proven successful by China’s greening efforts.

Financial Details

Funding Strategy:

•	Global Contribution Model: This involves an equitable cost distribution among the world's population, exempting those below the poverty line and low-income families, to ensure fairness and feasibility.

•	Individual Contributions: By excluding financially vulnerable groups, the burden is shared among approximately 3.6055 billion people.

•	Per Person Cost: Each person is expected to contribute $915.18 over 30 years, which breaks down to about $30.51 per year.

Projected Financial Outcomes:

•	Break-Even Analysis: The initiative is designed to break even within 100 years, considering savings from reduced energy expenditures and economic growth spurred by emerging industries related to renewable technologies.

•	Post-Break-Even Profitability: After the break-even point, substantial profits are expected due to decreased operational costs and increased efficiency from mature renewable energy technologies.

Environmental Impact

Carbon Reduction Goals:

•	Solar Panels: Implementing solar panels in desert areas could generate significant electricity, effectively decreasing reliance on carbon-heavy fossil fuels.

•	Wind Farms: The strategic placement of wind turbines on uninhabited islands will harness potent wind energies while preserving ecological integrity.

•	Reforestation: Turning arid regions into thriving forests not only sequesters carbon but also restores biodiversity and stabilizes ecosystems.

•	Tidal Power: Including tidal power projects enhances the mix of renewable energy sources, providing consistent and reliable power outputs.

Total Emission Reductions: When fully operational, the initiative is expected to significantly cut global carbon emissions, aiding in the stabilization of global temperatures and contributing to international climate goals.

Social and Economic Impact

Job Creation:

•	This project will likely create hundreds of thousands of jobs worldwide, spanning various sectors including construction, engineering, maintenance, and operations.

Economic Development:

•	By reducing global dependence on expensive fossil fuels, the project will lower energy costs and foster economic growth in newly developing sectors like renewable infrastructure and environmental restoration.

•	Comparison with Other Initiatives: Similar to the job creation seen in major infrastructure projects like the U.S. Interstate Highway System, which not only built extensive road networks but also significantly boosted local economies through job creation and increased commerce.

Health and Environmental Benefits:

•	Improved air quality and reduced health risks will decrease medical costs and enhance quality of life. This is similar to the benefits observed from other large-scale environmental initiatives like the Clean Air Act in the U.S., which significantly improved air quality and reduced pollution-related health issues across the country.

Global Participation and Equity

Responsibilities of Partner Countries:

•	High-Income Countries: These countries are expected to contribute more, reflecting their higher economic capabilities and historical contributions to global emissions.

•	Middle-Income Countries: They will contribute according to their economic capacity but will also benefit from technology transfers and capacity-building to boost their local industries.

•	Low-Income Countries: These nations will receive support through international aid, ensuring that they are not overburdened financially and can still benefit from the project's environmental improvements.

Risks and Challenges

Technical and Logistical Challenges:

•	The sheer scale and complexity of the installations pose significant technical and logistical challenges, similar to those encountered in global initiatives like the International Space Station, which required extensive international cooperation and technical expertise.

Environmental and Social Risks:

•	Potential disruptions to local communities during construction phases must be mitigated through careful planning and stakeholder engagement, drawing lessons from projects like large dam constructions, which have historically led to significant environmental and social impacts.

Consequences of Inaction

Accelerating Climate Change: Without decisive action, the progression of climate change could lead to catastrophic natural disasters, mirroring scenarios predicted in climate models that show increased frequency and intensity of weather events. Economic Strain: The costs related to inaction, such as disaster recovery and increased healthcare spending, could far exceed the investments outlined in this proposal, similar to economic analyses of prolonged wars which drain resources and stagnate economic growth. Biodiversity Loss: The ecological degradation could mirror the mass extinction events of the past, permanently altering life on Earth and disrupting food chains and ecosystems. Social Instability: The potential for climate-induced migration and conflict could increase, akin to historical conflicts fueled by resource scarcities.

Conclusion

The ""Cold Earth Initiative"" represents a comprehensive approach to tackling climate change, modeled after successful global initiatives that have shown significant long-term benefits despite high initial costs. This project is not only an investment in environmental sustainability but also in economic stability and social well-being. Its success hinges on global cooperation and a commitment to a sustainable future, emphasizing that despite the daunting scale and cost, it remains a necessary undertaking to ensure the planet's health and humanity's survival.

TL'DR  


Cover 50% over the deserts and islands in solar panels and wind turbines, it will cost a lot, but it might actually work. spreading the cost over whole planet will reduce each individual contribution to $36 USD per year for 30 years.",2024-04-20T02:40:50+00:00
climatechange,comment,healthcare,l0efqj1,tinyspatula,,"A couple of things that could be an issue with the proposal:
Solar panels in the desert. Deserts, being arid places have a lot of loose sand/dust and tend to be windy. So the panels are going to get coated and not receive the direct sun and also I imagine the abrasive wear is not great. The other thing about the desert is nobody lives there so you have to send the power over very long distances. As far as I'm aware, this results in significant losses due to resistance etc. 


Another issue huge infrastructure projects in remote locations which also applies to the uninhabited islands, is it going to need a lot of fossil fuel to power all the construction along with energy for the workers accommodation, transport etc. Once you add in the embedded emissions from manufacturing this could end up being a very carbon intensive project, which would initially make things worse.",2024-04-20T04:03:02+00:00
climatechange,comment,healthcare,l0fvyly,Reaper4435,,"Yeah, those are both real concerns. I believe in other desert power plants. They auto tilt at the end of every day cycle, dropping accumulated sand and debris on the floor.

We would be adding to the problem initially. But once the infrastructure is in place and we start making major cities carbon neutral, the payoff swings back to a negative carbon impact compared to before we began.

Over 30 years, when the project is completed, we will be seeing approximately 10% reduction in fossil fuel consumption. Which is a massive win for Earth. 

Over 100 years, assuming our focus is renewable energy driven technologies, we would see a profit actually. Both financial and, more importantly, carbon emissions. 

That, added with the new green zones. Wastelands converted to rainforests using China's Green Wall Technology.  We can actually hold this planet together, and all it will cost us is time and money. But the Earth won't keep going forever. Even if we only implement this project after we exhausted our fossil fuel resources, it would be too late.

We need this project or something like it to start in the next 25 years. Otherwise, we'll all be cosying up to Elon asking for a place on Mars.

And we haven't even discussed the potential for species extinction on all those uninhabited islands. When mankind comes stomping through to save the planet.

It's a hard pill, but whatever we do, we need to start...soon",2024-04-20T12:32:12+00:00

guncontrol,post,Affordable Care Act,v8p8nb,AccomplishedAd196,Gun Control? Its pretty obvious.,"There's not really anything to cite, it's pretty common sense. Guns just don't have a place in our society. 

Everyone asks what we can do to prevent school shootings or mass shootings, or suicide in general. We know the answer, it's just that we don't want to do it.

When a kid does something bad, and you take away his toys, but still give tge good children toys, what happens? The ""good"" kids give the bad kid the toy on the low. It's not enough to do background checks, because it just doesn't mean anything anymore. 

Our society has dropped in the level of common sense, intelligence, and overall respect for others in the last 23 years since the Columbine massacre. The population, even if there are good people, just are not mentally capable of handling guns. If you aren't active in law enforcement, or military, you shouldn't own a gun. Period. 

""That means the bad people have guns.""

Not if our government, just for a second, acts like an actual goverment and use their resources to strip people of them. Now nobody has a gun. If someone breaks into your home, grab a knife. Is losing your gun such a big deal that you'd be okay with hundreds being murdered in a single month? The supermarket in buffalo, the shooting in Texas public school, the two subway shootings in NYC, and plenty more. 

The answer is ridiculously obvious. There's no way no one hasn't thought of it. You don't prevent a mass shooting by oh so carefully giving out the things that cause them. It's like trying to stop cancer by dousing the body in lethal doses of radiation, but only in one spot. The cancer spresds. Now there are billions of them and you can't keep track. Guess who just got a gun? A mass murdering psycho who shot up a school full of kids. Kids are dying because nobody wants to give up weapons that the modern general public are too stupid, irresponsible, or DERANGED, to handle safely. What a world. 

If you got rid of guns from the general public, you'd eliminate about 70% of gang related violence. 100% of armed robbery. You'd eliminate all excuse of police officers who shot some poor sap because ""they were reaching for a gun."" And you'd eliminate school shootings. Unless the motherf**ker brings a crossbow. 

Now, me, I don't really care. This world can do whatever tickles its fancy. But, don't sit here questioning what you can do if there's always the option to go nuclear. 


*NOT THE MAIN FOCUS, JUST AN [EXTREME] EXAMPLE OF HOW IT COULD BE DONE THOROUGHLY. DON'T ACT AS IF THIS IS MY MAIN FOCUS...MF* 

-Deploy the military within the USA and get guns off the streets. For those of you who don't know, if the military is deployed in the US, anyone who disobeys a direct order IS the enemy. If they were deployed in June, by the end of June, there will be no more guns. The FBI can take care of any websites or gunshops and, it sucks that they'll be out of business, but- that's how far you have to go if you truly want to negate gun violence. If not, stop asking for solutions. They'll all do the same thing: slow it down and then we'll relax and then we'll get more Columbines.



Edit:  (this edit is also in the comments, but i'm not sure if it'd be buried.)  There was an active military person who commented on the post.

And a few others I really wanted to engage with. But, I don't see their comments, reddit's being weird for me. I see a lot of people going on about the military example I gave, and not really the central point of the post which is that our society just isn't capable of coexisting with guns, and that it'd be much better to just take them from the hands of the general public with a thorough cleaning rather than trying to control them through law (since it obviously isn't working...) The method wasn't my main focus. What I proposed was kind of an extreme example of how it could be done with ZERO chance of missing a single civilian firearm, but the central point isn't HOW it gets done, just the fact that to negate gun violence it would be the only thing that would actually do it. Nevermind the method of achieving it. The central point also focused on the fact that people aren't willing to accept the idea that it's the only way (I swear some of you skimmed this sh*t)  and so we'd never truly be rid of it. The method of doing so was never important to the post. Just the solution itself.",2022-06-09T19:51:11+00:00

A would say a small fee of around $10 per transaction would be good. That one is unpopular with firearm owners. 

2) Owners of restricted firearms (hand guns and other guns that have been deemed too scary looking for some people) should be able to use their firearms like unrestricted firearms. ie) they should be able to transport them places other than just a range or for service and should not have to notify the RCMP when they are moving etc. I think that if I were to go get a restricted firearms licence, I should be able to take a handgun with me bow hunting for elk, or backcountry fishing, for bear protection.

It is not unpopular in this sub. This is a gun control subreddit.

If you've been voting for gun control, 90%+ of those votes were for politicians that believed in strengthening the social safety net, improving healthcare, improving schools, offering secondary education, reducing income inequality, increasing public safety, and offering services to fill needed gaps in public health and safety.

If you've been a single issue voter for guns, you've unequivocally voted for politicians that massively defunded and dismantled all those areas. Same politicians that massively increased income inequality and have dismantled the social safety net over the last 43+ years. Not a year goes by the federal budget those are the areas that they fight to cut funding for. If 50+ people are shot, these same politicians will point the finger at healthcare/mental health as the issue... then immediately vote against it. Even when it would help their districts, they vote against it. Their lips say one thing, but their actions say a much different thing.

**It's the same exact thing when talking to pro gun people. Spent their entire life voting for politicians that are against healthcare/mental health/social programs... while blaming the lack of all of the above.** It's a distraction from regulating firearms, as they don't intend to actually fix any of these areas.

That's why there needs to be insurance. So the victims can be compensated. After that, you would be surprised at the assets a good accountant can find, starting with your gun collection.

> 4) ""to feel safe"". 

The 70% of the population who don't own guns need to feel safe from the 30% who do own guns. If gun-owners can't devise means to ensure the rest of the population that they are safe from them, that rest of the population will. That's what gun-control efforts are all about. If all you do is fight gun-control and you don't participate in solving the problem, you are the problem.

> 5) forcing gun owners to have insurance like car owners will change nothing. 

That's your opinion. IMO, following the model used for automobiles--involving training, testing, licensing, registration, inspection, iinsurance, and monitoring by law enforcement--would reduce gun deaths from accidents, assaults, and possibly even suicides. It would be greatly authoritarian and possible overkill, but 70% of the population would feel safer and you would still get to own guns. Fight it and all other gun-control measures that are proposed and you may lose everything.

guncontrol,post,Deductibles,73ui8x,wolfgeist,Coincidence?,"Now first off let me say that I've been shooting for 30 years. My memories of driving up into the mountains and plinking with my grandpa are literally my favorite memories. I convinced him to buy me an AR-15 in the 90's largely due to the surging popularity of them and it was becoming increasingly acceptable in the shooting/ hunting community to own them (I remember back when it was generally frowned upon to want to own  magazine fed semi autos in common military calibers within the hunting community as it was generally thought they made gun owners look bad). 

I am not anti gun,  I believe that in the U.S. people should be able to have access to firearms capable for self defense,  hunting, and sport shooting. 

 
AFAIK, the top 3 mass shootings (in terms of fatalities) committed by single shooters are Oslo, Orlando,  and now Vegas. 

Next down on the list is Virginia Tech at least in the U.S.

 Is there a common theme among these top 3 massacres? Yes,  there is. Magazine fed semi automatic rifles in common military calibers. 

Jumping down on the list is the Virginia Tech shooting which was committed with semi auto pistols. 

Speaking in strictly data driven terms perhaps we can't say that higher casualties are correlated with magazine fed semi auto rifles,  but it doesn't take a grand deduction in logic to understand that decreased time between shots fired and between reloads = more potential carnage. 


My question is would laws restricting the proliferation and access to these weapons reduce the fatality cap in mass shootings over time (I'm talking long term here,  decades upon decades would be needed for the laws to take effect).

The problem is we can never really know or if we can know, it's difficult to convince others. How many lives have gun control laws saved? If this shooting was committed with a fully automatic weapon and if the death toll is a  indication of the power of such weapons compared to semi automatic rifles, we can only wonder how many lives have been saved by the NFA restriction laws over the course of history. 

Gun rights advocates love to say that limiting access to guns is never a deterrent, and that if a potential criminal wants a weapon, the law won't stop them.  We've all read about the terrorist stabbings in Europe,  can we honestly say that those terrorists simply didn't want a fully automatic weapon and that their knife attacks are just as deadly as a similar attack with a fully automatic weapon? I believe it takes a significant level of intellectual dishonesty to espouse such nonsense.

If these are the only kind of guns in society I'd probably okay with it. There's no way these kind of guns could fire at 700 rpm. This is the whole point, the 2nd amendment was made during times of muskets and cannons. From 2 angles the 2nd amendment is completely outdated, in the sense that the army is no longer about 40 000 men with muskets and cannon, that a population of millions can easily defeat, and the weapons on both sides have advanced so dramatically ordinary citizens shouldn't be able to get them with such ease. 

> I find it hard to support anyone saying they care about prison reform, privacy over security, police reform, fairness and justice when they have no problem trampling over my 2nd amendment protections. 

This makes no sense whatsoever. I have no idea how you managed to link these issues. All of these, including the 2nd amendment, need reform. If you're looking for a single word to bind all of these together, it's social justice. There's no social justice when dozens of people die needlessly from gun violence. There's no social justice when prison profit off of human lives. There's no social justice when privacy is compromised for security, there's no social justice when police can practically murder people and get away with it, etc. 

> If you're willing to sell the 2nd down the river, how do I know you won't sell the 4th or 5th as well?

Slipperslope much? Because there are issues specifically with the 2nd amendment, and my arguments are for the 2nd amendment.

I see what you are saying. I guess I'm more frustrated with the laws. Like if there were a law to prevent people from getting hit by lightning or a law that would substantially reduce lightning strikes I would also be all for that. Why wouldn't anyone want that you know? Common sense. I know I get paralyzed by fear. Something like lightning or a car accident are just that, accidents. It's much more frustrating when it's some person with access to lethality blowing holes through innocent children for no reason other than he's mad. Again, not directing anything at anyone, just so much frustration. Then you have some politician on Fox News days after the tragedies showing off his guns saying he can do whatever he wants with his guns. Like, these are the idiots making decisions? How does this even get to this point ya know?

I get the odds are extremely low, but I feel they should be zero or close to zero. Take Japan, which does permit guns after a VERY extensive background check that lasts nearly a year or longer. Multiple interviews with family, psychological evaluations, proper arms training. MORE evaluation. If you want a gun in Japan you have to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you are sane enough and careful enough to own something of that magnitute. I get the country was disarmed after WWII, and that set them up to start with no guns or very little guns with their gun policies, but a federal buy back program would reduce the amount of them. Keeping your guns would require you to take and pass training programs and psychological evaluations. This would not be perfect, I get that, but let's at least start. As time went on, guns would become something akin to getting a passport or a driver's license, but on a much more monumentally difficult scale. Spitballing here.

Example, a storm is coming, get inside to safety. Drive safely and watch your surroundings to reduce your chance of a car wreck. These situations give someone a sense of control. Unlike, going to the grocery store to pick up some spaghetti ingredients and shots are fired and people start dropping dead, or sending your kid to a PLACE OF LEARNING and they never come home, and are for the most part, totally unrecognizable. Just like that. No warning, your life is totally and completely changed forever.

The preparedness for gun violence is literally ""Just hope it doesn't happen to you, your family, your children, your co-workers."" There's very very little one can do as a preventative measure.

No laws. Neck beards preventing anything from happening over an amendment that was written when someone could maybe, possibly get off three shots a MINUTE if they were extremely skilled. This damn law needs to scale with the access. If I could just go build a nuke in my driveway would I be permitted to own at as an ""arm."" No. That's ridiculous. I feel that when the second amendment was drawn up, if high powered rapidly firing guns were something an 18 year old could just go purchase, they would have worded it a lot differently.

No good, decent, fast response is ever going to happen. Just more thoughts and prayers.

Also, my cousin was shot by a gun when he was 7. Thought it was a water gun and got hot and really thirsty riding his bike. My aunt worked at a convenience store and kept it with her behind the counter due to the nature of her job. It was in her glove box while she was inside visiting her sister (his mom). If she wasn't afraid of someone owning a gun and shooting her, she wouldn't have owned that gun that accidentally (and nearly) killed my cousin. They were able to save him after five surgeries. These things being around are just so asinine to me it's beyond comprehension. You want to hunt? Go string up a bow and arrow or prove to this country you are trustable with your gun. She made a terrible decision with her gun that day, and honestly she should have never owned it or felt the need to own it in the first place.

Like I'm five, WHY won't these poiliticians do anything? Is it really their damn NRA reelection money? That's a whole other issue I can't even wrap my head around.",2022-06-09T19:14:43+00:00

Comparing us to any other country just isn't going to work because of the constitution and bill of rights. I totally agree if you deleted guns off the face of the country people wouldn't die of guns but its just not going to happen that way in this country. 

(This paragraph is gonna be pretty graphic) Everyone focuses on the size of the mags or the rate of fire when in reality if you examine how these shootings happen there executing people stuck in locked rooms. It's terrifying but if you gave them break action sporting shotguns or single shot pistols they would still be effective. It only takes one round.

Now I'm sorry to hear about your cousin's situation. However according to federal laws already on the books, your aunt is already a felon for storing a firearm in that manor. However it isn't enforced in most situations. Storing a loaded firearm accessible to a minor is already a felony. Laws can only do so much. 

Also I disagree that we can't have fast response. Personally I'm pro resource officer. There are anecdotal cases of resource officers stoping shootings at schools or in the vecinity of schools. I think it also isn't a waste of resources as it is a community building opportunity for youth to interact and have relationships with police officers prior to an altercation in the streets. I think it could help alot especially in inner cities ect. 

Depending on the year 1000 children die in car accidents a year, there are already laws on the books for driver safety and vehicle safety but we haven't eliminated them either.

* require that people have a license to drive
* keep track of who owns all cars with license plates in the case that your car is used in a crime or stolen
* prevent people for whom it is not safe to drive from driving (people who have seizures, the very elderly, etc.)
* require that people who own a car have insurance to pay for if their car damages someone else's property or harms their health

What's so different about guns that we shouldn't do the exact same thing for guns?

Granted, there are some conservatives who will say that we should loosen all those regulations on cars, and I'll give them credit for being consistent, but if someone thinks those regulations for cars are reasonable, shouldn't the same regulations for guns seem reasonable?

guncontrol,comment,Health insurance marketplace,cvyug96,southernbenz,,"Pro-control ""gunner"" here.  

We agree on *all* points.  We do need classes, we do need 4473's (BATFE form to track ownership), we do need ownership restrictions (medical, minimum age, etc).  The one difference is, many gun owners feel it's not the government's place to impose educational ""classes"" for gun ownership/carry.  Gun owners feel the US Government either looks at you as an adult or a child, and they either trust you or they don't trust you.  Owners believe gun classes are/can/will-be akin to Jim Crowe-esque voting restrictions (literacy tests, etc) and we already fought the battle to have constitutional rights free of Government-imposed ""tests"" and ""requirements"" 100 years ago.

So, on one hand I understand that argument.  Having your government give you a ""test"" you must pass in order to exercise a constitutional right is rather Jim Crowe-esque.  On the other hand, some people shouldn't ever be within one mile of a firearm.  So, we need background checks (better background checks than we have right now) and people *should* pass some knowledge/practical test.  The general consensus among the gun community (at the moment) is the background check (NICS) should be more comprehensive and any knowledge/practical test should be imposed by FFL's (federally licensed gun dealers).  

Now, FFL's already must abide by many federal requirements (ie, 4473).  If FFL's instituted their own training/practical requirements for firearm purchase, this would be highly accepted among the ""gunner"" community. ",2015-10-14T00:44:26+00:00

There's no need for one because there's no evidence of states behaving as recklessly with driver's licenses as they do with guns.  I'm pretty sure there's no state that is pushing for removing license requirements for drivers altogether.  On the gun side we already have states where concealed carry doesn't require a permit or a license.  The fact is that many states have demonstrated a willful disregard for gun control laws and have proven that they can't be trusted to manage it on their own.

I can understand their feelings, but really, what alternative is there?  Our government is democratic in nature.  Officials are elected, and their actions are subject to scrutiny that far exceeds what any private company executives or employees face.  If an individual has a specific problem with a government agency or its lack of transparency, there is a system in place whereby they can have their grievance addressed.  Finally, ""feelings"" alone can't be a justification for policy.

> Owners believe gun classes are/can/will-be akin to Jim Crowe-esque voting restrictions

But this belief is false.  The JC restrictions were purposely set about in a way to disenfranchise a targeted group based on their race.  Furthermore, restricting someone's right to vote isn't the same as restricting someone's right to own a dangerous weapon.  In a constitutional republic like ours, the real power of the people is in their vote.  Denying a vote is denying democracy.  I know that gun owners want to make the case that guns are required for Democracy as well, but there are dozens of modern industrialized democracies that don't have gun rights, so their point is without merit.

But it would also be wildly inconsistent, and ironically, would probably lead to the kind of Jim Crow system you're arguing against.  An FFL is accountable to nobody except the bottom line.  If they deny a sale it can mean denying $thousands in revenue to themselves.  The conflict of interest is too great.  Furthermore, we already have FFLs in places like Florida who make public statements where they deny 'Muslims' the right to even enter their store.

> i have a carry permit. and on the permit, why can't i carry in all 50 states wit it? i can drive in all 50 states.

Because the requirements for a carry permit vary from state to state, whereas a drivers license is fairly standardized across the country. If you have a drivers license from Utah, it's safe to say you know the driving laws of New York because they're basically the same. On the other hand, you can get a carry permit in Utah for the cost of a stamp and a short online training course that in no way meets the requirements for carrying a gun in New York. Therefore you should not be allowed to carry a gun in New York. 

A truck has a useful, peaceful purpose. What purpose does an automatic weapon have? Why do you need a suppressor if you're a law abiding gun owner? Get ear plugs. Your arguments are ludicrous.  Are you buying guns to sport shoot or to take on the army? Why do you need laser sights and flashlights and pistol grips to shoot at paper targets? Why do you need a barrel shroud unless you're hiding in the brush sniping at people? These are not ""arbitrary cosmetic features,"" they're tactical enhancements designed to make a gun more deadly. That's *why* they were developed, that's *why* the military uses them, and that's *why* they need to be prohibited from civilian use. 

Exactly what kind of moron are you that you think that firearms education should be conducted in schools? The insurance alone would bankrupt any public school district in the country, nevermind the cost of the first lawsuit brought by the family of the kid ""accidentally"" shot in firearms ed class.

Owning a gun is a privilege as well, unless you're a part of a well regulated militia. I know you think the first four words don't count, but they wouldn't be there if they didn't mean something.

guncontrol,comment,Health insurance marketplace,cvzjr0s,aiurlives,,"All your points are right on.  I'd also add that there are multiple Federal standards for automobiles that govern their safety features and construction.  Car manufacturers have to prove they've met these standards by subjecting their vehicles to crash testing.  When safety flaws are uncovered, the Federal government places a heavy burden on the manufacturers requiring that they inform the owners of the problem and repair it at the manufacturer's cost.

When a manufacturing defect with a gun happens, no Federal agency is involved and normally a class has to be formed and the manufacturer sued in court.  These cases rarely result in the gun manufacturer admitting any wrongdoing.  For instance, in this case involving Remington and an allegedly defective trigger mechanism, Remington agreed to replace these triggers but can actually still legally sell these rifle models.  he Fed's hands are basically tied thanks to a specific carve out in consumer law which forbids the Fed from ordering gun manufacturers to recall defective products.

guncontrol,post,healthcare costs,28yrsm,stefanevada1,Active Shooter Events and American Health Care,"In order to maintain a little bit of OPSEC (operational security) I'll just say I'm a military police officer (hopefully granting me a little bit of credibility on the issue I'll discuss here). 

The FBI did a case study on active shooter events and in every single event cited the perpetrator was either too young to truly understand what he or she was doing (13 years [this is a very loose definition of young] or younger) or they were mentally deranged or had major mental health issues. Case studies for that would be the Sandy Hook Elementary [Newtown] shooting (the shooter, Adam Lanza, had aspergers), Columbine (shooters were both heavily medicated: ""In one of his scheduled meetings with his psychiatrist, Eric Harris complained of depression, anger and possessing suicidal thoughts. As a result, he was prescribed the anti-depressant Zoloft. He complained of feeling restless and having trouble concentrating; in April, his doctor switched him to Luvox, a similar anti-depressant drug. At the time of his death, Harris had therapeutic Luvox levels in his system. Some analysts, such as psychiatrist Peter Breggin, have argued that one or both of these medications may have contributed to Harris's actions. Breggin said that side-effects of these drugs include increased aggression, loss of remorse, depersonalization, and mania.""), etc. 

An interesting case to then look at is the case in Norway where Breivik was able to kill over 60 people utilizing explosives and firearms who was also declared insane. The point in bringing up Norway is that Norway has had one active shooter incident in the past decade and a half, where as the United States has one almost, if not, monthly. Canada, our neighbor to the north, has virtually none as well with close proximity and relaxed border searches with the United States where 90% of the Canadian population lives within less than a days drive to the border. 

So what's the point? The point is that active shooter events are a high frequency event in the US where the perpetrators are mentally deranged. In other developed nations; Germany, France, England, Norway, Finland, etc. active shooter events rarely, if ever, happen at all where access to firearms granted is restricted, but not completely impossible to obtain (every Swiss male owns a government issued weapon). The glaring difference here is health care. The United States, with its outrageous health care costs make it extremely difficult or unattainable for individuals that desperately need it. Granted some people did try to receive treatment such as the Columbine shooters but many of them had no access to sustainable health care. 

In an awkward causation causality, if you want to stop random acts of violence with firearms that mow down the innocent, a ""good"" base to undermine would be those lacking health care. 

The reason I posed this on this thread is in a perfect world where that happened and I'm right, the focus of gun control laws could be more honed in on individuals using them for crime as opposed to expressions of deranged rage. 

TL;DR: Providing cheap/free healthcare for Americans could reduce active shooter incidents.

**As long as someone keeps their guns on their private property, it is a private matter and they need do nothing to be in compliance with the law. Once they want to take a weapon into the public space, it becomes a public matter and they need to acquire a Firearms Public Carry Permit**, good in all 50 states. That's the second New Idea - private versus public gun rights. On private property, no gun rights are infringed. In the public space, it is a public matter where We The People have a say.

Read the details here:

**Gun Owners For Responsible Gun Control**
https://www.facebook.com/Gun-Owners-for-Responsible-Gun-Control-388371624581877/
 
**OUR PROPOSAL**

If gun owners don’t take the initiative and offer a plan to better regulate firearms, someone else will do it for us. After much thought and discussion, we see that **treating a weapon like a car is a practical and sensible solution** to reduce the horrific gun violence that is dominating the national conversation. Cars, like guns, can be owned and operated responsibly or they can kill and maim. Our proposal offers benefits and protections for gun owners as well as common sense regulations.

So, we propose:

1. People that operate (use or carry it in public), or want to purchase a gun should be required to apply for a permit;

2. Take a written exam that would make the person aware of local liability laws, safe operating procedures, no-gun zones and a situational quiz on Shoot/Don’t Shoot;

3. Pass a proficiency and safety exam at a shooting range. You should be able to hit a target repeatedly and reasonably accurate for the sake of bystanders and folks downrange.

4. Gun owners should be required to purchase liability insurance for any weapon they intend to take out in public. There should be lower cost liability insurance policies for guns that will never leave private property, such as a hunting rifle. Insurance PROTECTS the gun owner if their weapon is stolen and used in a crime or murder. Also, even in a “good shooting” where, for example, the deceased trouble maker’s family is suing the gun owner. The training, permit and insurance will help protect from their lawyer’s attempts to depict the gun owner as untrained or irresponsible. This is huge.

5. Your gun, taken into public, MAY be subject to a safety inspection by a law enforcement officer if there is some indication that it may be old, modified or unsafe. Issues could include bump stocks or loading P+ (extra powerful) ammunition into guns not rated for P+.

For example, if you have a car sitting in your driveway that may not be legally registered or insured, in most municipalities no one will give you a ticket and certainly not confiscate the car as long as it doesn't leave your house. The key is that you cannot OPERATE it without proper registration and insurance or you will be subjected to fines, jail and possible impoundment depending on the severity of the offense. And, like a car, taking it off your property is ""operating"" it. Do you own a ranch or spread out in the country? You can do as you please on your property as long as it does not violate existing BATF restrictions.

6. So, current gun owners may legally leave their stockpiles of currently-legal weapons right where they are and do nothing more. We have no problem with hunters, ranchers, farmers, gun collectors or hobbyists. There will be no door-to-door gun confiscations. But the minute someone wants to pocket a snubbie or sling an AR over their shoulder in public, concealed or open-carry, they subject themselves to a probable-cause police search and validation of the weapon's registration and insurance. Gun ranges would be required to check and report any person that tries to bring an unregistered or uninsured firearm to the range or risk losing their range license and being liable for any problems that occur.

Just like a car. You cannot drive an unlicensed vehicle at the local drag strip's Saturday grudge match and street rod race.

7. If you own ten guns that you want to carry in public, you pay liability insurance on each of them. There might be a distinction between sidearms and long arms, that would be up to the insurance company actuaries.

Just like a car. Ten cars, ten insurance policies. It costs more to insure a tractor-trailer than a VW Bug.

8. You would be subject to restrictions on where you can carry gun. You can't drive your car on the sidewalk or across the city park and you won't be able to take a pistol to a bar or to businesses, government buildings or organizations that post a No Guns Allowed sign on their door. This would apply to open carry or concealed carry. Business owners have their rights, too.

9. Local jurisdictions may allow or deny the Open Carry of weapons. In our view, Open Carry is provocative and unnecessary except in some rural or ranch settings. Besides, you are making yourself a target for armed gun thieves. It has happened.

10. Every person seeking a permit or Concealed Carry Weapons permit would be subjected to a background check through a much-improved system set up and monitored by the FBI. If you have a record of past offenses, you may not qualify to operate a weapon. If you have a restraining order against you or if you are under expulsion order from your high school or a set of other obvious red flags, you would not qualify to purchase or operate a weapon. High schools, mental hospitals and clinics, VA hospitals, social media monitors, the Armed Prohibited Persons System, abuse hotlines and public service TIPS lines would feedback to a central red-flag database which could cause a delay in acquiring a weapon until such concerns are investigated and ruled on.

11. So-called “assault rifles” like the AR-15 and any number of high-performance military-style semiautomatic weapons would be classified as “Title II” weapons as defined by the NFA (National Firearms Act). just like the sawed-off shotgun and short-barreled rifles or silencers. You could keep them at home or on your private land safely and securely but not take them out in public. Hunting rifles and shotguns would usually not be affected except in the case of so-called “street sweepers” and other military-styled semi-automatic weapons. (Any violation of the NFA is a felony punishable by a fine of up to $250,000 and up to 10 years in prison, [4]and any firearm involved is forfeited). 

**A calculation can be devised that computes a weapon's muzzle velocity times bullet weight times the number of rounds per minute it can reasonably fire with a moderately proficient shooter, less reloading time based on a maximum 10-round magazine under average meteorological conditions, etc. to arrive at a number that measures a weapon's Probable Average Throw Weight**, like they measure ballistic missiles. In essence, how much lead a gun can throw and at how many foot-pounds of energy, in one minute.

Weapons with the highest rates of fire, largest caliber and most powerful ammunition and largest magazines would rank the highest. With those numbers for all weapons, it should be a matter of mathematics to decide which weapons should be Title 2 classified. Certainly, the AR-15, the Mini-14 and other obvious guns would go in there but the Throw Weight calculation would rule other guns in or out, eliminating any gray area.

You cannot take a modified stock car onto the streets or a NASCAR machine, either. So again, this is treating guns just like cars.

12. Under these conditions, a gun permit would be deemed valid in all 50 states, just like a driver license. Again, treating the operating of guns like operating cars. 13. The “Gun Trust loophole” that allows people to buy machine guns and short-barreled shotguns and rifles without using a federally licensed Class 3 dealer should be CLOSED. A gun trust is a legal instrument that allows the trust to buy and own guns allowing guns, including AR-15s and machine guns to be handed down to future generations of a family, “insulated” from all those pesky transfers. 14. The “Gun Show Loophole” should be closed and there should be real enforcement against cash and carry no-questions-asked gun sales off the tailgates of trucks in the parking lots of gun shows.

**SUMMARY**

The Second Amendment talks about ""well-regulated"" militias and the right to keep and bear arms. But it does not specify where you can or cannot keep or bear them. Part of well-regulating is this: we WILL specify the who, what, where, when and why of keeping and bearing a firearm. The home is a man's castle, so would typically be sacrosanct but it is that ""operating"" part that the rest of us get to have a say in. When you take your gun off your property, your gun becomes our concern.

We intend to keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn’t have them while protecting responsible gun owner’s right to gun ownership and use and safe from liability in the event of accidental shootings.
So, there is the recipe. Not everyone will be happy with it. The old saw that more guns will make us safer is being disproven every day across America and it is time to do something pragmatic about it. The time has passed for a well-financed and well-organized minority to tell the majority what we are, and are not, going to do and whether we will continue to live our days in fear of the next news report or text message from our kids' school.

Treat guns like cars. Just... like cars.

**OUR POSITION ON GUN BANS**

We generally do not support Gun bans because they would not work. Indeed, they would provoke resistance to the point of civil unrest. That horse has left the barn. Banning assault weapons would also likely fall into that same category. Banning the sale and manufacture of “assault-style weapons” for the civilian market could work.

We do not support gun confiscations for the same reason, except in conjunction with the commission of a felony or violent misdemeanor.

We do not support restrictions of the ownership and use of guns in a purely private setting like your home, ranch or rented hunting land although we DO advocate for legal punishments for accidents or crimes committed by unsecured firearms whether in public or on private property. There should be no “safety-free” zones. 

We are pro-hunting, 

We are pro-self-defense, pro-sport shooting (trap, target, etc.), pro hobbyists and collectors. 

We are TOUGH on crime, straw purchases, illegal guns and criminals with weapons. Homemade guns is a new area that needs more thought. 
 
We believe that it is disgraceful that the USA has no formal laws against exporting guns to gun runners in Central and South America. This is a $20M a year industry for American gun makers.

We want to keep the wrong types of guns off our streets, keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn’t have them, keep everyone as safe as possible and FREE from liability. 

We want to see more gun owners trained, proficient and knowledgeable of local gun ordinances and Shoot/Don’t Shoot situational awareness. 

We don’t want to hear of another kid being shot by their parent as they sneak in through their bedroom window, coming home from a secret late-night party. 

We want gun owners more proficient so that if they DO have to use their weapon in self-defense they are more likely to hit what they intend to and not what they don’t.

We believe this proposal is good for America, good for gun owners and good for non-gun owners. We can do this.

**ON MENTAL ILLNESS**

We do need to better fund all aspects of Health, not least Mental Health. But to skew the conversation away from gun control to an easy, soft target like folks with mental problems is simply shirking the responsibility we all have to come up with real answers.

Most folks with some sort of mental issue (and that would probably include a good half of Americans) are not a problem at all. Let's not use them as a punching bag.

**ON TEACHERS BEING ARMED**

For Donald Trump to make a statement like ""An armed teacher would have shot the hell out of that gunman"" is a strong indication of how willing he is to jump up and boldly go where he has no life experience, no facts and no evidence.

There was an ARMED COP right outside the door when the Florida massacre took place. Now, I can only guess what was going through his mind but I'm pretty sure he was paralyzed with fear. That is something that Trump wouldn't know anything about. It is a real fact in combat and among police officers that sometimes the Good Guy With A Gun is frozen by the banging of high-velocity rounds just around the corner. Their wives and children flash before their eyes, they see themselves being blasted to hell, they hear the tortured screams of those who don't have a choice which side of the wall to stay on. They just simply cannot move their bodies. And, it happens even to seasoned combat vets. Every gunfight is different.

Expecting a school teacher to somehow rise above such an extreme experience, to master their own paralysis, to overcome the near total loss of fine motor functions needed to load, chamber, unSafe and fire a weapon accurately is just pure nonsense. It is a huge Maybe and not something to bet our kids' lives on.
Let's stop grasping at that straw and move on. The teachers, by and large, don't want guns, the kids don't want the teachers to have guns and certainly, responsible gun owners with any high-stress, real-world experience in actual gunfights or battle don't want teachers being charged with making those kinds of decisions where even a trained, armed and prepared cop might falter. This is a diversion from the real issue of gun control. It is a crumb thrown down to divert people who are hungry for change.

**ON THE NRA** 

After first criticizing centrist Americans alarmed at gun violence for ""exploiting a tragedy for political gain"", NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre warned about the potential of another Democratic takeover of the House, Senate and White House.

""If they seize power ... our American freedoms could be lost and our country will be changed forever,"" he said. ""The first to go will be the Second Amendment.""

He further characterized this latest incident as the fault of a ""failure of school security"". I wasn't aware that schools were supposed to resist armed attack.

This kind of alarmist, oogah-boogah from the far right is not helpful. Indeed, it is as divisive as it gets. One would hope that the NRA could state its positions calmly without resorting to hysteria and demonizing the victims of these horrors.

It is worth noting that, while proclaiming that a Gun In Every Hand is the solution to almost all gun-related problems and that the only solution to a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun, the NRA prohibits guns from its meetings and conferences. Now, why on earth would they do that?

**ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT**

There has been a debate over the real meaning and intent of the Second Amendment, especially as regards whether the framers intended it as a Right for every person to bear arms or if it was just intended to a well-regulated militia to have guns.

Even if you accept that gun ownership in America is a Right, not a Privilege, you must answer another question: how is it working? You'd have to be the most myopic, stiff-necked and bull-headed hard right Gun Freak or a Russian Troll to say that guns are working out well for America. We've got problems.

Either we amend the Constitution again, a deeply serious thing that should never be considered without decades or generations of contemplation, or we regulate the presumed Right so that many aspects beyond basic gun ownership are indeed Privileges.

So, let's assume a core Right to keep and bear arms. And it is only reasonable to update their declaration, based on cap and ball pistols and breach loading single-shot muskets and rifles to their modern day equivalents, basic handguns and long arms.

The Constitution does not extend your right to keep and bear arms to also include 30-round magazines and semi-automatic receivers with bump stocks. It does not protect armor-piercing ammunition, tracers and fully automatic machine guns. Those are all things that the State has every right and responsibility to regulate, outlaw or abridge.

A man's home has always been viewed as his castle and he is generally free to do whatever he wants there as long as it is not injurious or dangerous. So, guns can be viewed as being in the category of things a person can generally do as they see fit - on their own property. But those home rights end at your sidewalk.

The Constitution does not say that an individual can bear arms in public spaces. It just doesn't. It does not say you can openly carry and display arms, even when it distresses or disrupts the other citizens.

The Constitution does not declare that the gun rights of one person can be permitted to overrule other peoples' rights to peace, security and their pursuit of happiness? If public spaces are inherently shared spaces, aren't personal liberties abridged if they go against the desires of the majority, at least in the realm of security and fear? You can't walk through Grand Central Station with a lion on a leash or get on an elevator with a King Cobra on your arm.

In the public space, We The People, through our elected representatives have every right to control what occurs, to include gun possession, acquisition and use.

**ON THE REALITY OF KILLING A MAN**

For those of you who have never killed a man, fired a gun in self-defense or been caught up in a gunfight, it is a terrifying and agonizing experience that can haunt you for years. To find out what it is like and why people end up losing their homes, marriages, money and jobs after a ""good and justified shooting"" we highly recommend this book: **In the Gravest Extreme: The Role of the Firearm in Personal Protection**. By former cop and firearms expert, Masaad F. Ayoub

**WHAT YOU CAN DO**

If Facebook pages are any indication, Americans are angry about this situation and asking what to do about it.

Contact your elected representatives. You are Constitutionally guaranteed the right to petition the government. This is the most direct and simple way to do so. Also, sign petitions on WhiteHouse.gov. Those make their way to the President.

Also, as the Spring weather warms, there will be citizens gathering in public demonstrations, demanding politicians take action. Do not hesitate to join one of your local ""protests"". You will find yourself in the company of both political parties as well as teachers that are directly in the line of fire, school district administrators at wit's end, off-duty police who have to root out these killers, medical personnel who have to try and save the shattered victims, parents, clergy and otherwise plain, ordinary citizens who just think the Gun Glut is madness. Google your city's name and ""Gun Protests"" for a listing of planned events.
It is an invigorating and constructive experience and does, indeed, is a powerful way for each of us to ""do something"". Maybe I'll see you there on the front lines of a growing grassroots movement that is starting to apply real pressure on Washington.

Also, if you like Gun Owner's For Responsible Gun Control's proposal, please feel free to re-post, email or otherwise promote it. That is how ""viral"" events occur and the ground is fertile for a sensible, centrist plan to sharply reduce the chaos and murder.

Stand. Make your voices heard. Do it for the kids, if nothing else.

Here is where you get Contact information for your elected representatives:

guncontrol,comment,unnecessary tests,dvrfr58,Kent-In-KC,,"Taking a gun to the range would constitute taking it into public, so you would need a Firearms License for that. To take an AR-15 to the range would require a Title 2 permit from the BATF.

By private property, we envision literally your house, your yard, your farm, your ranch, your 40 acres of hunting and fishing paradise in Colorado. If you own the ground you can have your gun there, no permitting required.

The net effect would be that most gun owners would acquire the Firearms License to carry a Title 1 concealed weapon like a .40 semi-auto pistol or a .357 revolver. They could also take a Title 1 weapon to the range or hunting. A Title 1 might be a Winchester 300 hunting rifle, a bolt-action 30-30 or a semi-automatic 9MM carbine. Most guns would still be classified as Title 1. Only the most powerful weapons with high rates of fire would qualify as Title 2.

Title 2 would probably include any variant of the AR-15 or AK-47, except a .22 caliber. It all depends on the math calculation that determines how much bullet weight the gun can throw and at what energy level (usually measured in Joules).

That's our proposal, anyway. 

There is a 9mm version of AR-15 that would probably qualify as Title 1 as long as we disallow mods like bump stocks and trigger cranks.

applythrottle • reply
So this means that only guns carried in public would be subject to this. If someone wants to own their AR-15 at home and take it to a range then they don’t need a permit because having the gun locked in a case in the vehicle would be treated the same as having a race car at home that’s not registered for street use and then you load it up on the trailer and take it to the race track, correct?

guncontrol,comment,unnecessary tests,dvwaxwp,Kent-In-KC,,"Lance Logue suggested this. I like it and have added a few things to it (the ALSO: parts). What do you think?

There are things we can do now.
1.	Close the three-day NICS window. As it currently stands if a purchaser does not receive his denial within three days the transfer may be completed. 
2.	Hire more people to work within the NICS.
3.	Change the direction of information in the Firearm Owner Protection Act. As it currently stands a firearms dealer may obtain electronic information that an individual is excluded from firearms purchases, the FBI and BATF do not receive any information in return to indicate what firearms are being purchased. 
4.	Prosecute people under the existing laws. During the first 17 months of the Brady Act only seven persons were convicted, in the first year only 250 cases were referred for prosecution and 217 of these were rejected.
5.	Link databases. In the ATF FTS (Firearms Tracing System) right now has five databases:
A.	Multiple sales reports: registration records of specific firearms and owner name and address.
B.	Suspect Guns: individuals purchasing large quantities of guns, dealers with bad record keeping.
C.	Traced guns: detailed records of all guns and all traces since the inception of the program
D.	Out of business records: records of Form 4473 since 1968.
E.	Theft guns: firearms reported to the ATF as stolen. Contains only thefts from licensed dealers and interstate carriers. DOES NOT have an interface with FBI NCIC theft database, where a majority of stolen, lost and missing firearms are reported. 
6.	Enforce the Lautenberg Amendment fully throughout law enforcement communities and the military.
- ALSO: Require all states to upgrade their forms to one standard form that clearly indicates whether the specific federal criteria apply, making it easy to determine whether the firearms restriction applies without a detailed reading of the order, the petition, and other court records.
- ALSO: Remove the “intimate partner requirement” of the Lautenberg Amendment.
- ALSO: There should be provisions for restricted offenders to get their gun ownership rights restored in either felony or violent misdemeanor cases, subject to standard guidelines including, sentence served, no offenses since that conviction and re-evaluation of the offender by a court-appointed professional. If the subject’s rights are restored, the person that filed the original protection order should be notified.
7.	Make a law, any gun owner who has had firearms owned by them, that have been lost or stolen must report these weapons to the NCIC or face criminal charges. More than 70% of armed career criminals get their guns from “off-the-street sales” and “criminal acts” such as burglaries, and 71% of these firearms are stolen.Tracing these firearms will not lead to the criminals, as the trail stops at the last legal owner.
8.	Do not allow the purchase of armor piercing ammunition to civilians. As of now, it is legal to possess, purchase, sell, and shoot AP rounds. It is illegal to manufacture or import and the restrictions are done by caliber, so you can’t get 9mm AP (primarily handgun round) but 5.56 NATO is exempted through this loophole. Many semi-automatic rifles/sporting rifles (“ARs”) are chambered for 5.56 NATO. 
ALSO: Similarly, “exploding” ammo should be outlawed, including hand loaded rounds that put a primer in the hollow of a hollow-point bullet.",2018-03-18T16:26:56+00:00

So, it would be reasonable to allow the transport of an unlicensed or Title 2 firearm in your private auto if it is secured in a locked case and/or in the trunk or glove box. That would allow you to get it from home to hunting property, etc. Also, it may be reasonable t declare accredited gun ranges as an extension of your private property in the sense that you could bring unlicensed firearms there.

As someone who has been through the process, I can tell you this:  It might as well be issued to anyone who pays the fee.  The classes and tests are a joke (at least in Ky).  It's an 8 hour lecture about when you can and can not justifiably use a firearm along with BASIC safety rules (which are just common sense), and you had to show the instructor that you know how to disassemble your weapon for cleaning.  And I really felt like the instructor was stalling for time to stretch it out to 8 hours.  He told a bunch of stories about training classes he has given to police and stuff like that, which were totally unrelated to the subject material.  He also told a bunch of anecdotal stories about defensive gun use, most of which seemed like hearsay and not actual documented incidents.  It was always something like ""A guy I knew once had to ...""  or ""The brother of an officer I trained got robbed in..."", etc.  Not trying to say anything bad about the instructor, he was really nice and knowledgeable.  It just seemed like he was given 2 hours worth of material and told to teach an 8 hour class is all I'm saying.

The range test was just proving that you could load the weapon, and you had to hit at least 11 out of 20 shots on a silhouette target at 7 yards.  You literally could throw the gun at the target and hit it at least 11 out of 20 times at that range.  The whole thing really felt like ""just going through the motions"".

At least there was a background check conducted by the state police, which took a couple months.  I really have no idea how thorough they are with the background check.  I assume that they just check to make sure you have no convictions, but they may actually dig deeper.  I can't say for sure.

I get the feeling that a lot of other states with similar CCDW processes are very similar to what I went through, but again, that's just speculation.  I'd like to hear from some other CCDW holders from other states to verify that.",2018-03-17T02:24:38+00:00

I think Virginia (?) is one of the more notorious permit mills. You literally just send in a hundred bucks or whatever and they send you a permit. That is also why it is/was not honored by many states, including Missouri. 

But yeah, we do need a realistic training/testing/permitting process that actually establishes that a person has a clue when to shoot/not shoot, how to handle the weapon safely and can hit a target fairly accurately - without making it so difficult that the NRA declares it Infringement. I do think any permitting and exam process should include excerpts from In The Gravest Extreme, so folks can get a hint of what happens when you actually shoot someone, even in a ""good shoot"" and how training and serious cognizance is essential before you entertain arming yourself, not to mention the need for insurance to protect you from the bad guys' family's lawyer.

In any event, all three enjoyed protected person civilian status at the time of their killing.

status. Therefore, they are entitled to be treated as civilians.

&#x200B;

In this post, I will try to highlight some of the war crimes the Israeli special forces might've committed

War Crime 1-Hospital:

Israel’s attack wasn’t only distinct disrespect of the hospital’s sanctity, but brazen disregard for very restrictive prohibitions: not being the object of attack.

>Article 18 – Wounded and - sick III. Protection of hospitals
  
Civilian hospitals organized to give care to the wounded and sick, the infirm and maternity cases, may in no circumstances be the object of attack, but shall at all times be respected and protected by the Parties to the conflict.

&#x200B;

War Crime 2-Extrajudicial Killing:

Two of the Palestinians were said to have been **unarmed and sleeping** at the time of their execution.

>Article 27, Geneva Convention IV provides that protected persons shall be “protected especially against all acts of violence”.

&#x200B;

War Crime 3-Hors de Combat:

This IMO is the worst one, if you want to know how bad it is Sgt Blackman, a Brit marine, was convicted of murdering an Afghan under this crime in 2013. The first Brit since WWII. That level of egregious.

>Article 3 common to all four Conventions (1949): This article, present in each of the four main Geneva Conventions, prohibits violence against persons ""taking no active part in the hostilities,"" including those ""placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause."" While not defining ""hors de combat"" explicitly, it establishes their protected status.

&#x200B;

War Crime 4-Perfidy:

By disguising themselves as seemingly harmless, protected medical personnel and civilians, the Israeli forces also prima facie committed the war crime of perfidy, which is prohibited in all circumstances

>While the act itself doesn't have a specific designation or ban within international law, it falls under the broader category of ""perfidy"" which is prohibited under Article 37(1)(a) of Additional Protocol I. Perfidy involves acts of trickery or deception that violate the good faith expected in armed conflict.

&#x200B;

Additional Violations:

The targeted killing of all three compounds in appreciating additional rights afford them, namely;
  

\- The Right to Life (Article 6 ICCPR which Israel is signatory)
  
\- The Right to Fair Trial (Article 14 ICCPR)
  

Israel deprived all three of both while committing war crimes.

>**The targeted killing of persons suspected of performing terrorist activities is not compatible with the right to life and to a due process**, neither in peacetime nor within the context of armed conflicts, may they be of an international character or of a non-international character. In order to promote the dignity of the person, IHL protects combatants and civilians taking part in hostilities from arbitrary and unlawful deprivation of life. It determines that these persons shall be punished only after adequate judicial procedures, put in place to assess violations of IHL or criminal responsibility, for engaging in hostilities without being entitled to do so, for war crimes, or for common crimes. Moreover, the civilian population in general is also

IsraelPalestine,comment,Affordable Care Act,kpxqzsa,CreativeRealmsMC,,"Now that I am at my PC I can thoroughly debunk your laughable claims.

You start your post by claiming that all three enjoyed ""protected civilian status"" and quoted a big wall of text which is completely irrelevant in order to ""prove"" your point. You tried to imply that the three enjoyed protected status because there was ""doubt as to whether a person is a civilian or a combatant"". Of course this is simple projection. You as a pro-Palestinian naturally doubt they were combatants however the text applies to the group carrying out the attack which is Israel. Israel had no doubts whatsoever that the three were combatants and this was also proven later as all three were publicly claimed by various terror groups in the West Bank as being members.

Strike one for your post.

&#x200B;

> Civilian hospitals organized to give care to the wounded and sick, the infirm and maternity cases, may in no circumstances be **the object of attack** 

Your next claim was that the hospital was the object of attack which it was not but rather the three people who were in it. The implication that combatants can hide in hospitals and be protected from attack would incentivize the use of hospitals to shield combatants defeating their purpose as a protected structure.

Strike two.

Your next claim was that Israel committed the crime of extrajudicial killing. This claim relies on your first claim that the three were ""protected persons"" which they were not.

> Article 27, Geneva Convention IV provides that **protected persons** shall be “protected especially against all acts of violence”. 

Strike three (we'll keep going though).

Your next claim was that all three fell under Hors de Combat. Hors de Combat only applies in the following cases:

(a) anyone who is in the power of an adverse party;

(b) anyone who is defenseless because of unconsciousness, shipwreck, wounds or sickness; or

(c) anyone who clearly expresses an intention to surrender; provided he or she abstains from any hostile act and does not attempt to escape.

As none of them were captured, defenseless, unconscious, shipwrecked, or surrendering the rule does not apply.

Your claim of perfidy does have merit but as other countries have special forces who disguise themselves in order to carry out military operations I have to assume there is some exception to the rule or people only care when Israel does it.

Same goes for the targeted killing of terrorists considering other countries do this as well most notably the US with its killing of Soleimani, Bin Laden, multiple leaders of ISIS, etc.

When Israel does exactly that in an operation that resulted in 0 civilian casualties.

""This is unacceptable, Israel is committing war crimes.""

For the record, I don't necessarily agree with executing the terrorists who were using the hospital as a base for organizing another October 7 style massacre against Israeli civilians instead of detaining and trying them in court. But considering Hamas has repeatedly attempted to use the illegally kidnapped hostages as bargaining chips in exchange for the release of violent criminals, and the fact that October 7th was orchestrated by a prisoner who was released in such an exchange, I understand why Israel would choose execution over detention at this point, even if I don't personally agree with it.",2024-02-11T16:27:55+00:00

3). They are planning an attack, they are actively participating in the fighting 

4). This is not so clear cut.  The Israelis used deception in order to protect the hospital workers and actually innocent patients. Doing this was much safer than attacking the hospital.

IsraelPalestine,comment,Affordable Care Act,kpxi9ey,CreativeRealmsMC,,"Sadly I’m on my phone so I can’t quote IHL directly but I see you are trying to redefine legal terms so you can claim they apply where they do not.

For one the people who were killed were not civilians. Combatants are defined as anyone who is a member of an armed group with the exception of medical or religious personnel.

For the sake of argument however we can pretend that they are civilians. Civilians lose protection from attack when they directly participate in hostilities. Planning a copycat Oct 7th attack falls under direct participation in hostilities.

Hors de combat only applies to people who have been captured by an adversary, people who are defenseless due to injury/shipwrecked, and people who have surrendered. Sleeping does not make someone Hors de combat.

Planning an attack while being in a hospital does not make someone immune from attack. If anything the people planning an attack while in a hospital were violating international law.

The only point I don’t have a perfect answer on is perfidy but Israel isn’t the only country to use special forces who disguise themselves so I have to imagine there are cases in which it is permitted or simply everyone violates it but people only care when Israel does as well.",2024-02-11T14:10:05+00:00

IsraelPalestine,comment,Affordable Care Act,kpybby3,SteelyBacon12,,"There are a couple of foundational assumptions in your analysis that are probably wrong.

First, you assume Hamas members are protected persons as either civilians or combatants under Geneva convention Article 4.  This is not true in a simple way in either the letter of the law or past practice.  Article 4 lays out 6 categories of protected persons, it seems obvious to me that 5 of 6 do not apply.  The one I think you have the best shot of arguing pertains is the second category which deals with ""members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this territory is occupied, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfil the following condition"" and goes on to list 4 conditions enumerated as a-d.

However, Hamas seems to fulfill at best (a) of these 4 conditions (they may have a command structure?), so they seem to be outside the documentary protections of Section 4.  As Section 4 is the only part I have found that deals with protections of militias in the Geneva convention (as far as I can tell without having read all these treaties), then I don't think Hamas is very likely to be protected at all by the document.  Incidentally, an argument like this was what motivated the US to detain people in Guantanamo Bay.  

I should note that analysis is controversial because some NGOs think it creates a human rights black hole, but personally I have no issues with the idea that groups that quite clearly act outside of ""legally acceptable"" mechanisms for participation in armed conflict are not protected by IHL.

The second assumption you make is that Palestine is sufficiently like a State that international humanitarian law applies.  I think that is a deeply uncertain question.  [Here](https://www.ejiltalk.org/does-israel-have-the-right-to-defend-itself/) is a blog post that addresses it somewhat tangentially from a lawyer.  Personally, I tend to think that because Hamas isn't protected in any event this question is of less importance.

Third, you argue that Israel's ""plain clothes"" or para-military group here was illegal.  I think that may actually be true and it would put the people who did the killing outside of Geneva convention protections, rather like spies who can be detained for the crime of espionage, but it is not that unusual.  While I do not know of other instances of people dressing as doctors to execute people in a hospital, I do know the US used genetic data gleaned from polio inoculations to locate bin laden so militarization of purportedly health functionaries does seem to have some antecedents.

Last, you seem to think that people in hospitals are absolutely immune to attack.  This is not true.  Hospitals are no longer protected to the extent they are used to engage in hostilities.  It is possible, that the two probably injured Hamas members shouldn't have been killed. However, the healthy guy issuing orders seems like an obviously acceptable target.",2024-02-11T16:59:49+00:00

*strike one:* 

>You start your post by claiming that all three enjoyed ""protected civilian status"" and quoted a big wall of text which is completely irrelevant in order to ""prove"" your point. You tried to imply that the three enjoyed protected status because there was ""doubt as to whether a person is a civilian or a combatant"". Of course this is simple projection. You as a pro-Palestinian naturally doubt they were combatants however the text applies to the group carrying out the attack which is Israel. Israel had no doubts whatsoever that the three were combatants and this was also proven later as all three were publicly claimed by various terror groups in the West Bank as being members.  
>  
>Strike one for your post.

It seems that you are mistaken about something, a person who is a member of a terror group does not mean he cannot enjoy a ""protected civilian statute"", naturally he will lose that statute but he can regain that statute under certain circumstances, for example during a ceasefire or if there no ongoing active engagement unless you or Israel can provide evidence that the three were engaged in active hostilities against the state of Israel or were an active threat, then you cannot justify killing them, you can arrest them but you can not summarily execute them.

&#x200B;

*strike two:*

>Your next claim was that the hospital was the object of attack which it was not but rather the three people who were in it. The implication that combatants can hide in hospitals and be protected from attack would incentivize the use of hospitals to shield combatants defeating their purpose as a protected structure.  
>  
>Strike two.

Well like the previous point, you have to provide hard evidence that these people were using the hospital as a military base and not using it for its intended usage, even if they were, this will only justify the raid, not the execution.

&#x200B;

*strike three:*

>Your next claim was that Israel committed the crime of extrajudicial killing. This claim relies on your first claim that the three were ""protected persons"" which they were not.  
>  
>Strike three (we'll keep going though).

They were, Israel claims they weren't, they have to provide hard evidence where these people lost that statue and their execution was necessary.

&#x200B;

*strike four:*

>Your next claim was that all three fell under Hors de Combat. Hors de Combat only applies in the following cases:  
>  
>(a) anyone who is in the power of an adverse party;  
>  
>(b) anyone who is defenseless because of unconsciousness, shipwreck, wounds or sickness; or  
>  
>(c) anyone who clearly expresses an intention to surrender; provided he or she abstains from any hostile act and does not attempt to escape.  
>  
>As none of them were captured, defenseless, unconscious, shipwrecked, or surrendering the rule does not apply.

I never said all three were under hors de Combat, I said Israel committed this war crime, according to your definition, one of the men who has been hospitalized for a few weeks enjoyed this statute, it also seems that one of the men was sleeping, they also enjoy hors de combat.

Now please if you actually want to debunk these claims, you have to do 3 things, prove that the three men were part of active hostilities meaning Israel had no choice but to kill them, and that none of the 3 men was enjoying hors de combat., and quote IHL for me

I was having an argument with someone over a discord group that claimed Netanyahu is moderate compared to other parties in Israel. Even with Itamar Ben-Gvir in the party Netanyahu can’t choose who’s in the party like the USA does and they need to fill seats.

Some arguments made for him being moderate is the fact that Israel has universal healthcare and lgbtq rights, as evidence he’s moderate but every article I’ve seen describes him as Israel’s most right wing government in history. 

Others point to the racist cabinet members, the nationalism, settlement expansion, the ultra orthodox members in the cabinet, crackdown on freedom of speech.

IsraelPalestine,comment,Universal healthcare,kchuvet,mashd_potetoas,,"Firstly, Netanyahu specifically is not anything. He is a self entitled wannabe dictator with a Messiah complex.

However, he is currently leading the most extreme right wing government in Israel's history.
In order to understand how that happened you need to understand Israeli politics.

In short, it's a mess.
Basically anyone can form a political party to run for parliament. When people vote, they don't elect a prime minister, or even a ruling party, they just give a vote to a chosen party. Once the votes are counted, a different number of seats (out of 120) are assigned to different parties according to the percentage of votes. Parties without enough votes for one seat (and there are too many of them every time) usually give away their votes to a bigger party that aligns with their agenda.

After all that's done, it is the elected but not yet officiated parliament's job to select a representative to be the one to assemble a majority of 61 seats to form a coalition.

So, it is traditionally given off to the leader of the party with the most seats - however, it is not mandatory and can create some wacky situations such as Bennet being PM with only 6 seats in 2021.

In any case, in the latest election Netanyahu needed to create a coalition at any cost, and desperately didn't want to join up with the other major mostly-left-wing party, and simultaneously these extreme right wing parties got more votes than expected, so that's how he has a Ben Gvir and a Smotritch in his ""party"".

So from all the pro Israelis i keep hearing the argument of self defense and the need to kill as many Hamas fighters as possible, who cowardly hide behind civilians so casualties are unavoidable. If we adopt this and think ahead, many Palestinians who are not fighters or extremist (majority are kids, eventually adults against Hamas but unable to act as freedom of speach is non existent) now will loose their kids, family members, friends, even journalists and doctors are getting killed. Even if the majority of current Hamas members get killed, what do yall think the survivors opinion on israel will be? Would they be happy they got saved after their whole bloodline gets annihilated? With schools destroyed and connection to outside world views mostly lost a lot of them get raised into the extremist narrative of Hamas aiming to a 1ss and kill all Jews. I think the current military action is not helping neither side and isnt damaging Hamas as much as alleged or moving Gaza to a more open democratic society. It is opening up a new argument for pro palestinians to say Israel doesn't want peace anymore, just killing as much palestinians as possible using bombs, starvation and missing health care is the objective.

If Israel really wants to defend its right to exist, why was the oct 7th attack even possible? If Israel right now knows where Hamas is located and where the hostages are and what they are planning, how did they not know that oct 7th will happen? It was a huge organized violent attack that needed weeks if not months to prepare. With the sheer amount of people involved i cannot fathom how israel didnt see it coming at all and reacted so slow and poorly. Clearly the border and defense system needs some investing instead of blasting the money of israeli and even american tax payers money as bombs on civilians who might have a terrorist under them. Its a huge waste and will make serious peace in the region impossible for quite some time.

What do you think will be the effects of this current conflict and how would you go on about a peaceful solution? Please dont give me single sentences like ""its simple "" ""... Is commiting genocide"" ""they started it"" "".. its not simple and i know i know please use more than one braincell for this discussion cause i am actually interested in your views.

This whole topic is so complex that any biases we have may drastically change our views. My condolences to the victims of oct 7th and their families and the victims of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in gaza caused by israels reaction to it.

You can blame Israel for the 7th of October all you want. Sure. It was a failure. However Israel's failure to stop a bunch of track pants wearing pizza delivery drivers from killing unarmed civilians doesn't mean they don't have a right to wage war and dig the rats out.


I'm asking you specifically to answer this. Are you honestly suggesting that instead of waging war, Israel should simply just invest in border security and let it go?

IsraelPalestine,comment,Single-payer system,kq44wub,turtleshot19147,,"Everyone who says that instead of taking military action, Israel should have focused on fixing their security mechanisms to ensure an attack like this wouldn’t happen again are generally the same people who claim the security mechanisms already in place are a form of oppression causing the Palestinians to “lash out” with terrorist attacks. 

Regarding destroying Hamas, there are two things needed to commit terrorist attacks and those things are the will to do it, and the capability to do it. So yes there will be lots of people with the will to carry on Hamas’ work, but they will have very low capabilities. Israel is working to destroy infrastructure. 

On that note, the big headlines everywhere are the numbers of innocent civilians killed and whether that’s justified and proportional. These questions are, in fact, not decided by laypeople reading the news around the world, there is international law specifically for determining these things. And the rule of law for these cases depend on the military benefit of the operation. It could very well be that some number of operations carried out by the IDF do not follow these laws and the military benefit did not outweigh the collateral damage. This would be a war crime and requires actual investigation by qualified bodies, not newspapers giving statistics and showing tragic photos. You never know if Israeli intelligence might show that certain operations very much did fall in line with international law. 

To be completely raw and honest, I think at this point what most israelis really want out of this war are two things:

1) our hostages back

2) no more hostages or massacres in the future

This leaves us in a spot where, for example, if one might argue that we can just get our hostages back if we pull out of Gaza, stop the war, and give in to all of Hamas demands, including freeing a huge amount of terrorist prisoners, then that doesn’t fit with the second point - that leaves Israelis knowing that Hamas is still around, we’ve provided them with lots more terrorists who had been in prison, they’ve vowed over and over that they’ll commit October 7 again, and we’re just leaving that be. 

So giving in to Hamas’ demands is not a viable solution, which means our hostages are still there, so the war continues.",2024-02-12T18:19:50+00:00
IsraelPalestine,comment,Single-payer system,kq4fp03,CheeezyDibbles,,"A few things to unpack here

Firstly the argument of creating more terrorists is a question we will never really know the answer to. The question is if it changes anything? Maybe we will know more in 10 years time. 
There was a guy who’s parents got killed on 7/10 after Hamas fired an rpg at their house. He teamed up with a Palestinian who also lost his father and made a peace campaign. A rare story for sure, but it doesn’t always mean radicalisation, is my point. 

I’ll skip the victim blaming. If you want to read about how they didn’t see 7/10 coming, well there are a few videos / articles I’m sure you can find about it. 

If the strategy and campaign will help in the long run, again we will have to see in 10 years. At the moment there is the fog of war and no one really knows what’s going on

The problem I have with your initial question is the lack of alternative solution. You will see that the UN or anyone who criticises what is going on offers no alternative. Pro Palestinians offer no alternative apart from ceasefire, do nothing. 

Maybe there is no alternative? I really don’t know 

I for one can’t think of an alternative that make sense, and I think about it alot as this conflict affects me personally, and I have friends who suffered immense loss on 7/10. 

Maybe they should have just made a buffer zone and filled it with mines and give up on the hostages and suck up the mortars and rockets and whatever else will come in 10 years.  Maybe nothing should have been done. 

Let me ask you this. If Hamas want to do another 7/10 do you think they have a chance? They have 2 battalions left. If your answer is no, then you probably have answered your own question",2024-02-12T19:20:59+00:00

3. They need to realize that the Almighty might not agree to the current actions. That what they love (the unending war with Israel), the Almighty hates. The Gazans must realize that fighting Israel is a hated thing by the Almighty. They need to look at Gaza on Oct 6th (contrary to the propoganda, Gaza was a pretty great place to live. The so called ""prison"" is a lie.) and look at Gaza now, and they need to rethink.

Every poll shows it, and anyway, people casually argue in defense of it even on this sub, never mind pro-Palestinian subs that are so explicit about it.  

Second of all, that logic would mean no war should ever be fought because every side is just creating more enemies. Obviously there is no basis in reality to that. Wars are fought, and wars are won. They always have been in human history. Society understands that sometimes, a war has to be fought.  

If the concern is further radicalization after the war, that's only a question for post-war strategies of how to rebuild and achieve peace. It is not an argument that Israel has to kowtow to invaders of its borders that slaughter its civilians.  

Frankly in my lifetime, this war is one of the most justified that I have seen. Fighting Al Qaeda after 9/11 compares (and for everyone that wants to say it, this isn't like the Iraq war. Hamas did their 9/11. Iraq didn't do 9/11.)",2024-02-12T17:18:38+00:00

The military action of israel will not create more terrorists. You can simply understand this from watching the kind of education kids get in gaza, and the amount of ""civilians"" working with hamas. Unrwa, guarding hostages, hospitals, tunnels. And also the elections right after israel decided to leave gaza. They chose hamas before israel bombed them. In general they started the war before israel used any violence at all..

Secondly the defense technology and military assets of israel are among the top tier around the world. The oct 7 fail is a proof that playing defense only will never be able to provide you with high chance of safety. If an enemy on your borders wants to attack you at some point he will succeed. So as they say, the best defense is a good offense. 

And that's why the military action is a must for israel. If they don't want to make peace with you, at least make them fear from you.

Remind you this tactic is normally how it works in most conflicts. Look at Germany, Japan in ww2 or if we look at israel wars with Egypt, Jordan, syria, and many muslim countries who make agreements with Israel in recent years, at the end they all respected the power of the opposition and chose to make peace.

Now the question is will it work with the palestinians? There are 2 ways to do it. One is a military operations similar to ww2 forcing the peace agreement.

IsraelPalestine,comment,Single-payer system,kq4ajtp,pbDudley,,"As a random person commenting on this forum: after Oct 7, Israel had to respond. 

The iron dome was literally developed to protect Israel from the random rockets being shot at them from Hamas. 

Israel has been allowing this for decades bc they didn’t want to get involved in Gaza. 

But enough is enough, so Israel had to put an end to this. And what we are seeing now is a very sad but necessary war. It’s sad bc Hamas is embedded in with the civilians of Gaza and this causes a lot of civilian casualties. 

Since HAMAS whole argument is really based on a 2 state solution, I’ll look at it as:

Remove HAMAS as much as possible(you can never really remove them completely it’s impossible) and assign some sort of Govt, perhaps the Jordanians or perhaps Palestinians who relocated to Europe/USA  could return to help with the governance. 

Then clearly I see the remaining democratic nations sending tremendous amounts of financial resources to re-build a better Gaza. But if we don’t remove Hamas from this equation that money will only be used by the Hamas leadership to live a more westernized type of life. 

We need the anti-Hamas arabs out there in the world to help with this is issue but at the same time Israel is going to have to be involved as well. 

Removing Hamas to a destitute small problem is the only solution. Once Gaza becomes a more (I hate to say it but it works)westernized country then they can flourish.

Long term benefits to Israel from current military actions

-seriously degrades Hamas military capabilities for a long time. Hamas/PIJ/other Gazans can seek revenge on Israel all they want but most of the cohesion and space to plan/train for large attacks like 10/7 is degraded, ability of Hamas to get materials for weapons is severely degraded, espexially if Israel gets some level of control over the Gaza-Egypt border

-take territory in northern Gaza, either as a no-mans land or with long-term military structures. A forward defense- the Gaza envelope, Israeli territory proper is no longer so close to Hamas

-a credible threat and deterrent to other groups including Hezbollah (and Iran) You won’t get a 1000 to 1 exchange for a hostage, we will salt the ashes of your cities, we have the willingness and ability to wreck you so don’t mess with us

-take as much leeway now for military action to change the circumstances on the ground because at other times/places Israel might get more pressure from countries like the U.S. to less fully complete Israeli military aims





Why did the 10/7 attacks get through? Israeli military hubris, good Hamas operational planning and operational security, and a maybe fundamental misunderstanding that Hamas was turning into effectively a frenemy- Hamas would manage Gaza so Israel didn’t have to, Hamas would lob rockets for legitimacy as a resistance group, Israel would kill some people or say here, have more $$/food etc if you don’t do rockets for a while, overall a status quo that was reasonably tolerable for both Hamas and Israel.",2024-02-12T17:18:47+00:00

1) Short term security - destroying the capabilities of Hamas, whether it's killing people that were trained combatants, destroying weapons sheds, costing Hamas a lot of time and money to return to a state where they can pull something close to October 7th.   


2) maintaining deterance. on October 7th, Hamas showed just how unprepared was the IDF. they showed that with a thought out plan you can attack Israel a lot. It's important to note that Hamas aren't close to the largest threats the Israel is facing. you have Hazbollah, you have Iran.. any situation where Hamas isn't removed from power and pays ""the ultimate price"" for it's attack is a situation where other organizatinons would think - ""OK, this is the price of attacking Israel, are we willing to pay it or not"". This isn't good for the security prospects of Israel.  


3) Removing Hamas from control of Gaza as a means to get closer to peace. Hamas controlled Gaza and Gazans fully. this included control of the education, media and economy to a large degree. Hamas had any incentive, and used it's power to radicalize the Palestinians. There isn't anything Israel could do to remove this effect because Hamas controls what's going on there. If Israel could weaken Hamas so much that another \*peace seeking\* group could grab hold of power and not fear that Hams fighters would battle with it - this could be a game changer for the peace process. Moreover, regardless of how Palestinians feel, it's very hard to negotiate any solution with Hamas. In the long term IMO is the best way Israel could insure it's security is by pushing for a two states. the only question is how to bring the Palestinians and their leadership to a place where they actually want it - and with Hamas (or other terror seeking groups) in power, I have no answer to this.",2024-02-12T18:39:16+00:00

Virtually all antisemitism that ever existed from the conversion of Paul and early Christianity, to the the Koran, the middle ages, etc. all the way to the Shoah and 1948 and modern antisemitism has happened as a consequence that, during times of trouble when Islamic and Christian societies needed to self-affirm, they did so by destroying Jews and Judaism. 

It's not that those religions are built around the idea that every individual Muslim or every individual Christian should hate any individual Jews - not at all. But for their moral identity to exist, it has to rely on a version of revealed truth that essentially says that their groups are *the* groups that will finally substitute the Jews as the receiving end of divine favor. For Christians, it was all about building an ideology to stop early Christians from going to the religion of Jesus to look for any insights. For Muslims, it was about exposing the failure of Jews in keeping up their end of the alliance with G'd, begging the conclusion that they are the true heirs of the alliance and Jews deserve a second-class status under their 'protection'.

In the 18th and 19th century, Jewish enlightenment (*haskala*) proposed the idea that European society had become more secular and rational. The hypothesis was that, if only the Jews followed suit, we would finally earn our place as equals and at last end almost 2 millennia of murder and oppression from Christians. In January of 1895, as he watched the mob hurl antisemitic insults towards Alfred Dreyfus, Herzl realized that idea had failed miserably and solidified Zionism as a movement by writing *Der Judenstaat.*

By bringing about the Zionist ideals and establishing the state of Israel in 1948, the Jews reversed centuries of slave morality into one of the most powerful expressions of master morality. So much that Jewish self-determination is now valid for every Jew everywhere, even for those Jews who decide not to make use of it. Before Israel, any ambivalence about Jewish identity was settled by a gentile society keen on making use of the Jew to fix their societal unity issues. Now, ambivalence is an insurance policy for Jews, to be exercised at their own discretion. And the reasons why Jews don't make use of that insurance policy may vary.

We should remember that the *haskala* ideals have not died: they still live today within the tenets of the Reform and Conservative movements in the United States. The strong adherence of those movements with ideals of equality in Religious ritual, merged with progressive ideals of social reform brought mainly from the Frankfurt School, created a uniquely Jewish expression that contributed enormously to the civil rights movement  as well as for fostering social justice values today. However, in spite of the enormous contributions of the Jews to the American experiment, the *haskala* ideals have failed there too. My synagogue worships under constant police protection, a mere 12 minutes drive from the gates of the White House. The very social justice values American Jews in academia and society helped make popular in the 60s and 70s by the first and second generation post-holocaust are now being weaponized against all Jews worldwide. It's important to note that progressive values are not under indictment: they remain as valid as ever. And it's because their truth became so self-evident that those values, when juxtaposed with age-old antisemitic tropes, are becoming the very fabric of the new antisemitism. The tool that weaves that fabric is anti-zionism.

The United States is today, quite literally, a do-over of 19th century Germany and France. Actual violence and murder remain isolated incidents, but it's now not only completely acceptable but fashionable to bring back ages-old anti-semitic tropes, as long as those tropes come under the guide of anti-zionism. Anti-zionism became a get-out-of-jail free card for antisemitic psychological violence that would make the likes of Richard Wagner or Edouard Drumont smile in joy.

Anti-zionism has also become a tool to force Jews to renounce indelible parts of their identity. For students and faculty, membership in certain progressive academic circles now require a public denouncement of Zionism, very often encouraged by tenured faculty, in a display of forced public humiliations not seen since the Spanish inquisition - when those converted to Christianity by force or decree were forced to denounce or physically deface Jewish symbols on the pain of torture, expulsion or even death. Harassing, shaming, boycotting, silencing, and even adding some degree of physical altercation to enforce all of the above is something completely acceptable on University campuses everywhere. Responses from University officials are stern, but completely spineless and meaningless. There are literally no consequences, making Jews on campus captive audience.

In the UVA campus in Charlottesville, anyone can notice that *Free Palestine* graffiti is ubiquitous. This is the same city that not long ago hosted a torch-in-hand nighttime rally at the sound of an almost all-male chorus forcefully intoning *'Jews will not replace us'*. While the students who perform the former will almost invariably rebuke the latter, few if any will notice the glaring performative contradiction.

Naturally, most Jews today remain skeptical that things might take a turn for the worse. Shockingly, and similarly, most Jews in Europe in the 1890s were also skeptical. How can their enlightened efforts to blend in and add value to secular society at large remain unnoticed? We're talking about societies built on religious principles built specifically to deny Jewish religion and morality. Sure, the theological varnish no longer shines as much, but the core morals are just as valid today as they used to be. As soon as Jews fall prey to complacency and slave morality when it comes to defining their identity, gentiles will step in and define it for all of us - and anti-zionism is a tool perfectly suited for that purpose.

Any further speculation on how things could get worse would be unhealthy paranoia at this point. But at least I can conclude that whereas it's pointless to discuss *how* things might get worse for Jews, it's completely irrefutable that they *can*. It's just a matter of keep watching for the signs, and remember our insurance policy.",2021-08-01T06:06:35+00:00

For one thing.   And you seem very smart.   So I'm just going to throw this out there.

From most angles that I can determine, right now.   In this present day.   The Zionists have won.  You have a strong nation.   Backed by a superior military force.  You have a pretty good society for your citizens.   You made it..and I think that was great that the Zionist were able to accomplish this.  A homeland for ethnic Jews.   Which considering the persecution of the Jewish people, you should have had a long time ago.

I don't know about Zionism.   Are you just a Zionist or do you care about the rights of everyone, including those who are not Jewish?

I mean, what you say is a wonderful speech for Israel.   But you didn't mention much about the Palestinians.   Can there be Zionist who also want to work on helping both the Palestinians and the Jews?   I think so.   And a strong Zionist.  Would want a homeland for the Jews, but would also want to have peace with the minority groups who also live with the territory of the Jewish home land.

Don't get me wrong.   I'm so glad the Jewish people have a homeland.   But let me use Canada as an example.

European settlers who came to Canada, formed a pretty good country.   I guess the biggest religion here is Christianity.   It's the biggest religion in the world actually..

.if some one posted something about how great and wonderful Canada is, based on Christian idealogy?

It would leave a sour taste in my mouth.   I mean don't get me wrong.  Most Christian people are good people.   But are they humble?

A truly strong Christian, would speak of Canada as a great nation.   Not just because of Christianity....but all the peoples, including the French and Indigenous, who together make it great.

But....to truly make a statement about Canada's greatness.   I think an understanding of our mistakes and flaws is important too.  How we killed off First Nations people.   How First Nations people still don't have clean water.   The opiate crisis.   To admit our faults, but state ideas and plans to make Canada great for all peoples...not just Christians

Plus I have to say.   The Old Testament is extremely violent.  I truly hope Zionist don't base their society on such a book.  The secular laws...like in Canada, we have charter of rights (which like you say, came from Judaism as foundation).   Are important too.  And I'm sure Israel as a democracy has incorporated some of them.   From what I understand, homosexuals are not persecuted in Israel, as bad as they are elsewhere.

As for actual comparisons between Jewish refugees and Palestinian refugees, Jews (like most refugees) stop being refugees once they have been integrated into a safe country. You seem to confuse being in the diaspora and wanting to return ""home"" as the definition of refugee when it is not. On the other hand, Palestinians who were born in other countries and who are citizens of those countries are considered to be refugees by UNRWA despite not fitting the actual definition of refugee and are the only group to receive such privileges.

Ultimately, those who control a territory have a say in who is allowed in or not and that applies to every country on earth.

Now, according to the Arab world and the far-left, the country that should absorb the Palestinians is: Also Israel!! No f you don't see how this is outrageous, let me spell it out for you. Israel is supposed to absorb every refugee of the conflict! Every last one. Because the Arab League is not complaining for accepting any Jewish refugee back. No other country is expected to accept even a single refugee back. Only Israel. What kind of resolution to the refugee problem you reckon that is?!

Also, I want to remark that many of the laws which the left calls ""apartheid"" laws actually makes sense if you consider the Jewish refugees.

""Israel won't let Palestinian refugees return""? 
Yeah, because (as I outlined above) it can't be the only country expected to accept refugees.

""Israel grants Jewish refugees the 'Law of return' while withholding a 'Right of return' for Palestinians""?
Yeah, because the expelled Jewish refugees needed a new state certain where they could be safe, integrate, and start a new life.

""Israel demolished the Palestinian villages""?
Yeah, because they needed space to settle the Jewish refugees.


I understand Palestinian refugees in 1948 were upset about being uprooted. But population exchanges like this have happened hundreds of times throughout history, yet they're the only ones still whining about it 75 years later. If the Palestinian refugees then had moved on, as the Jewish refugees did, the Palestinians today wouldn't be suffering, same as Mizrahi Jews today aren't.

I've come to this subreddit to understand more of this very complex conflict. I'm struggling to find my opinion in the extremely complex history of this era, and try to navigate between different resources and their subjective backgrounds.

I'm a historian, with special interest in WW2. I've spent my free time during my studies educating teens in high school about the horrors of the Shoa, on a voluntary basis. I feel that I have to mention that, to not immediately be called an anti-Semite, as I will now continue to explain that despite all understanding I have for the Jewish state and its trauma, I cannot unsee that conflict is turning into a genocide on Palestinian people. I will now explain how I see things.

History can be interpreted in many different ways. Based on history, either side could defend their opinion of having the right to live on the Israeli/Palestinian land. What happened to Israel on 7/10 is absolutely horrific and I deeply feel for the Israeli people and the families involved. This should never have happened, it is important that we recognize that this is the deadliest attack on Jewish people since the Shoa. Of course Israel can defend its country, also if that means to hunt for Hamas terrorists in the Gaza strip. And as in any war, unfortunately civilians will die while the real terrorists are being killed. This is horrible, and something we should not think lightly about, but I understand that that is what happens during war time. 

But when big, independent, respectable charity organizations such as Unicef, Doctors Without Borders mention colossal human suffering and a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, when Oxfam and Human Rights Watch are highlighting that hunger is being used as a weapon of war, how is this all still justified? For me, at this point, nothing justifies that. The price that is being payed is way too high. Civilians are pushed in a corner, being starved. From my perspective, this cannot be morally defended anymore. 

All I want is for the Israeli hostages to be brought back immediately, I cannot imagine their suffering, and the suffering of their family, and the suffering of all of Israel, as a state with massive (intergenerational) trauma. But I also need the horrors in Gaza to stop, all the ten thousands of innocent people who are now starving every minute of every day, heavily traumatized, deprived of all they have, to be safe.

Doctors Without Borders says there is human suffering, its their mission to worry about that...but is that the proper way to measure a war?

The accusations of using hunger as a weapon of war are actually something to be concerned about, something to look into. There have been several posts analyzing this, you're welcome to scroll down a bit in the sub. With reference to the two organizations you mentioned specifically....I never know how to respond.

My question is: do you think any of this might slightly taint the label you gave these organizations- ""independent, respectable charity organizations""?

IsraelPalestine,comment,Deductibles,ky5az1o,Nomad8490,,"I am also interested in civil discussion.

I'm going to use the word Arab here. This is not to deny the cultural identity Palestinians have developed since 1948, when Jordanians became Jordanians etc., but because a) until then, local Jews were also Palestinians and b) historically, the group that is now called Palestinians is not that culturally separate from those from the countries that are now their neighbors. And I think that's significant.

Numbers wise, there is no question that the Arab population in the region has consistently risen since the creation of Israel. And as horrific as the numbers coming out of Gaza are, they are not statistically significant in a way as to affect that. So the only question here is as to whether there is a cultural genocide taking place.

Before I return to that, it's undeniable that what Hamas wants is genocide of the Israeli people. For every bomb the IDF drops that hits civilians, we must remember that Hamas was trained to systematically rape on Oct 7; that they literally threw grenade after grenade into cement bomb shelters packed full of civilians, with no other target beyond killing civilians. This attempt at physical genocide is also supported by the efforts of cultural genocide throughout the Arab world, wherein Jews have been systematically ethnically cleansed in ancient and recent history. This is also supported by a long history of Arab colonization and ethnic cleansing in general, practices that have oppressed many ethnic, religious and cultural groups. I don't say this to whatabout or both-sides the situation, but to point out that it is precisely this genocidal force that Israel is currently responding to and attempting to stop. They are, essentially, in an us-or-them situation.

So, returning to whether a cultural genocide is now taking place in Gaza. I guess it comes down to whether you believe that after just under 20 years of isolation, Gaza is in fact its own culture. And if not, people in the West Bank and diaspora Palestinians must also be included. And then the question becomes--and I think this question is ripe for a lot of Israelis--whether 75 years of being deemed separated from Syrians, Lebanese, Jordanians, etc. by the UN, who were largely Europeans at the time, makes Palestinians their own culture, as opposed to being part of the greater Arab culture. How we answer these questions will determine whether cultural genocide is taking place. We may have different answers, and therefore different determinations. 

Gaza is a tiny part of Israel, but Israel is a tiny part of the middle east, which is largely Arab. The rest of the Arab world is not willing to take Palestinians in. Even when they are, even Palestinians literally have citizenships to other places, were born abroad, and have never been inside the west bank or Gaza, UNRWA's definition of refugeehood makes them perpetual refugees of Palestine--the only group in the whole world for which this is true. The whole Arab world is devoted to ensuring Palestinians stay in this position, both on paper through this definition of refugee and literally for those who are not allowed entrance to another Arab country, in order to keep them separate. And why? Because the goal is, has always been, to deny the Jews a state. A state that was built on the threat/fear of genocide (1920s-1930s Zionism) and then a response to the actual event that caused us to define the word genocide (1948 and beyond). To deny them a safe place to be anywhere in the Arab world; to take everything from the river to the sea. That's the goal of Palestinian leadership (the PA aside, which most Arabs find laughable) and of nearly all Arab countries. 

I don't know that any of this will help you unsee genocide. If you see genocide here, you see it, and that's your right. We are all entitled to opinions. Yet my hope is that by putting what is currently happening in its greater context of a massive genocide and ethnic cleansing soup, which I believe is it's rightful context, whether cultural genocide is taking place would no longer be the determining factor in how you see this whole thing.

Ultimately, I really want peace in the region. Less death. Less violence. There were moments when that was almost possible--Oslo, Camp David, most recently when the Saudis and the UAE were starting to cooperate with Israel on economic ventures. This most recent one ended on Oct 7 with Hamas (and surely Iran, whose fingers are long, and likely Qatar) reminding the Jews of their goal: genocide, the destruction of the Israeli state, from the river to the sea.

Well, there's your problem. You assume that these organizations are reliable and honest in their reporting about Israel. They've always had an anti-Israel bent, and that's not necessarily because they're interested in human rights.

None of these organizations actually understand how international law and warfare work. They just think that whenever Israel bombs a building, it's a warcrime. At the same time, they also largely ignore actual human rights atrocities in other countries. You don't have to be a media expert to see that they only target Israel, and they almost never go after countries like Iran and China. Or almost any Arab country who are completely dismal on human rights. Even if they did, the human rights orgs overwhelmingly go after Israel.

To get a better understanding of how actual warfare law works and how Israel is complying with international law, I'd suggest you read [this paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2593629) on Israeli targeting.

I love how the left is now adopting the stance of “being on trial means you are guilty” specifically for Israel.

Kind of like how “believe all women” changed to “me too, unless it’s a Jew” after the mass denial of the rapes committed by Hamas on Oct 7th.

Have you read South Africa’s filing?  It’s a joke lol.

They literally argue that the fact that it’s harder to access maternal healthcare during the invasion in Gaza proves Israel is intentionally trying to stop Palestinians from having birth.

IsraelPalestine,comment,Deductibles,ky9a6ja,Fairfax_and_Melrose,,"Thank you for trying to approach your learning about this conflict and my culture in a balanced and open way.  That’s rare these days.

As a peaceful Israeli American, I’d like to share some important points from the Israeli perspective…

* Disclaimer:  I’m extremely critical of the Netanyahu government and the way the IDF is conducting itself.  They are disregarding civilian safety in large decisions and allowing a culture of racism and vengeance to persist among individual soldiers without repercussion.  My points below are in response tot be question of genocide.

1) 15% of Israeli citizens are Muslim Palestinians.  The idea that Israelis want to harm Palestinians because of who they are (which is a defining component of genocide) is very strange to us because if we wanted to harm them we wouldn’t have to go to Gaza to do it.

2) The violence would end immediately if Hamas returned the hostages and recognized Israel’s right to exist.  I’m not aware of any genocide in history where the victims could simply choose to stop the violence.

3) To say this war zone is extremely unique and complex is cliche but true.  According to Hamas, 40,000 of the 2,000,000 residents of Gaza are registered Hamas militants.  That’s 1 of every 50 people (1 of every 25 adults).  Combine that fact with Hamas’ tactic of embedding in the civilian population and you have a war where impossibly difficult decisions have to be made every day, yet Israel’s critics ascribe every civilian death and tragedy to malice. 

4) Israel has made repeated efforts to clear civilians from battle zones.  Most notably, they’ve tried to get Egypt to allow them through the border.  I understand the charges that this is a tactic of ethnic cleansing.  I disagree, but there’s no denying it’s a legitimate concern.  The telling thing about this issue is that Gazans don’t get to choose whether they leave for Egypt.  Egypt is keeping them trapped in Gaza.  So, again, critics assume Israel is targeting civilians with genocidal intent when they’re constantly trying to move civilians out of the way.

5) I don’t defend the restrictions on journalists and basic aid.  The issue of aid in the north where Hamas does not have control is especially damning.  I think many Israelis argue that much more aid is getting through than social media critics imply and that getting aid through is much more complicated than anyone realizes in this context.",2024-04-06T00:51:36+00:00

Almost like there are spectrums. You have extreme autism and then you have people who are on the lower end. Then you have people who are not on the spectrum, but will have tendencies where you are like, they could be on the spectrum.

Looking at where the term genocide was developed, that is an extreme case (WW2). Gas chambers, starving people, working people to death, torture, obviously quantity of death, and goal of 100% destruction of individuals. 

Looking at the Palestine situation, I would agree based on the UN definition, you might be able to stretch the idea of tendencies that a genocide is happening, but to me, they are just tendencies and don't reach the lowest level of it being classified as a genocide.",2024-04-05T11:56:18+00:00

Even in Syria the scale of death and displacement is 10x larger and hardly anyone says a word.

Plus the 30,000 figure consisting mostly of civilians comes directly from Hamas with highly questionable underlying stats, whereas by Israel’s count nearly half the Palestinian casualties were combatants. It’s far too early to draw conclusions until the dust has settled and independent investigators can safely assess the situation on site.

Personally I would call this campaign a genocide if it ends with Israel colonizing Gaza and not letting civilians return to their homes to rebuild. If Gazan civilians are ultimately permitted to return to their homes, then the campaign can instead be legitimately considered a standard national security operation in a densely populated warzone full of human shields.",2024-04-05T17:15:57+00:00

""A doctor at a field hospital for detained Palestinians at Israel’s Sde Teiman army base has described “deplorable conditions” and “routine” amputations due to handcuff injuries, according to an exclusive report from the newspaper Haaretz.

In a letter to Israel’s attorney general and defense and health ministers, obtained by Haaretz, the doctor said the conditions at Sde Teiman field hospital compromise inmates’ health and violate medical ethics.

“Just this week, two prisoners had their legs amputated due to handcuff injuries, which unfortunately is a routine event,” the doctor said in the letter, according to the Haaretz report on Thursday. He wrote that inappropriate care at the detention facility has led to “complications and sometimes even in the patient’s death,” adding that “this makes all of us – the medical teams and you, those in charge of us in the health and defense ministries, complicit in the violation of Israeli law.”

The medical source, who spoke to CNN on Thursday on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said all the Gazan detainees they saw at the field hospital had all four limbs shackled, which the source said increases the risk of blood clotting and other health concerns.

The source said the detainees were blindfolded and that at least three patients they saw were wearing diapers.

The medical source highlighted the systematic “dehumanizing” of detainees at the field hospital, which they described as a large “tent” that is “not insulated” from the elements.

“We were asked not to use our names,” the medical source told CNN, adding that the Gazan prisoners were identified by serial numbers, rather than their names.""",2024-04-08T10:28:48+00:00

IsraelPalestine,post,Medicaid,1auvvlc,wefarrell,Future of this conflict as the US withdraws from the Middle East,"One thing that I haven't seen discussed much on here is the US drawdown in the middle east and what it means for the future of this conflict. US support for Israel has been vital for Israel's security, most importantly by supporting governments in the region that cooperate with Israel such as Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, etc... However these dynamics are changing and I believe this will be the dominant theme of the Middle East over the next several decades.

Historically, the Middle East been strategically important to the US for the following reasons:

* Oil: The discovery and exploitation of vast oil reserves in the Middle East, particularly in places like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq, became crucial for global energy supplies. The US, as a growing industrial power, recognized the importance of these resources.
* The Cold War: The onset of the Cold War post-1945 heightened the Middle East's strategic significance. The US aimed to prevent the spread of Soviet influence in this region, which was seen as vital for geopolitical and economic reasons.
* Iranian Revolution: Iran shifted from being a close ally of the US to a major adversary, greatly increasing Israel's importance as an ally.

Why this has changed in recent history:

* Oil independence: The US now produces more oil than it consumes and is no longer dependent on exports from countries in the Middle East.
* Pivot to Asia: The US foreign policy focus has been gradually shifting towards other regions, notably the Asia-Pacific, due to the rise of China as a global economic and military power.
* War Fatigue: The prolonged military engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan, with their high economic and human costs, have led to a degree of war fatigue among the American public and policymakers. This has spurred a desire to avoid large-scale military interventions, particularly in the Middle East.
* Budget Constraints: The Debt to GDP ratio is higher than at any point in US history and the aging population and ballooning healthcare costs will reduce the overall budget.

As a result the US has been significantly reducing it's military presence in the region and has shrunk bases in Iraq, Syria, and Saudi Arabia and shrinking it's naval presence in the Red Sea. In order to ensure the future of Israel's security, the US has been encouraging regional alliances and partnerships, like the Abraham Accords, which aim to stabilize the region with less direct U.S. involvement. 

In September of 2023 Israel and Saudi Arabia were in talks to normalize relations, but paused those discussions after October 7th and the War in Gaza. Personally I think it can't be a coincidence that Hamas (who are backed by Iran) waged an attack that drove a wedge between the US' strongest two allies in the region while they were in the middle of normalizing relations.

Partially reducing its presence in the region will not have significant impact.

Biden definitely pulled a Carter and hesitated on closing that deal so Trump got no credit for it. Scrambling to wrap it up before the election year, I think he might have pushed a little too forcefully when we already know Saudi was babysitting and restricting allowances to the intruders since 2016. 

All that said, I think it was a huge shock to see Hamas was capable of so much destruction when they’re normally way too disorganized. It then came as no surprise that they’d been training in Iran for this. 

While war is never the goal, the silver linings of the terrible situation are that we are effectively through the blow up that had been brewing and we are seeing the true faces of East vs west power.. and their capabilities to control avoidance of tipping the scales with Saudi. 

Putin immediately thanked Hamas Oct 8. NK has formally announced support for Hamas and Hamas thinks they’re moving forward steadily with nukes for America. China, in this major stall for tech advancement for the west with Israel tied up, has gone full Harry Potter with an invisibility cloak. 

Bottom line: I don’t think America will be pulling out any time soon. With any brains, we’ve continued to steadily learn from NK that fully disengaging is ineffective in totality.",2024-02-20T18:47:03+00:00

IsraelPalestine,post,Medicare,wdisc2,hononononoh,Protectorates as a possible solution to the problem of maintaining a Jewish majority in Israel,"A protectorate is a type of associated state, whereby a smaller and weaker state falls under the military and trade protection of a larger and more powerful (""protector"") state, while retaining autonomy in all other matters, such as foreign affairs and internal law and infrastructure (""home rule""). The protector state, meanwhile, gets privileged access to the protectorate's markets, both for goods and labor.

I don't care to get into the semantic debate over whether ""protectorate"", ""associated state"", and ""trust territory"" are just euphemisms for ""colony"" or ""annexation"". One thing I've learned in getting into this conflict, is that words matter. What something is called matters. Because pride and a sense of control over their own destiny is exactly what's on the line for Palestine. The Palestinians say, ""Stop humiliating us and we'll stop attacking you."" The Israelis say ""Stop attacking us, and we'll stop humiliating you."" This solution could be a win-win. Palestine gets a large degree of official and legally codified autonomy, and gets the freedom to function and carry itself as a fully sovereign nation, or alternatively, a series of microstates. Israel, meanwhile, gets out of the charges of having a boot on Palestine's neck, while at the same time having a monopoly on violence in Palestine. Israel also gets a clear-cut *casus belli*, under International Law, if rebels in the Protectorate of Palestine instigate violence against Israel.

Consider the status of Palau. Legally, Palau is a sovereign nation. But it is a state in free association with the USA. The USA provides Palau's military defense, and reserves the right to intervene in Palau's foreign trade. In return, Palauan citizens and their descendants have indefinite right of abode in the USA, and vice versa. Palau and the USA have much less restricted access to each other's markets than either country does with most other sovereign states, which has (mutually favorable) implications for taxation, tariffs, and availability of goods and services. As a USA-trained medical doctor, licensed to practice in at least one US state, I wouldn't need to take the Palauan medical licensing exam or apply for a work visa, in order to practice in Palau. I would just need a letter of intent to hire from a Palauan medical facility, and a copy of my currently valid state license in the USA, and the Palauan government would issue me a Palauan medical license. Palauans can enlist and serve in the US military, with no threat to their Palauan citizenship — something even American Jews who enlist in the IDF can't say. (Yes, I'm aware the US government turns a blind eye to people who do this in Israel, for now at least. But technically speaking, serving in a foreign military is grounds for forfeiting US citizenship, and/or facing charges of treason.)

The US dollar is the official currency of Palau. Palauan and English are co-official languages there.

That said, Palauans are *not* US citizens. Even if they abide on US soil their entire lives, unless they naturalize like any other foreigner, they cannot vote or hold public office. And with the exception of military benefits for those who've served in the US Armed Forces, they are not eligible for government benefits like welfare, unemployment, Medicare or Medicaid, or social security. The same, naturally, holds true for US citizens who have taken up abode in Palau. They may live and work there as long as they please. But government participation and services are for locals only.

What if Israel and Palestine were to codify and begin a relationship similar to the USA and Palau, respectively? Palestine could either be one unitary entity, noncontiguous geographically, but under one government. (Like the islands of Palau.) Or it could be a collection of microstates, each independent not only from Israel, but from each other as well. (Like the United Arab Emirates as British protectorates.)

* Citizens of Israel would have free right of abode and employment in Palestine, but suffrage and public-sector employment only in their country of citizenship, and vice versa.
* Palestine gets no independent military; defense is Israel's responsibility. Citizens of Palestine may electively enlist in the IDF, after which they are entitled to all benefits given to Israeli citizens after compulsory service. Including a fast track to applying for Israeli citizenship as non-Jews.
* Israeli citizens who abide and/or work in Palestine pay taxes to their host state, but are not eligible for Palestinian government benefits and services, and vice versa.
* The New Israeli Sheqel remains the currency for both states
* No tariffs on items imported from Palestine to Israel, or vice versa.
* No Israeli interference in Palestine's internal affairs, or foreign relations. That said, Israel reserves the right to fortify and seal its technically external border with Palestine like any other, and reprise any attacks on the defense forces stationed right outside, but *completely* outside, Palestine's borders, if needed. Visa-free right of abode and right to work does not necessarily mean a completely unguarded border like the Schengen Zone.
* The state (or microstates) of Palestine may control their own airspace and seacoast, with the caveat that Israel reserves the right to intervene, should any evidence arise of goods and people entering Palestine that threaten Israeli interests. As is and was the case for any protectorate or similar type of associated state.
* Each state responsible for its own infrastructure, with the benefit of privileged access to the other's market for goods and labor

And... **drumroll please...**

Right. Of. Return. *sigh*

* Israel and Palestine each get their own discretion as to who may immigrate to their state and naturalize there. But both limit the mutual right of abode and right of employment to citizens of their respective country *from birth*. What this means is that one of the few remaining 1948 Palestinian Refugees would be eligible to live and work in Israel, but not their grandchildren who have arrived in Palestine for the first time in their lives, nor any Palestinian refugee camp dweller who can't prove any old and established ties to Israel or Palestine's current borders. Their Palestine-born children, though, *would* be eligible. **So, post-Nakba right of return, without the threat of a loss of a Jewish voting majority**
* By the same token, diaspora Jews who make *'Aliyah* to Israel, would not be eligible for right of abode and employment in Palestine. **So, no more militant and fundamentalist foreign Jews establishing and trickling into West Bank Settlements.**

IsraelPalestine,comment,Medicare,iik8mcu,hononononoh,,"Thank you, man. I appreciate it. Hard-line militancy and hawkishness may dominate Palestinian public opinion these days. You'd know much better than I, and *please* correct me if I'm wrong, but this is what I'm consistently hearing, more often than not. I also consistently hear that there is no talking, reasoning, bargaining, or tricking the angry, vindictive, militant, pride-hurt Palestinian majority out of their views toward Israel, and that I'm clueless Western idealist for even suggesting such a thing. But history unfolds in unexpected ways and throws us curveballs, so I dare not ween that this will always be the case. But it may take some big unexpected external shock to shake things up.

Can you expand a bit more on currency and defense? The relevance of these two points isn't immediately obvious to me.

I could see it being fair that Palestine is allowed to have a home-sourced and trained Self Defense Force, like Japan is allowed to have. Ireland and Finland — both technically Third World countries in the original and truest sense of this horribly outdated term — also have nothing but a self-defense force, of their own choice. That said, the US Armed Forces still have bases and troops stationed in Japan. And yeah, the locals are understandably butthurt about it. Because it's not really much of a secret that the US is not in Japan to protect Japan, but to *protect the world from Japan*. Same reason we have bases in Germany. We're there so that if Japan or Germany act the fool again, we're right there to stomp them. We let both of these countries take care of their own internal defense, and respect their sovereignty. But the US military presence says it all. We're the eye in the sky. (And definitely the maker of rules for dealing with fools.)

Ireland is kind of a different situation. In some ways militarily, it's midway between Palau and Finland. It has its own homegrown self-defense force. But Irish nationals are still eligible to enlist in Her Majesty's Armed Forces, a full century after Ireland left both the UK and the British Commonwealth. The UK indeed still has military bases in Ireland, but only on the northern part of the Island that never seceded from the UK, so it's not quite like Japan or Germany. I'm rambling, but you get the point — there are different ways that the responsibilities of internal self-defense and peacekeeping, and external defense from foreign threats can be divvied up in an associated state, according to the needs of the population.

Of course, if one or more of these armed Palestine Self Defense Force units attacked Israel unprovoked, that would make a very strong argument for the nascent Protectorate of Palestine to be entirely disarmed, as it could not be trusted with even a homegrown self-defense force.

Now as for a different currency, I don't see why this is an inherently unreasonable request. This could give the Bank of Palestine a bit more control over the creation and maintenance of value within its borders. Now, whether or not it's a practical and helpful move (as opposed to a merely symbolic, and dare I say it, prideful one), that I can't say, because macroeconomics is something I know very little about.

I'm liking how this is shaping up. It's all about selling it the right way to the target audience, though. You can have the best idea in the world, but if you don't know how to pitch it and market it, you've got nothing. I sense that no matter what happens, Team Israel must make the Palestinians feel respected, taken seriously, and given face, the culturally appropriate Palestinian Arab way of showing this.

I really think this could purely be a case of presentation and face-saving. If I'm not mistaken, the Muslim world has a precedent of non-Muslim mercenaries (the Jannissaries of late medieval Turkey, for example) defending the *Ummah*. Frame Jewish Israelis as the guardians, defenders, and knowledge capital of an important piece of the historical Muslim homeland in diplomatic and soft power projecting literature.

I think of the concept of a worker getting ""kicked upstairs"": Promoted in name to spare his face, but demoted in reality.

Israel, France, UK, Japan, Australia? South Korea? Germany if they tried? Russia if it wasn't corrupt and incompetent? Saudi if they weren't spoiled? There's degrees of sovereignty there. 

Palestine is not sovereign and never will be. Accepting the lack of true sovereignty and dealing with partial autonomy is the best pathway to maximizing internal autonomy. Palestinians often insist on having all the respect they haven't earned yet, and are blatantly not worthy of at the moment of demanding, and imply that as soon as they are given all the respect and authority and responsibility that they absolutely cannot handle, they will fix all their problems which they can't possibly fix, and then everything will be fine.

I also, regardless of anything else, encourage the IDF to be as ethnically integrated and internally diverse as possible. If, like Palauans serving in the US Armed Forces, a Palestinian citizen opts to serve in the IDF, it would be with the understanding that he is the equal of any other enlisted man under Israel's equivalent of the UCMJ, including in responsibilities, pay, benefits, and rank advancement opportunities. No glass ceiling. Speaking of which, I mentioned ""enlisted"", but for full equality, I see no reason why, under my plan, Palestinian citizens wouldn't be equally as eligible as Israeli citizens to apply to one of the IDF's military academies. In which case a cadet and graduate would be the equal of any other *commissioned officer* in the IDF.

Last I heard, in a 1SS without Palestinian right of return, the citizenry would be about half Jewish and half non-Jewish. In a 1SS with maximal right of ~~return~~ *abode* for every UNRWA-registered ""Palestinian Refugee"" within Palestisrael's borders, Jews are quickly rendered very much a minority, with much less political clout as a community.

Now granted, there may be good arguments against this.

Too many civilians are being killed in Gaza
  

  
Too many IDF soldiers are dying.
  

  
Most hostages have not been released.
  

  
The humanitarian situation in Gaza is worsening by the day.
  

  
The public relations battle is clearly being won by Hamas for the above reasons Support for Palestinians, and even Hamas is growing around the world.
  

  
Hamas will never be eliminated militarily.
  

  
I think in the beginning Israel was counting on Egypt to open Gaza’s southern border and allow the Gazans access to Sinai. This would have opened up a long term potential solution to the Gaza problem, however Egypt isn’t budging. At this point Israel needs to regain international support. Only by an international campaign which would include sanctions on Iran and Qatar and any entity supporting or funding Hamas, seizure of Hamas assets, etc..will Hamas be stopped.
  

  
A ceasefire is Israel's best option at present to get the hostages back and regain public and international support. The objective of completely eliminating Hamas is unrealistic and the costs are too high.  Egypt has proposed a plan to get hostages back and also to control Gaza.  Getting Egypt is essential for obvious reasons and I think this plan should be given serious consideration by Israel, and hopefully Hamas.  Of course, Hamas is not trustworthy and probably cannot even control its own fighters or the multiple number of jihadist groups operating in Gaza, however, the Egyptian plan is the best and really only alternative at this point.  Israel can not win with the current strategy.  Bombing cities may have worked in WW2 but this isn't WW2.   Bombing German cities in WW2 and Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as brutal as that was, did help win a war in a situation where the enemy was clear and the public was firmly behind the Allies actions.  Here we have a divided public, a majority of the UN siding with the Gazans.   It's time to set back, ceasefire, rethink how to get a stable reliable Palestinian government.

Israel has 170,000 active duty officers, and if you take 1/3 of that number as combat units and the rest as support like most modern militaries, that means minus the dead and injured, there are still over 50,000 deployable soldiers on active duty right now.

This is not even beginning to include the over 400k personnel in reserve (and about 130,000 deployable troops from that pool).

And the thing is, the IDF doesn't actually have to lose another single soldier to destroy Gaza. They have the weaponry to glass the entire region without a single soldier setting foot within its borders. The reason any of Israel's soldiers are dead at all is *because* they are making a concerted effort to minimize civilian casualties by going in to take out Hamas soldiers. These men and women don't have to risk their lives because their country has the means to eradicate the enemy entirely from a distance.

It would be surely much humanly to say: ""we do take refugees, make programs to invite them and save the lives"".

But conditions are bad overall.  Plus, why celebrate good treatment of Hamas shouldn't have done so I'm the first place taking hostages?  And there's the question of numerous times Hamas broke the ceasefires (especially the one in November this year and the one predating 10/7). So long as the Iranian Regime for the Jihadist remains in power, Muslims and Palestinians won't have their freedom from the extremists.  And Hamas is barely the tip of the iceberg.

While antisemitism has grown, rather more exponentially there has been an explosion in normal people evaluating exactly how compatible Islamic values are with their own societies. To put it bluntly, it’s always been ‘en vogue’ to hate the Jews. The west has traditionally been incredibly tolerant of Islam. That worm has turned. Dramatically. 

We now see whole political systems lurching radically to the right. What’s the talking point? Ejecting Jews? Or ejecting Muslims?

Marine. Wilders. Orban. The Spanish crowd. The new Italian lady. 

Nobody is discussing limits on Jews. All the talk is on Muslims who have shown themselves to be wildly incompatible with western values.

• A future Palestinian state is not going to be contiguous. A third of Palestinians live in the coastal strip of land - Gaza. Gaza and the West Bank are separate geographical units. Any two state solution scenario requires a measure of discontinuity within territories under Palestinian rule. The unresolved issue is the extent of discontinuity.

You need to explain to me why the Israeli invasion of Lebanon has anything to do with the military challenged that may be posed by the Palestinian state.  Let me add that nobody takes this seriously

>Rockets?

Is that referring to Hamas firing the occassional firecracker?  In 2006, despite entreaties by Hamas, Israel decided to blockade Gaza from air, sea and land.  It created the largest concentration camp in the world with about 1.5 million inmates.  In case you do not know, blockades are acts of war.  So, why are you complaining for a few rockers, when you were the first to declare war against these people?  Don't they have the right to resist?  How would you have reacted if you were a prisoner in a concentration camp with no end in sight???  Let me know!!",2020-07-20T05:53:42+00:00

IsraelPalestine,post,Pre-existing conditions,1977lhz,reviloks,Hypothetical (but serious) question,"As someone with no immediate ""horse in this race"" I've often wondered how the whole Israel/Palestine conflict will eventually be resolved (if that will happen at all)

Peace will only be achievable if both sides are willing to compromise, and that means to give up something. For the Arab/Muslim world (gross generalization, I know) what they need to give up first and foremost is the idea that the whole nation of Israel should disappear, be it with or without their doing. It's not gonna happen.


Now, let's assume (purely hypothetical of course!) that the whole arab/muslim world (incl. Palestinians, Hezbollah, Iran, etc) worldwide unilaterally and truthfully declares that henceforth they will accept and respect the existence of Israel, and normalize relations with it, under ONE of the following conditions:

1) Gaza and all occupied territories of the West Bank, as well as East Jerusalem are yielded to the Palestinians and any and all Jewish settlements and colonies are effectively dismantled. No more Jewish presence in the future in those areas,except in compliance with Palestinian regulations. Basically a return to pre-1967 borders and a strict 2-state solution

or

2) Gaza and all currently occupied territories are officially annexed into ""Greater Israel"" but all Arab/Palestinian people that live in those lands are granted citizenship and 100% equal rights (legally, socially, voting, etc) as Israelis, making both Jews and non-Jews absolutely indistinguishable before the law for all intents and purposes. To ensure this, a strict separation of state and religion(s) modelled after French ""laïcité"" is required. I am aware that this would severly dilute the ""jewishness"" of Israel.

But for the sake of this little thought-experiment, I seriously wonder, which proposition would be acceptable to (most) Jews? Where do you/they draw the line?",2024-01-15T12:27:50+00:00

IsraelPalestine,post,Health insurance marketplace,r105ue,JeffB1517,Personal reflections on getting offended by the Western Hard Left / BDSers,"I thought I'd do a little public soul searching for today's post.  I'm going to use myself as sort of a case study on the hostility in the I/P debate.  One of the problems in the I/P debate is there are really many totally distinct groups that Jews need to debate with.  When it comes to anti-Zionism for college students especially the real opponent of Zionism / Jews that they most frequently encounter is the hard left.  Generally the counter debate by Zionists  focuses on three broad areas: 

* The moral aspect.  That is the hard left's critique depends on ferociously antisemitic presuppositions.  
* The practical aspect.  The hard left's plans in so far as they even exist are unworkable.
* The ideological aspect. The hard left's theories depend on assumptions that aren't broadly shared.  They are demanding things of Israel that they only theoretically demand of other countries.  

I'm not a college student.  And even my kid is past it now.  But it was concern for her welfare that originally moved me from being a strong Zionist to getting involved in anti-BDSism.   

The I/P debate is very unique.  But there is nothing unique about me disagreeing with the hard left on policy on moral, practical and ideological grounds.  When it comes to health policy, environmental policy, tax policy, regulatory policies... the hard left is often immoral, impractical or making wild ideological assumptions as well.  On about 95% of the points that Bernie Sanders disagreed with Hillary Clinton or say Amy Klobuchar I'd agree with Clinton or Klobuchar on moral and/or practical and/or ideological grounds. Similarly with say AOC.  And of course many SJP types are well to the left of Sanders or AOC making the problem worse.  Elizabeth Warren was a good compromise candidate because while she is still well to my left at least I and most moderate Democrats considered her to be a reasonable person, making reasonable policy proposals that would mostly make things better if enacted.  The furthest left the Democratic party could go and where I could still enthusiastically support the candidate.  Yes, I would have voted for Sanders over Trump, but it would definitely be a lesser of evils vote. If Sanders lost I would have been a lot more depressed about the choices than the election results.  Which is why I was the sort of person who rallied around Biden, even though I consider Biden in his prime to have been a vacuous blowhard, and Biden now is not remotely in his prime.  I was willing to compromise with black people on Biden even while strongly preferring Kloubachar, Bloomberg, Bennet,  Booker, Gillibrand, Hickenlooper type candidates. 

You could say I get more offended by anti-Zionism than say lousy environmental policy because it is a personal attack.  I got dragged into banking the last few years, other industries in between but about 1/2 my career has been in health insurance or insurance like healthcare.  The hard left's lies and stupidity when it comes to  health insurance is arguably just as much of a personal attack.  And certainly their policies on insurance lead me among other issues to not want to vote for them. In general though,  I don't vote for them because I don't want their policies to become law.  The lies and distortions including about insurance, become reasons not to trust them in terms of candidate integrity.  But they are not personally offensive in the same way anti-Zionism is.  If I had lived in say MO-1 I would have voted for  Anthony Rogers over Cori Bush in an untroubled way.  BDSism is a total deal breaker while Sanders' incredibly dishonest statements about insurance, banking, investing... are not.  That deserves a deeper dig which is what motivated this little diary. 

And the why here probably does deserve a response as to why.  One possibility about what makes the debate on Israel/Palestine unique is the combination of genuinely terrible analysis and policy with activism.  I think much more than the dumb policy it is the abusive and hostile activism I find really truly offensive. This isn't unique to Israel / Palestine I thought anti-Dakota Access Pipeline Protests were offensive, aggressive and sometimes violent.  And while I had no opinion on the pipeline before the protest, I became a supporter after.  BLM is probably the best case here to use as a case study as it is recent and it was very big so most people are familiar with it. 

BLM is hard to discern policy positions.  What they want is unclear and they are untroubled by this.  That's very similar to BDS which has aspirational goals that even their followers tend to deny.  I'd personally consider unclear policy positions or unclear means of achieving them rather disqualifying.  But where they do have positions I can often agree.  For example the most consistent policy of BLM as far as I can tell is that in prosecutions for police involved shootings should be done by someone other than the county DA should handle the prosecution as they must have a close working relationship with the police departments and thus have a conflict of interest.  I think BLM is right on this, this is good policy and if they focused on reforming this I'd easily support them.  No reason to take offense.  I find activism on this point destructive. I think a lobby rather than street activism would be a lot more effective in actually getting this reform enacted. Activism, especially activism that is done by rudely attacking police officers is offensive.  Police officers aren't the people in society who establish prosecutorial procedure. 

Similarly when BLMers express a desire to see financing and responsibility shift away from law enforcement and towards social services.  Here I strongly agree.  I think social workers can intervene more effectively and with greater long term benefits than police.  I agree strongly and really care about the policy enough that I'm really mad about the obnoxious behavior because I think it undermines a cause I strongly support. 

* Demands that police be denied due process especially a robust defense.  Here I disagree with the policy strongly. The obnoxious behavior doesn't change anything but it adds to my dislike the movement more even though I agreed with the first two points.  

So let's pick a point I disagree with on BLM on policy: police are obligated to de-escalate confrontation.   I disagree here. I think it is undermining to the very concept of the rule of law. The sword of the state should be feared.  Police in uniform are not just bureaucrats but rather represent the very force that makes law have more gravity than a policy statement from a corporation.   Someone who is aggressive towards the police should see escalation not de-escalation.  If they get violent with policy,  I don't have a problem with that resulting in greater violence.  In line with this when I see protesters getting to close to  police with ""f* you"" type expression or throwing a trash can at Philadelphia police... my reaction is  ""how dare you"".  Emotionally the debate isn't even a policy disagreement.  They have crossed the line from politics into crime. Ah this is getting closer to what I feel about BDS.  

In short, not shockingly for people who have seen how I moderate, tone really matters to me.  I see activism as making things worse not better.  I dislike activism and I tilt against positions I would otherwise embrace if expressed rudely.  BDS focuses very heavily on activism.   Terrible policy, irrational arguments, heavy focus on rude activism, obnoxious behavior and a personal attack.  It is pressing all of my buttons at the same time.  Those buttons get pressed by other causes but mostly not all at once.  

I can confirm that by noting that I don't have the same feelings towards actual Palestinians who aren't from the hard left.  Even when they express antisemitism because they aren't from the hard left there is at least the ability to discuss common morality and rational analysis.  If one removes the obnoxious activism say BDSers who are polite like Yousef Munayyer I actually like them, even while disagreeing with their policies.",2021-11-24T08:12:44+00:00

The unfortunate consequence of elevating a nation-state to a sacred realm is that you're going to feel very offended when someone challenges it, or doesn't believe in it. I think Jewish educational and religious institutions have failed to impart that reality on its congregants/students. Once they leave their community bubbles they encounter a serious challenge to their Israelism, and they aren't ready for it.

But as long as the conflict exists, that reality isn't going to change.

There are also numerous stories of Jewish students who try to participate in the student body being explicitly harassed for holding ""the incorrect view"" on Zionism, or Israel. 

So good on you for standing up, but to think this is ridiculous is missing the larger issue. An issue that is coming from *your side of the political aisle.* 

As I have said before, and I will reiterate:

Right-wing anti-Semitism is explicit and is almost universally condemned. Left-wing anti-Semitism is implicit and is usually welcomed because it is cloaked in emancipatory politics. A neo-Nazi bombs a synagogue and kills 5 people the world weeps with us. An anti-Zionist activist call for the destruction of the state of Israel and they are cheered.",2021-11-25T02:28:06+00:00

How? Because the hard left still run all the establishments in the country including the mishtarah. Also, I can guarantee you that if some leftist in Ramat Aviv had her cat stuck in a tree, the police and fire brigade would be there within a few minutes, poor Jews who are mostly traditional, right wing and religious in the ""mixed"" communities can for days be left at the mercy of rampaging jihadonazis shouting ""idbah al-Yahud"" and attacking Jews, firebombing their homes and burning Synagogues and the only people to come to protect them are the residents of Yitzhar and La Familia football supporter group. Then once even a small fightback occurs, these brave ""martyrs"" and ""redeemers of al-Aqsa"" cry to the whole world and become the victims.

It explicitly doesn’t. Boycotting and calling for divestment / sanctions are inherently non violent actions.

Are there folks in BDS who commit petty harassment? Sure, find a movement that doesn’t have those people. But the movement itself is explicitly non violent, I mean it’s literally in the name. 

I was harassed by folks in Hillel who posted my name along with others in the student center accusing me of being a terrorist. Do I go around pretending like Hillel is just one large violent harassment campaign? Of course not! But they seemed to think so about BDS…huge double standard

All the SJP leadership at my uni were Jewish. There were more Jewish students than Palestinians. It’s quite the opposite, BDS is very welcoming of Jewish folks.

IsraelPalestine,comment,Health insurance marketplace,hlzdcxj,Dry-Maximum-2161,,"> First off Palestinian need to establish themselves as reasonable subjects of the Israelis 

Israeli Arabs have already done so. Palestinians living in occupied territories can’t do this precisely because their goal is *not* to be Israeli subjects. Forcing them to be subjects of the Israelis not only denies them self-determination (sound familiar?) but also is quite literally what fascist empires do.

> Protest has to end at some point and become politics

I agree. Sadly Zionists don’t even want to acknowledge such protests, even going as far as to make blacklists for protesters like the Canary Mission. How do you expect politics to come from protests when Zionists dismiss them as antisemitic acts of terrorism? Zionists aren’t even open to *peaceful* protests- that’s why it hasn’t progressed into political negotiations.

> Secondly BDS promotes denormalization 

Does it really? It sounds like your definition of normalization is forcing all Palestinians to become Israeli subjects. That’s a very unreasonable demand.

> Third…BDS plays into the Palestinian narrative which denies the importance of Israel to Jews

BDS has no official stance on this. Sure some Palestinians deny this, but I think it’s an entirely separate issue  from what BDS aims to do which is focus on the *present-day* realities of Palestinian human rights.

You’re also completely missing the point, this narrative you speak of doesn’t deny it so much as point out that Palestinians literally living in the region at that time  had a far more legitimate claim than the millions of European Jews coming in whose ties can be tenuously traced back thousands of years ago. And it wouldn’t have even been a problem had they not declared a state without the local population’s consent and backing from the British colonizers. But I’m not one to over index on the past. Neither is BDS. And you shouldn’t either. 

But going back to my original point, i think BDS should be encouraged, because if Palestinians can’t get anywhere with *peaceful* resistance, then they are that much more likely to join Hamas. And even you can admit that BDS is far preferable as a form of resistance.",2021-11-25T02:09:05+00:00

No more than Pakistan was set up because of the Holocaust.

What happened after world war II was that the British empire and other empires finished splitting up with a took as being under their control after world war I.
It wasn't a gift to the Jews it was already in play like the rest of the other parts of the world.
It's really important to understand the history The revolts against the British in the 1920s were not called the Palestinian revolt they were called the Arab revolts. That's because under the Ottoman empire there were no Palestinians they were called Arabs and the others were called Jews in 1948 the UN called for two state solution an Arab state without a name so not called Palestine and the other state for Jews which by default would end up being Israel because it's the only country we've ever known as Jews under our own sovereignty.
The truth be told is that the concept of a Palestinian people only became a reality in 1963 at the Arab League and if you check the original charter for the Palestinian charter article number 24 in 1963 not 1968 it laid no claim to Gaza or West Bank because they were owned and run by Egypt and Jordan.
Does that mean that people who are Arab and Muslim don't deserve a place to live I'm not saying that.
What I'm saying is the history matters and understand that none of this was a feel bad for the Jews in 1948 and quite frankly the reason we ended up here with only a state of Israel and not an Arab state with whatever name next to it is in the history books too.",2023-10-24T14:40:45+00:00

IsraelPalestine,comment,healthcare,k68uet5,brxso,,"Let me help you understand: 

Trust me when I tell you if you began to peel back the layers you’ll find out that Arab citizens in Israel do not have the same kind access to schools as Israelis do. They do not have the same equal access to education that Israelis do. In some cases they are not allowed to attend the same schools and even for the very few that are — they are not treated the same by their school peers. Arabs cannot travel freely around the country as easily and as openly as Jews. Arabs are also not allowed to buy/sell property as freely and again this process makes it extremely difficult for them to live in Jerusalem. That’s if they are not pushed out first. Israeli national law also does not work in their favor whatsoever. 9/10 cases are usually lost if you were to bring a case to court as an Arab/Muslim.

Arabs are constantly monitored and looked down upon everywhere they go. Even if that means they’re an allowed to get married and practice their faith. Most of the times they are denounced when praying in public — and in Ramadan the holiest Muslim month they were received with tear gas at their place of worship at Masjid Al Aqsa — the third holiest mosque in the Muslim religion that the right-wing Israeli government wants to tear down and replace with what they think The Temple of the Mount should be.

While the Temple used to be there many thousands of years ago, Islam came after Judaism as another branch of religions of Abraham and the mosque was built there after the Temple was destroyed by the Roman Empire.

Israelis are essentially punishing Arabs for crimes they didn’t commit. That is against international law and is known as “collective punishment” and they have been doing this since the inception of the state of Israel in 1948. Punishing an ethnic/religious group for the crimes of one small terrorist group “Hamas”.

Hamas was not even formed until 1987 and was seen as a last resort — a form of resistance when anything resembling peace (see Oslo Accords) failed to see the light of day. Also, a couple of years back Palestinians tried to peacefully get corporations to support and implement the BDS movement (boycott, divestment and sanctions) aimed at driving business away from corporations that were actively funding Israel that allowed it to continue its war crimes. The BDS movement failed because no corporation was willing to stand in the face of “antisemitism”. However Palestinians just want equal rights. There is nothing antisemitic about equal opportunity, travel, healthcare, property and education for all.

Israel have one of the best militaries in the world, have access to some of the best nuclear weaponry in the world as well as medicine and tech. THAT is why this is genocide, Gazans don’t have clean water, fuel or electricity. Even war has rules and there’s always an oppressor and oppressed.

Think about why Israel is being painted as the victim in all Western media outlets when it has consistently reigned hellfire and terror on Palestinian civilians for 70+ years and displaced them out of their homes. Ask yourself why would a country suffering from terrorist attacks and radical Islam, receiving millions of dollars in aid and support from the USA have to advertise the attack on YouTube ads and Twitter ads to “raise awareness” while Gazan aid from Egypt and other Arab states is destroyed by Israeli military officials before it even reaches the Gaza border.

Also, Israel already has all major Western allies siding with it, so why the ads? Because they know public opinion + perception matters and they have always been known to be the aggressor that needs these minor attacks to happen to be able to retaliate and justify its genocidal actions. They want to convince the public it’s justified, it’s war and this is what war is like. Not true. Nyetnyahu is losing public support amongst Israelis and everyone knows public support rises when you are a “Wartime President”. I urge Americans to make parallels between him and Trump.

As this is not a religious or ethnic war as the media would have you believe. This is a humanitarian crisis full of international war crimes. This is not an equal fight and the war is very complex in terms of special interests and serving the US needs and wants in the region. Similar to that of Iraq and “weapons of mass destruction”. The Middle East is an oil mine and thus this is all strategic.

Secondly they don’t want every Jew dead…they want to live and for their children to live ….and then after that thats achieved they’d like a better  quality of life. 

It’s very easy not side with Isreal when their argument is. We have a right to defend ourselves. (Even at the cost of thousands of lives). It makes people think hold on…why is Isreal so special that it gets to get away with so much destruction just to “protect themselves”? Who would actually feel sorry for them. And people run on emotions not on : “civilians don’t matter when it comes to war”.  

Let me tell you something. And I know many Isrealis that have grown up in a Zionist household ( I am not saying you have). Pro Palestinian people see Isreali lives and Palestinian lives as equal which is why they’re saying enough to the bombing and loss of life. Isreal sees Palestinian lives as inferior. They see collateral as a necessary evil. Lives worth being wasted. This is a fact. 

Jews have had a horrible past, it has forced them to be savage and afraid. They point at anything coming out of Palestine and call it a lie or fake…”Hamas-led” that’s like calling every public building in the UK “conservative-led”. It doesn’t mean there’s a Hamas member sitting making calls telling people to lie about causality numbers. There is such an amas of evidence about the brutality of IDF soldiers, the lies of the army. Just why did the Isreali government arm settlers in the West Bank? Why were there illegal settlements in the West Bank to begin with (the local gov will literally hook up settlers to utilities…which were clearly recognised as illegal by the International Criminal Court…did Isreal care? No….they are above the ICC. They are above international law…”war crimes “ are acceptable when it comes poor Isreal… nothing applies to Isreal. Because of Jews horrible past they think it gives them a right to treat Palestinians like animals. This is something ingrained in their culture. Non Arabs and non Muslims have travelled to the West Bank and seen first hand how Palestinians are treated… I don’t know if this is some sort of psychological and generational trauma because of the war and the hunted have now become the hunter…and Isreal kills out of genuine fear that Jews might be wiped out again and so this is their extreme response under threat…. But would you stand back as someone raped a child just because they were raped as a child and got effed up from it…. No. What’s wrong or wrong and what’s right is right.

IsraelPalestine,comment,FDA,k8zvkwe,Hatrct,,"What I wanna know is why did Hamas kill civilians. It simply makes no sense. They had 2 options: A) infiltrate Israel, take 100s of hostages B) kill 1000+ civilians, take 100s of hostages

They chose B. Why would they do this? All this did was justify Israel and others labeling them as terrorists, and giving more power to Israel to justify an attack on Gaza.

If they did A, they would have humiliated Israel (for breaching the border so easily), had hostages that they could use to get concessions from Israel, and shown Israel to be the aggressor if Israel attacked Gaza or at least used too much force on Gaza.

Surely, they knew Israel would respond like this. Why did they do it? Well, I guess in the long run this will increase support for Hamas among Palestinians, and the in the long run would make Hamas stronger. But in the short term many Hamas fighters would die. So that would imply the Hamas fighters (not the leadership) are either stupid or they wanted to become martyrs. The bigger question is, why is Netanyahu doing something that will strengthen Hamas in the long run and increase attacks against Israel in the long run? No wonder so many moderate and sane and rational Israelis are against Netanyahu.

It is interesting, in Israel you can protest and speak against Netanyahu's anti-Israeli actions, but in the West you get censored. Bizarre. It would be like Americans inside US not liking Trump, but another country saying ""how dare you criticize Trump, you are racist against Americans. The Americans died in the civil war.

[This map of the State of Israel is set in a world where the British did not try to limit Jewish immigration to Palestine, thus the Mandate is majority Jewish by 1945.](https://preview.redd.it/2rwga3zjhoi41.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4e74a56d4e61200a193b116339630c971098321)

For nearly three decades, the so-called two-state solution has dominated discussions of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But the idea of two states for two peoples in the territory both occupy was always an illusion, and in recent years, reality has set in. The two-state solution is dead. And good riddance, it never offered a realistic path forward. The time has come for all interested parties to instead consider the only alternative with any chance of delivering a lasting peace; and that is a single unified Jewish and democratic state with equal rights for both Jews and non-Jews.

The idea of a one-state solution is already on the table in Arab and Israeli circles, and open to debate. Today it appears as the only workable alternative to the two-state solution, which has prevailed since the partition resolution of 1947. There is no sign of an implementation of the two-state solution on the horizon, and if it were attempted, it would resemble a surgical operation with a great deal of blood loss. Under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel has abandoned any pretence of seeking a two-state solution, and public support for the concept among Israelis has steadily dwindled. The younger generation is having a hard time connecting with or believing in the idea of a two-state solution.

Palestinian leaders continue to seek a separate state. But after years of failure and frustration, most Palestinians no longer see that path as viable. According to a new poll published Feb. 11 2019 by the Ramallah-based Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research (PSR), headed by Khalil Shikaki, support for a two-state solution among Palestinians stands at less than 40% for the first time since the signing of the Oslo Accord. About 61% of respondents no longer believe that a two-state solution is viable, given the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The simple truth is that over the decades, Israel has developed enough power and cultivated enough support from Washington to allow them to occupy and hold the territories and to create, in effect, a one-state reality of their own devising.

In addition to close security cooperation between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, a market for labor and other economic activities has resulted from the encroachment of 700,000 Jewish settlers into the Palestinian territories as well as the ongoing Judaification of Jerusalem. In short, there are twelve million people, half of whom are Palestinians and the other half Jews, who have been interacting for the past seven decades on this small stretch of land, in war and peace, in dispute and collaboration. In spite of the animosity, there is a kind of mutual dependency that cannot be ignored. In that space, the shekel is the primary currency of trade and commerce. The territories share a common taxation and customs system, and some 150,000 Palestinians commute to work in Israel every day. With time these new linkages have become incontrovertible.

So what is the ultimate solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict? The solution is an acceptance of the status quo. The solution is a one-state solution, a Jewish and democratic state with equal rights for both Jews and non-Jews. But how can this be achieved, given the current circumstances? Today I would like to offer a step by step guide on how Israel and the Jewish people can bring about this vision through simple and effective measures that will ensure the perpetuation and prosperity of the State of Israel and the Jewish people for generations to come.

**Step 1: Nullification of the Oslo Accords**

The State of Israel will officially decide and will then officially notify the Palestinian Authority and the Quartet (the U.S., the EU, the UN and Russia) of the full cancellation of the Oslo Accords and all its derivatives and the restoration of the legal situation in Judea, Samaria and Gaza as it was before the agreements.

**Step 2: Offer Honorable Withdrawal to all Terrorists**

To prevent bloodshed, Israel will make an offer to anyone in Judea, Samaria and Gaza who doesn't wish to fight against it, or continue to bear arms, or is not willing to live under full Israeli control, a dignified retreat, with his family, similar to the withdrawal of thousands of PLO terrorists from Beirut at the end of the first Lebanon War. After this agreed withdrawal, any person living in Judea, Samaria and Gaza who fights against Israel, with weapons or incitement or other prohibited activity, will be considered a terrorist. They will then be deported or imprisoned, and have their property seized and put up for sale or simply demolished. In the meantime, the IDF, the Shin Bet security service, and the rest of Israel's security and government agencies will complete their preparations for a complete Israeli return to all the territories of Judea, Samaria and Gaza.

**Step 3: Restoration of Israeli Military and Security Control Over the Entire Territory**

The IDF, with the assistance of the other security forces, will retake control of all of Judea, Samaria and Gaza. Israel will do everything in its power to reduce unnecessary violence against the Arab residents of Judea, Samaria and Gaza during and after the takeover, and to prevent humanitarian problems (water supply, etc.). In the takeover and its aftermath, all the terrorist elements that remain in the area will be destroyed, liquidated, expelled or imprisoned. All the terrorist installations will be destroyed and thorough searches for weapons, tunnels, incitement materials, etc. will be carried out. At the end of the operation, no sovereign or armed entity will remain between the Jordan River and the sea except for the State of Israel.

**Step 4: Application of Israeli Sovereignty**

Full Israeli sovereignty will be applied in all the redeemed territories in Israeli hands. Immediately after the security takeover, police stations and other symbols of Israeli sovereignty will be established in every city and village in Judea, Samaria and Gaza. Every Israeli citizen will be allowed to move freely in any public space. The Arab residents will receive a temporary Israeli resident card and will be able to choose their municipal leadership and pay their municipal taxes. Israel will not collect taxes from them and will not provide them with services other than security, as in any other place in Israel, and Israeli health services, which will be provided in exchange for full payment to all who require it.

**Step 5: Suggested Options for Individual Choice**

After the application of Israel's sovereignty and the restoration of personal security to residents in the entire area, every adult or family of Arab descent will be able to choose between three options: **Migration**, **Residency** or **Citizenship**. No one will be forced to decide immediately, and the possibility to choose will remain open to them:

**Emigration:** Over 60% of the Arabs living in Judea and Samaria have expressed their desire to emigrate. Approximately 20,000 of them do so annually. Israel will help by offering a generous migration package, as well as help find donor countries willing to absorb the migrants and resettle them.

**Permanent Residency:** After a period of time, the Arab residents will gradually be able to submit a request for status as permanent residents. Receipt of this status will be conditional on a declaration of open loyalty to the State of Israel and recognition of the State of Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people. The application will be examined, and those not involved in hostilities or intentional harm to the State will be entitled to permanent residency status. Permanent residents will be able to move freely and work throughout the country. All tax laws will apply to permanent residents. The only difference between them and ordinary citizens will be the duty of soldiering and the right to vote.

**Citizenship:** For those wishing to tie their fate to the Jewish people, prove their loyalty and finally receive full Israeli citizenship, a long-term track for Israeli citizenship will be established,  a track in which their suitability and loyalty will be examined over time. In addition to the declaration of loyalty, language tests, recommendations, etc., applicants to this track will be obligated to enlist in the army or national services.

**Step 6: Encouraging Aliyah To Maintain A Jewish Majority**

The resolution of the conflict over the Land of Israel and clear Israeli sovereignty over the entirety of the Land will pave the way for the permanent settlement development in the areas of Judea, Samaria and Gaza. The prospect of receiving land and building a home in the heart of Israel at an affordable price will greatly increase immigration and further accelerate Jewish settlement over the land. There will be no more ""illegal settlements"" as Israel will nullify the legal anomaly in which hundreds of thousands of Israelis have lived “outside Israel” for decades, under military control. Instead, much like how the map above illustrates, all of it will be naturally absorbed into the State of Israel.

The map is very misleading.

The problem with it is that the most hostile group to it, are those in power. And Israel is getting away with war crimes, for now at least, without having to micromanage Palestinians. Like in any occupation, oppression, or colonial activity, the outsourcing of management and control of oppressed populations to some of among themselves, is actually more efficient. I don't want to mention the classic extreme example of that, because everybody knows it. PA (and to lesser extent Hamas ) is actually maintaining a very apathetic population, and Israeli administrations find that unparalleled. Furthermore, giving rights to Palestinians is actually very costly. Israel can instead continue the static quo and get away with all the things that it wants from West Bank and Gaza, like natural resources, or even land to transfer its population to, with minimal consequences. So all and all, any realistic advocates of the 1SS, whether democratic Binational or current Israel, should turn on to convince Israeli Jews.

Denounce terrorism, give up their right to bear arms outside of public and military service. They must also be willing to wait a total of 10 years, before their citizenship application is approved. Now you tell me, what Palestinian would ever agree to such terms and conditions?",2020-02-23T20:45:30+00:00

Because if you mean ""a democratic one-state solution"", [the polls I've seen](https://pcpsr.org/en/node/731), show something quite different. 19% support among Israelis, 9% among Palestinians, 11% among Arab-Israelis.

And the political group that supports it the most, among both nations, are the Israeli right-wing. Indeed, OP's plan is a pretty mainstream Israeli far-right solution.",2020-02-23T16:43:26+00:00

IsraelPalestine,comment,unnecessary tests,fik1st7,finkej2,,"Step 1: The Oslo Accords are not optimal for Israel, but they are preferable to say the power structure of Gaza (Hamas). As Israel plans to annex more, the Accords become meaningless anyway.

Step 2: Israel will never allow this to happen. Israel has shown that it believes its security is the single most important policy matter. Do you think Israel would truly give “honorable withdrawal” to thousands of people who think Israel is a illegitimate state and want a state from the river to the sea? In this plan, Israel would be the state from the river to the sea.

Step 3: what this is is essentially full annexation of lands claimed by Palestine. Also, what this is is increased security presence in Palestinian areas from what it is now. That is not preferable for the Palestinians. Think historical US policing of people of color. This would be that but on steroids.

Step 4: sounding more and more like an ethnostate based on the Arab model.

Step 5: absolves Israel of all responsibility for displacement of Palestinians. I see Israel having to at least give some sort of reparation to those displaced in ‘48. Also, the emigration is beyond unfeasible. Where would they emigrate to? Is this not dissimilar to Arab countries installing policies that pushed out their Jews? Arab countries already have a problem with absorbing Palestinians into their society.

Step 6: the problem with this is that the vast majority of Jews who need Israel are already there. Since 1948, most European Jews and most MENA Jews have already left. 90% of Jews live in Israel, Canada, or the US. You’d need to convince American and Canadian jews to make aliyah to actually have an impact on maintaining a Jewish majority, especially if 1 or 2 million Palestinians decide to accept Israeli citizenship.

To be frank, I think this plan is naive. Israel has shown that the status quo is preferential to any other feasible possibility, at least under Netanyahu. Gantz is more progressive, but not when it comes to borders and security.",2020-02-23T15:11:13+00:00

In short, Israel would no longer remain an exclusively Jewish state, and its institutions would have to reflect that.

Any attempts to stall or prevent the enfranchisement of a population willing to be enfranchised would be transparently seen as excuses to artificially maintain Jewish dominance, and denounced as such. If Israel insisted to keep Arabs disenfranchised, Israel would rightly be labeled an apartheid regime.

This silly notion that Arabs would just pick up and leave their homeland for Israel to keep for Jews alone is nothing but a ridiculous rightwing pipe dream. There are only two ways Israel can keep both the whole Land of Israel and its Jewish character, and those are either apartheid or ethnic cleansing. In the end all rightwing ""creative"" alternatives to the two state solution boil down to one of them.",2020-02-23T22:20:19+00:00

You have also to consider how polls are conducted. So The poll you mentioned answered what people preferred, not what they can accept. Very different questions. 

Edit(addition): I prefer a two-state solution that does not segregate populations. But I can accept living as equals with Israeli Jews, in one state. Both solutions are better than not-completely-apartheid that we currently live in, or the complete one under trump plan.",2020-02-23T16:58:41+00:00
