Healthcare,post,1cr6of2,Tonitz,Waiting 2 weeks for Rx to be called in. Acceptable? Negligent? ,"I was referred by my ENT to a Lung & Sleep care Dr in February for a sleep study. I was told the earliest I could get an in-lab sleep study was in May. Three days before my May appt, I get a call saying they're cancelling my sleep study because my insurance didn't approve it. I ask why wasn't the pre-approval process done months earlier, and the lady laughed and said something along the lines of 'honey we're way too busy to be doing pre-approvals that far out.' 

They also prescribed me Modafinil to help with fatigue/lethargy. They sent it to my regular pharmacy on file. My insurance didn't cover it, and it ended up being way too expensive so I didn't get it filled. I then found out that I could use Good Rx and get it through a different pharmacy for much cheaper. On May 1st I called and left a voicemail for the nurse, and also messaged her through the patient portal asking to send it to a different pharmacy. I was very clear in my instructions. After a week of waiting, I got an update that my prescription had been sent in error to the original pharmacy. Since then I have been calling and messaging them every day to get this sorted out. Tomorrow will mark 2 weeks that I've been requesting it be sent to the new pharmacy. It's considered a controlled substance, so it can't be transferred from pharmacy to pharmacy. It needs to be called in directly by the Dr's office. I've only ever received one response by phone, and one response through the patient portal from them. Otherwise it's radio silent. I've also called my ENT's office since they referred me there, and let them know about the situation. I even asked if they could prescribe it for me. They said no, but that they also reached out to the Sleep office on my behalf and I still haven't heard back.   
  
The pre-approval failure is one thing, but waiting for a prescription to be called in for 2 weeks just seems negligent and ridiculous. Is there something I can do? Some regulatory board I can file a complaint with? Any other suggestions on what actions I can take? ",2024-05-13T18:34:38+00:00

Healthcare,comment,l3wuvmm,Tonitz,,"A plumber and homeowner's insurance is a horrible analogy.

Assuming we're talking about healthcare in the US, which is outrageously expensive, then you bet your ass it sounds rational.  Most people can't come up with the kind of money they're charging out of pocket. Our healthcare system would cease to exist as is if doctors and insurance companies didn't work hand in hand. If I got sent a check for $50k  after my initial diagnosis, and they said this is to fix your sleep apnea, I could avoid so many unnecessary steps that are required now with insurance. But healthcare providers would go out of business. There are people in most practices whose primary job is to deal directly with insurance companies. And yes, doing things like pre-approvals. I tried calling my insurer once and asking if a surgery was approved when I had just switched insurance companies. They wanted all sorts of specific procedure codes that only a Doc's office would have. I was told to just have the surgeons office call them directly. Ya know, like they always do. This is the way things work. A plumber doesn't have contacts at State Farm and Progressive. Doesn't care which one you have or if you have insurance at all. There's no 3 letter code for a clogged toilet. And he certainly isn't getting millions in kickbacks for using Milwaukee tools instead of DeWalt.

My prescription is actually for Armodafinil. My insurance doesn't cover that or any of the similar variants. But I did find I can get it fairly cheap using Good Rx. The only problem is it doesn't work at my normal pharmacy. Hence the reason I need it sent to a different pharmacy.",2024-05-13T23:41:16+00:00

I think most folks outside the healthcare field would say that's textbook negligence. 


The Sleep care office are the ones that pushed for me to do the lab study as opposed to the at home sleep study. And it's not that the procedure isn't covered by my insurance. It can be, depending on certain criteria. Otherwise they suggest an at home study. But it's not a simple yes or no, and I doubt they'd approve/reject based on simply me calling them.

Healthcare,post,1cr47n5,gonnafaceit2022,Is this the new standard in family medicine? ,"I've had a couple of wonderful primary docs in the past, but one retired and one moved away. I don't have a real PCP now but I go to the same clinic where I saw the doctor who moved away in the rare instances I need a doctor. It's a small town clinic with one DO and a PA. 

I booked an appointment to get established with the new doc and have a rash on my face checked out. (I'd seen the PA already and he blindly threw darts about the rash.) 

The doctor didn't ask me ANYTHING. This was an appointment to establish care. He didn't ask about my diet, lifestyle, alcohol use, health history, didn't even go over my med list (which was on file from before). He shrugged about the rash, prescripted Rx antibiotic cream and Rx topical steroids. That made it worse. I finally diagnosed it myself from the internet (it was perioral dermatitis) and figured out how to get rid of it on my own. But that's not even my gripe. 

That was about a year ago and I went in recently for blood pressure and allergy meds. There's a different new DO now. He didn't make eye contact once. He didn't ask me any questions or go over my (fairly long) med list (which hasn't been updated there in years). The nurse didn't go over any of it either. He sent the scripts (even though they had never been prescribed from that clinic before) no problem but what in the world?? 

I used to be asked some standard questions at the beginning of every visit, there was a depression screening and questions about feeling safe in your home. There's none of that now. 

I'd like to find a *good* primary doctor but I'm wondering if this is just standard now? I've heard people tell similar stories about different clinics. How likely is it to find a doctor who has any interest in you as a person? I have a wonderful relationship with my OBGYN and I wish she could be my primary doc but alas, she cannot.

Because they're not PCPs. 

It sounds to me like you're expecting a clinic doctor--who's not your PCP--to act like your PCP?

I'm not trying to be a dick. I'm ignorant of this stuff because I've had my same PCP for 15 years and I've never gone to a clinic.

Healthcare,comment,l3xgoge,OnlyInAmerica01,,"To answer your question directly, yes, this is likely the new ""standard"" for primary care.  About 15 years ago, Psychiatry was in a similar bind.  

Psychiatry is all about deep-diving and discussion of fears, perception, and how that affects our thoughts, emotions and actions.  It takes 4 additional years after medical school to learn these skills.

But by the mod 2000's, reimbursements by insurers had gotten so poor. That most practices devolved I to 10 minute ""med-management"" visits, and they did away with the entirety of talk therapy ( very tragic).

Then it hit a point where most psychiatrists simply left the insurance based model, and went to a cash-only.  And surprisingly, they thrived.

Today, > 50% of psychiatrists accept no insurance, and the ones that do have seen their reimbursements return to reasonable levels.  

I suspect that primary care will eventually be something like that, with PA'S and NP's providing the bulk of routine or algorithmic care.  

Because it's not that a physician can't provide much better care, it's that they can't do it in the time-frame that insurance will compensate for.",2024-05-14T00:00:09+00:00

The practice is called ""xx family medicine."" ""Clinic"" is what I would call a doctor's office that wasn't urgent care or a specialist. Does clinic mean something different to you? Maybe it's outdated, idk.

And by PCP, I mean the person I'd call ""my doctor."" The doctor who moved away was ""my doctor"" for any kind of general medicine stuff, and because the office/clinic is very close to my house and the next closest one is 30 minutes away, I've continued to go there when I need to (which, like I said, is rarely).

There is only one doctor there and the PA so it's safe to assume the doctor would be ""my doctor,"" hence requesting a new patient appointment. The face rash is what prompted me to make an appointment but since I'd never met him before, it was booked as a new patient appointment AND I had this rash. 

I would like to get a PCP, a doctor who knows more than my name and date of birth, and the reason I haven't is most of them are booking months away, if they're taking new patients at all, and since I don't typically need a doctor more than once a year or so, I haven't bothered to go through the process of becoming a new patient because it seems likely it'll be a similar experience, based on what I've heard. 🫤",2024-05-13T21:28:47+00:00

It was fine because I had a psychologist for therapy too, but the next psychiatrist I had was phenomenal. Our appointments were usually 30 minutes and she really got to know me over the years. She trusted me too, which I know is a big deal especially when someone is prescribing controlled substances. 

She left psychiatry all together a few years ago. I asked what she was going to do instead and she said, I'm not sure yet. 

I'd think medicine is something one plans to do forever, since it's such an investment. Leaving the field all together is pretty telling of the current situation.

And part of my confusion comes from urgent cares themselves. I remember when they first starting popping up. I thought to myself, ""Well, hopefully they'll take some of the strain off of emergency rooms."" But it doesn't seem like that's what's happening with them. It seems like people are using them almost as primary care in some ways--for example, if they're sick, instead of calling their PCP for an appointment, they go to urgent care. If they need a physical, they go to urgent care instead of their PCP. (Just a couple examples off the top of my head that I've heard people talking about in the past few months.)

Healthcare,comment,l3yjona,PseudoGerber,,"To clear this up (and there may be regional differences but this is how it works in my area):

Concierge: They *do* bill insurance, but you also have a monthly fee on top of that. This allows the doctor to have a smaller patient panel and give more time, attention, and availability to each patient.

Direct Primary Care: They *do not* bill insurance. Instead, they charge a monthly fee (usually higher than concierge would charge). These docs can have a smaller patient panel and therefore you get more time, attention, and availability. This is an especially good option if you have high deductible insurance, or if you want to prevent insurance companies from having a say in how your healthcare is delivered.

Healthcare,comment,l3vz7hw,HIPAA_University,,"Analytics all day. Unless you’re going into a healthcare specific MBA/finance program, with an MSF or MBA with finance focus, you’re better off going to Wall Street than a hospital. 

In healthcare the way you “increase profits” is by looking at your operations and seeing where you’re being inefficient and increase utilization, not necessarily an income statement or balance sheet. Reason being, is it’s very difficult to get an exact figure on accounts receivable because of how we reimburse for healthcare (a LOT more complicated than just that, but the gist). 

With an analytics focus, you’ll be able to get creative in what things you measure, and how you apply them from an operational efficiency perspective. Look into LEAN/6-Sigma, and that’ll give you an idea of what I mean. I think with a degree in molecular biology, you’ll be able to “speak the language” of docs/scientists and better understand what is feasible for those kinds of individuals. 

But the cool part, is with analytics and a passion for finance, you have the ability and skills to say “looking at this utilization data of our ED nurses, they’re at 61%, and we can get them to 77% by doing (x), which would indicate in my model that we could see (y) more patients, which would lead to (z) in revenue”

Healthcare,comment,l3m0acf,bhawks197,,"It’s possible it could be a billing / insurance issue. Sometimes things aren’t covered due to the way they’re billed or processed by insurance rather than the actual service. For example, 87801 is typically billed when multiple tests are run on the same date of service, and would take the place of billing for each test individually. I’d start by calling your insurance to ask why these labs weren’t covered to see if it’s a coding issue. Sometimes they’ll outreach your provider for you to work it out. My gut says this was billed incorrectly, but without knowing details of your insurance plan and state regs I couldn’t say for sure.

1. You're still paying a lot of money in monthly premiums  ""just in case"" of a major health event.  Because of various laws and regulations, this doesn't really scale with your own personal risk profile (the young and healthy will always be subsidizing the old or chronically sick).  

2.  There are complicated negotiations with insurers and medical offices, such that medical offices benefit from charging a high price for anything involving cash-pay.  This sets the ""tone"" for the negotiations.  They can also potentially write off the difference between what they ask and what's actually paid, in taxes.

Healthcare,comment,l3w36h3,Hour-Mall-8520,,"It looks to me like you've just had a fairly common experience for patients in the high-quality healthcare system with confusing payment policies of the US.

While some other comments suggest that your doctor ordered unnecessary tests, I prefer to think of it as your doctor being thorough.  All of the ordered tests were probably not necessary, but your doctor was checking everything and is not to blame.  You are fortunate to have such a good doctor.

The problem was that you apparently didn't ask how much the tests would cost or how much of the costs you would have to pay beforehand.  As a result, you were surprised by a big bill.

I live in a country with socialized medicine that covers all costs no matter what, though in practice this means that I and others often end up paying private doctors and labs for problems like yeast infections to avoid the long waits in the socialized system.  I also just went to a private doctor for a suspected yeast infection, and like your doctor, he ordered a bunch of tests.  I looked at the list of tests, knowing that I would pay for them, and asked, ""What's the most likely that we should do first?""  In the end, I got out of there for around $200 and think we have the problem taken care of, though I have a long list of other tests and procedures to try in sequence if this initial approach doesn't work.

Unfortunately, the US system is so hierarchical and confusing that it's hard to make these kinds of consumer decisions as a patient.  The doctors just do what they want, and then the insurance companies do what they want.  The patient is left out of it until it comes time to pay.

But because you are the one who will be stuck with the bill in the end, you have to be assertive early on and ask things like, ""How much will this cost me and can we try something cheaper first?""

I like your doctor--very thorough--but you probably need to raise the cost issue with her up front.  $500 isn't a lot to lose to learn this lesson.  Good luck.",2024-05-13T19:00:23+00:00

For people on Medicare advantage plans I’d just advising reading your plan documents carefully to understand when a prior authorization is needed, under what conditions the service would be covered, and communicating with both the insurance carrier and provider about the status of it.

If the facility is out of network you can submit an appeal. If your child’s pediatrician referred you to that facility state that in the appeal and they will overturn it for plan directed care.

Healthcare,post,1co610j,Wolf-en-stein,Can I request a reimbursement from Medi-Cal for an emergency dental filling at a non-participating dentist?,"Hi, all. 

So my partner doesn't have an official dentist yet because he hasn't seen a PCP to be referred (their wait times are 3+ months for an initial exam, but he technically has Medi-Cal). Yesterday his front tooth chipped quite badly (almost in half) and he was experiencing 3/10 pain. It looked and felt horrible to him. I took him to a dentist who doesn't accept Medi-Cal but was able to fit him in before closing and paid $460 out of pocket for them to repair his tooth. 

I'm wondering, just out of curiosity - would Medi-Cal be able to reimburse him (me) for the service? I believe chipped teeth are something they cover, and as he wasn't a patient at a participating dentist, he had nowhere to go when his tooth chipped except an emergency dentist.

Wondering what our options are? Thanks in advance for your responses.",2024-05-09T19:43:30+00:00

Healthcare,post,1cnnzck,heretolearnlady,"Thoughts on connecting patient portal health records across multiple charts (Corewell, Trinity, etc.)?","I noticed  many of the US healthcare entities have an option to connect all of your health records so that each entity can see the records all in one place.  Does anyone choose to do this? What are your thoughts on it?

I think it could be beneficial and life-saving to have accessible records across multiple entities in an emergency event. I also have the perspective that if I want a second opinion for anything, it seems it has the potential to be harder to receive if that second opinion has access to all linked notes and records.

My reason for thinking this is because there is something to the patient being able to convey their feelings on what's going on as well without the notes of preceding appointments if those appointments didn't feel like they were on the right track.

I have recognized there are a lot of doctors that will read the notes first instead of giving their impression. I see pros and cons to this. It really depends on the doctor, I know there are doctors that don't let the notes completely dictate their perspectives or impressions, but its going to be likely that an impression can be made from the preceding notes, but could an impression be made more accurate sometimes without the preceding notes and just the doctor's mind at work?

As a counterpoint, I would say that all that background information can be essential for a person giving a second opinion to come to the right conclusion. In some cases, if someone has been followed over time for a problem, the initial provider may only be looking at each visit in the context of that visit rather than looking at the totality of the patient's history. Unfortunately, the majority of patients have a pretty bad memory for timelines, changes in symptoms, and even medication names and doses. Being able to see all of the historical information at once can be really helpful when giving a second opinion. 

In the vast majority of cases, it also decreases costs and time needed to achieve a proper second opinion. 

I think a lot of patients don't realize that to a certain extent medical diagnosis operates like a dichotomy key. When someone comes in with a particular cluster of signs, symptoms, and maybe preliminary lab findings, we first think about the most likely diagnosis and the most dangerous diagnosis. Then we do the next step in testing to rule in or out those things. Once we see how that works, we move on to the next step, and continue this cycle until we get to the right answer.

If a new patient comes to me and I don't have their history, I have to start back at the beginning, probably repeating the same tests and trying the same therapies that someone else has done without realizing those potential diagnoses have already been crossed off the list. 

I work at a major University hospital, so a lot of the patients I see come to me for a second opinion because we are more familiar with the rare stuff. But honestly, in the majority of cases, the first doctor would have gotten to the right answer with more time. The initial doctor has already worked through all of the lower level stuff and all it took was the next round of testing to find the correct answer. Oftentimes it's clear from the notes that this would have been the next step that the initial doctor would have taken, but the patient came to me before their doctor had a chance to take the next step. So I order the next round of testing, get to the answer, and look like a hero because I got the answer so quickly while the other doctor had been seeing the patient for years without coming to that conclusion. But in reality, I would have done everything the same way as the initial doctor, and the only way I was able to reach the right conclusion was by reviewing all of the previous steps the initial doctor had taken.",2024-05-09T14:24:00+00:00

Healthcare,comment,l38gn15,Pharmadeehero,,"The question is too vague to provide a well thought out response.

Universal healthcare system can mean many different things and no two systems around the world are identical.

There’s universal coverage/access

There’s universal single payer (also in many different flavors depending on different buyer/seller relationships)

There’s universal through the context of something like the NHS where even the care delivery is nationalized.

There’s also a fundamental question around what you define as in or not in as your definition of healthcare. Does it include all prescription drugs, dental? Vision? Long term care? Medical equipment? Ambulances? Etc. etc. etc.

The US healthcare system is a current bohemeth of an economic engine. It’s a significant part of GDP and healthcare benefits are nearly ubiquitous with employer benefits/total compensation of workers. Prices of almost any if not all, products and services (not just healthcare ones) include a component that pays for the overhead to provide health benefits to their employees and to pay employee salaries which then feed into Medicare taxes. Salaries go down or number of people with salaries go down  and Medicare rate tax stays the same… Medicare is brining in less tax money for their program.

The extreme details matter. It’s the very tiny hidden ill incentive that’s buried somewhere that can disrupt the entire motive and make things completely different than intended… see the ACA and implementation of a capped  minimum MLR. Thought was if we can limit their profit margins healthcare must get cheaper… well they kept the same or worse margins they just liked seeing increasing costs because that still meant that their profit dollars would keep increasing.",2024-05-09T03:45:41+00:00

US also has fewer drug supply shortage, if there is a drug shortage in the US then more than likely that shortage is 10x worse in a universal health care system. Yes access can be difficult, but if you aren’t cheap and value your life, you will find better healthcare here than anywhere else. 

All these other universal healthcare systems are trash:

Canada - you will wait in line for hours just register for a GP and there is no outpatient drug coverage.

NHS of England - workers go on strike more than they do here in the US. Absolutely no social care system, they’ll treat you in the hospital, albeit probably after waiting 6 months to get that appointment, but afterwards there will be little support from social care of you need it.

If you start though with the more narrow definition of our ""care"" system, It's difficult to tie drug (SMD & Bios + Devices) innovation specifically to the machinations of our ""care"" system. So much funding that generates next gen meds comes from government sources that flow into universities (private and public)---who then also can own and spin out startups from any innovations generated in their labs.

(But the secondary and tertiary effects would be great dissertation fodder)

Maybe there is a more direct link to the training, in that our teaching hospitals have a lot of money because of the extreme dollar flows, but they also get hurt by the big-money-game, paying ridiculous prices for basic supplies like exam room paper all the way up to high tech imaging devices; huge costs for admin, billing staff (3rd party subscriptions to help billing), and a standing legion of lawyers.

Health outcome 1a/1b: infant/maternal mortality 

> The infant mortality rate among White US citizens in the 5% highest-income counties was 4.01 per 1000, and the maternal mortality rate among White US citizens in the 5% highest-income counties was 10.85 per 100 000, both higher than the mean rates for any of the 12 comparison countries.

> The 5-year survival rate for White US citizens in the 5% highest-income counties was 67.2% (95% CI, 66.7%-67.7%) for colon cancer, higher than that of average US citizens (64.9% [95% CI, 64.7%-65.1%]) and average citizens in 6 countries, comparable with that of average citizens in 4 countries, and lower than that of average citizens for 2 countries.

Summary: rich US beat 6, about the same for 4 and only lost to 2… and don’t give me rebuttal about “average citizens” in the other countries… you can’t have it both ways…

Health outcomes 3: womens breast cancer

> The 5-year survival rate for breast cancer among White US women in the 5% highest-income US counties was 92.0% (95% CI, 91.6%-92.4%), higher than in all 12 comparison countries.

Summary: US won across the board here. Note: US beat the comparison companies when not even isolating to the counties making the top 5%.

Health outcome 4: ALL

> The 5-year survival rate for White children with acute lymphocytic leukemia in the 5% highest-income US counties was 92.6% (95% CI, 90.7%-94.2%), exceeding the mean survival rate for only 1 country and comparable with the mean survival rates in 11 countries.

Summary: US beat one country, on par (not better BUT ALSO NOT WORSE) with the other countries. Also note: conviently they didn’t report colon cancer, breast cancer nor ALL  survival rates for the of top 1% like they did infant/maternal mortality 

Health outcome 5: acute MI case mortality

> The adjusted 30-day acute myocardial infarction case-fatality rate for White US citizens in the 5% highest-income US counties was 8% below the rate for all US citizens and was 5% below the rate for all US citizens in the 1% highest-income US counties; these estimates were similar to the median outcome of other high-income countries.

Summary: weirdness in income rates vs Gen pop but this weirdness also is seen in other countries and the US is on par with those

TL;DR: your closing statement of “these findings imply..” is completely disingenuous. 1 maybe 1.5 of your outcomes showed the rich US lagged behind other countries. Rich US beat or was on par with all the rest. So no they wouldn’t “lag behind others in other countries”

Cut out payments to hospitals and doctors offices and make those $0 … I believe the US bar would then be smaller. 

Oh those payments go to more than just doctors and nurses? Ya no shit because there are way more types of healthcare workers than just doctors and nurses and yes paid management is required and exists in every country.

Yes the US also pays more on prescription drugs in total… but when they also have higher utilization of prescription drugs… you can easily spend more as a nation while they are cheaper for an individual at the same time.

>Salaries aren’t the big problem 

Yes. Yes indeed they are. The biggest benefit from universal payer is literally the strongest leverage possible to not have to pay as much as those that don’t have as strong leverage. No you don’t need universal payer to give access to everyone of some form of healthcare benefits.

I also challenge you to take the annual profits of all the big for profit healthcare related companies… sum them all up… it will be a tiny drop in total us expenses. That’s because profits don’t include all the high salaries and expenses paid to others. A company bringing in 400 billion in revenue and making a profit of 2 billion is either paying their people a ton or has a high cost of goods and paying another company who is paying their people good.

Whenever people want to talk about it being the for profit element driving the cost… no one ever breaks out the numbers.

The US utilizes more expensive services relative to cheaper ones (exception prescription drugs) higher than other countries and the us, although there’s much commentary on not every has coverage, also utilizes just generally more.

That's the difference accounting for differences in maternal mortality. Why would you ignore it? 

> #**Accounting for differential reporting methods, U.S. infant mortality remains higher than in comparable countries**

>When countries have different methods for reporting infant deaths, it is primarily a matter of how they report deaths among infants with very low odds of survival. According to the OECD, the United States and Canada register a higher proportion of deaths among infants weighing under 500g, which inflates the infant mortality rate of these countries relative to several European countries that count infant deaths as those with a minimum gestation age of 22 weeks or a birth weight threshold of 500g.

> Our analysis of available OECD data for the U.S. and some similarly large and wealthy countries finds that **when infant mortality is adjusted to include only those infant deaths that meet a minimum threshold of 22 weeks gestation or 500g in birth weight, the U.S. infant mortality rate is still higher than the average for those comparable countries with available data (4.9 vs 2.9 deaths per 1,000 live births).** Without adjusting for data differences, the U.S. infant mortality rate appears to be 84 percent higher than the average for the same set of comparable countries. (Note that this comparison was limited to 2016 data and could not include data for Australia, Canada, and Germany, which are included in the previous chart’s comparable country average for 2017.)

https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/infant-mortality-u-s-compare-countries/

Or this article... 

>Methods—Infant mortality and preterm birth data are compared between the United States and European countries. The percent contribution of the two factors to infant mortality differences is **computed using the Kitagawa method,** with Sweden as the reference country. Results—In 2010, the U.S. infant mortality rate was 6.1 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, and the United States ranked 26th in infant mortality among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. After excluding births at less than 24 weeks of gestation to ensure international comparability, **the U.S. infant mortality rate was 4.2, still higher than for most European countries and about twice the rates for Finland, Sweden, and Denmark.**

> The United States compares favorably with most European countries in the survival of very preterm infants. However, the comparison becomes less favorable as gestational age increases. For example, the U.S. infant mortality rate at 37 weeks of gestation or more was highest among the countries studied, and about twice the rates for Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. This study found that 39% of the United States’ higher infant mortality rate, when compared with that of Sweden, was due to the higher U.S. percentage of preterm births, while 47% of the difference was due to the United States’ higher infant mortality rate for infants at 37 weeks of gestation or more. A previous report found a larger effect for preterm birth (10), mostly due to the inclusion of births at 22–23 weeks of gestation in that report. Recent declines in the U.S. infant
mortality rate and percentage of preterm births, and the use of the obstetric estimate to measure gestational age in the current report (compared with gestational age based on the last menstrual period used in the previous report), may have also contributed to the difference in findings between the two reports.

>The findings from the current analysis suggest that declines in either the percentage of preterm births or in infant mortality rates at 37 weeks of gestation or more could have a substantial positive impact on the U.S. infant mortality rate. If both of these factors could be reduced to Sweden’s levels, the U.S. infant mortality rate (excluding events at less than 24 weeks) would be reduced from 4.2 to 2.4—a decline of 43%. **Such a decline would mean nearly 7,300 fewer infant deaths** than actually occurred in the United States in 2010.

[Comparing Health Outcomes of Privileged US Citizens With Those of Average Residents of Other Developed Countries](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2774561)

>These findings imply that even if all US citizens experienced the same health outcomes enjoyed by privileged White US citizens, US health indicators would still lag behind those in many other countries.

When asked about their healthcare system as a whole the US system ranked dead last of 11 countries, with only 19.5% of people saying the system works relatively well and only needs minor changes. The average in the other countries is 46.9% saying the same. Canada ranked 9th with 34.5% saying the system works relatively well. The UK ranks fifth, with 44.5%. Australia ranked 6th at 44.4%. The best was Germany at 59.8%.

On rating the overall quality of care in the US, Americans again ranked dead last, with only 25.6% ranking it excellent or very good. The average was 50.8%. Canada ranked 9th with 45.1%. The UK ranked 2nd, at 63.4%. Australia was 3rd at 59.4%. The best was Switzerland at 65.5%.

https://www.cihi.ca/en/commonwealth-fund-survey-2016

The US has 43 hospitals in the top 200 globally; one for every 7,633,477 people in the US. That's good enough for a ranking of 20th on the list of top 200 hospitals per capita, and significantly lower than the average of one for every 3,830,114 for other countries in the top 25 on spending with populations above 5 million. The best is Switzerland at one for every 1.2 million people. In fact the US only beats one country on this list; the UK at one for every 9.5 million people.

If you want to do the full list of 2,000 instead it's 334, or one for every 982,753 people; good enough for 21st. Again far below the average in peer countries of 527,236. The best is Austria, at one for every 306,106 people.

And before anyone mentions charity programs, there are not enough, they are not accessible to everyone, not everyone is eligible.   Like trying to tape bandaids together to cover a wound.

If you are middle-class and not very wealthy, you can get the same care as other countries for more per person. 

Only the very wealthy are able to access the prime, cutting-edge care, because insurance is likely to balk at plenty of proven treatments in favor of demanding you take older, cheaper options.  Forget experimental.

Healthcare,comment,l37yz7s,Pharmadeehero,,"While some of your facts and figures are certainly correct on face value I think it’s important to contextualize many things…

Evaluating raw epidemiology figures such as life expectancy and putting a causal relationship of these figures directly and solely on the quality and performance of a nations health system is completely inappropriate.

For example… let’s use one of your own sources 

>[exhibit A](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/quality-u-s-healthcare-system-compare-countries/#item-percent-used-emergency-department-for-condition-that-could-have-been-treated-by-a-regular-doctor-2016)

> Children and teens in the U.S. are less likely to make it to adulthood than in peer countries, with the U.S having higher rates of motor vehicle accidents, firearm deaths, and suicide deaths among children and teens. 

So life expectancy of the Us population is pulled down due to increased child and teen death due to MVA, firearm deaths and suicide. While I will be better than you and give you goodwill (which I doubt you will give me any) and say suicide could be partially influenced by mental health care … MVA’s and firearm deaths leading to premature death have NO RELATION to the quality of the healthcare system.


Extending that thought… we shouldn’t guage the quality of the health system based on outcomes when all of the different countries have different inputs. Societal, cultural, socioeconomic, skews in certain genetic predispositions will vary all to some degree, some a very large degree by country.

We shouldn’t dismiss or question the accuracy of many, if not all of the figures you present, but we should be honest with the world that someone playing a game on easy mode that gets a higher score than someone playing on diabolical doesn’t make the person playing on easy a better player than that of the one playing on diabolical.

I think hopefully everyone will agree that 

> Many chronic conditions are preventable, by modifying major risk factors such as smoking, alcohol use, obesity and physical inactivity.

[source](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/908b2da3-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/908b2da3-en)


The fact that an individual smokes, drinks, is obese, and/or is physically inactive is not a failure of the healthcare system. Or more precisely… shouldn’t be considered a failure of a healthcare system when talking endpoints of *treatment*.

Does it represent issues/problems of society that could be influenced by policy/education, sure. But I don’t see any metrics you have that for instance talks about one country vs another on how successful their healthcare workers on getting someone to quit smoking that shows up and seeks treatment to quit smoking.

I think many also likely agree that lower socioeconomic status may be associated with higher risk of chronic disease.

> Socio-economic disparities are also large: on average across OECD countries, 43% of people in the lowest income quintile report a longstanding illness or health problem compared with 26% of people in the highest income quintile
>[source](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/908b2da3-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/908b2da3-en)

The skew of income distribution and wealth inequality is also something that should not be unfairly be distorting the performance of the health system. The health system is not responsible and also should not try to be responsible for wealth and education disparities. NOTE: I’m not advocating for dismissing the importance or significance of these issues… just that they are separate issues that certainly impact people as well as their long term mortality and morbidity but their relative risk factors because of these things is something not all health systems have to be exposed to at all the same degree of risk.

Take a look at [this chart](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/908b2da3-en/images/images/03-chapter3/media/image17.png) ([pulled from here](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/908b2da3-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/908b2da3-en)on age standardized diabetes rates by country.  Please correct me if I’m incorrect… but I don’t think any of the stats or figures especially those from commonwealth which has been a lobbying group for socialized medicine for almost, if not an entire or more, century include comparison to the three countries higher than the US in diabetes rates.

Type 1 diabetes, which is widely believed to be caused by genes and/or genetic factors 

And type 2 diabetes of which the major cause is being overweight, obesity and physical inactivity…

So the causes of why people may get type 1 or type 2 diabetes (which sidebar is an expensive condition to treat.. and even if you want to talk about drug prices which please let’s… I’m ready to talk about the drugs in 90% of prescriptions aka generics are actually cheaper in the US than overseas .. about 80% of the cost here bs oversees) is not a function on the performance of the health system… rather the genetics, environmental, social/lifestyle choices of the individual… which we’ve already established puts them at higher risk of worsened morbidity and mortality performance.

When you have a population that has guns and shoots themselves/others… more people making poor lifestyle decisions… other social policy factors and/or cultural “norms” (agnostic of if these are “good” or “bad”) such as attitudes and beliefs towards alcohol in the US vs abroad… you **should expect** performance of all the “outcomes” you listed to be worse across the board if every country had the same exact health system. And that’s because the baseline risk and/or difficulty is much harder.

The us healthcare system isn’t responsible for the rates of single parent households .. [but the us is pretty bad, if not the worst in the world](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/12/12/u-s-children-more-likely-than-children-in-other-countries-to-live-with-just-one-parent/)

Here’s a whole ton of info on the relative risk of coming from a single parent vs two parent household: https://www.aecf.org/blog/child-well-being-in-single-parent-families

Do I like these facts about the population of the US? No of course not. Do I wish these things would improve? yes of course so. Do I believe we should advocate for policy and investments to improve many of these things? Yes absolutely.

Do I believe that because the state of the state is what it is that we should turn a blind eye to these realities that are beyond the causality of the healthcare system yet significantly impact the inputs and in turn outputs of the healthcare system and say all those outcome measures are purely a function of how “good” or “cost-efficient” a given health system is? #absolutely not

It’s funny you say that because insurance wasn’t awful as far as copay and coinsurance. Being uninsured was horrible though because everything was expensive and pre-existing conditions were going to be a barrier for future care. I was uninsured for that time and I did price health insurance on my own and I never could afford it. I remember a pharmacist complaining to me around 2005 or 6 that he had a lot of patients with $7,000 deductibles. At that point, if you’re healthy, why bother with paying premiums? It’s like catastrophic coverage only. 

A lot of the history blurs for me on health insurance and deductibles, but I do remember the reason was the company wanted to mildly disincentivize going for care. I’m not sure when exactly the deductibles got so crazy though. Some people still go to the ER for every bump, fart, or cold, sometimes regardless of the cost. Some people delay getting care even when it is life and death, and they end up needing a lot of resources. 

I am not sure the impact the Affordable Care Act had on cost containment in relation to inflation and all. It was not the bill that was intended unfortunately. I think the health insurance provider and PBM lobby is too per$ua$ive for anything to actually be done to help until we reach a tipping point. When will that be? I wonder.",2024-05-09T22:10:08+00:00

In fact, free healthcare was part of a plan for post-war reconstruction that had been envisioned while bombs were still falling in 1942.

One of the guiding principles of that plan was;

>""Proposals for the future should not be limited by ""sectional interests"". A ""revolutionary moment in the world's history is a time for revolutions, not for patching"".

Imagine being that forward-thinking. And they were serious about challenging entrenched interests. A book about this noted ""the heroic efforts of Bevan to create the beloved NHS - in the teeth, the book notes, of the opposition of the medical profession.""

https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/7207267

The Beveridge plan described disease (meaning lack of access to healthcare)  as one of the ""5 giant evils"" that must be tackled in order for Britain to flourish again.

>Beveridge was no socialist. He thought taking the burden of healthcare and pension costs away from corporations and individuals and giving them to the government would increase the competitiveness of British industry while producing healthier, wealthier, more motivated and more productive workers keen to buy British goods.

Healthcare,comment,l3e94mp,Conscious_Phone_4639,,"Americans face challenges in achieving a healthcare system similar to those in other countries due to several factors:

1. **Historical Context**: Unlike many other developed nations, the US has a long-standing tradition of private healthcare delivery and a decentralized healthcare system. Transitioning to a different model would require significant structural and cultural changes.
2. **Political Divide**: Healthcare reform is a deeply polarizing issue in American politics. Debates over the role of government, the balance between public and private healthcare, and how to fund universal coverage have hindered efforts to implement comprehensive reforms.
3. **Powerful Interest Groups**: The US healthcare industry is comprised of powerful interest groups, including pharmaceutical companies, insurance providers, and healthcare providers, which may resist reforms that could threaten their profits or influence.
4. **Lack of Consensus**: There is no consensus among Americans on the best approach to healthcare reform. While some advocate for a single-payer system or universal healthcare, others prefer maintaining a market-based system with minimal government intervention.
5. **Complexity of the System**: The US healthcare system is highly complex, involving multiple payers, providers, and regulatory agencies. Simplifying and streamlining the system to achieve universal coverage would be a daunting task.

Despite these challenges, there are ongoing efforts to improve the US healthcare system and address issues of access, affordability, and quality of care. By exploring innovative solutions, promoting collaboration across stakeholders, and learning from global best practices, Americans can work towards a healthcare system that meets the needs of all citizens.

With government in the US covering [65.7% of all health care](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/epdf/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302997) costs ($12,555 as of 2022) that's $8,249 per person per year in taxes towards health care. The next closest is Germany at [$6,930](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm). The UK is $4,479. Canada is $4,506. Australia is $4,603. That means over a lifetime Americans are paying over $100,000 more in taxes compared to any other country towards health care. 

> and they don’t like being told what to do like other people.

I think it's easy to argue Americans have less choice than other first world countries.

Americans pay an average of $8,249 in taxes towards healthcare. No choice in that. Then most have employer provided health insurance which averages [$8,435 for single coverage and $23,968 for family coverage](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/report/2023-employer-health-benefits-survey/); little to no choice there without abandoning employer subsidies and paying the entire amount yourself. Furthermore these plans usually have significant limitations on where you can be seen. Need to actually go to the doctor? No choice but to pay high deductibles, copays, and other out of pocket expenses.



On the other hand, take a Brit. They pay $4,479 average in taxes towards healthcare. He has the choice of deciding that is enough; unlike Americans who will likely have no coverage for the higher taxes they pay. But if he's not satisfied there are a wide variety of supplemental insurance programs. The average family plan runs [$1,868 per year](https://boughtbymany.com/news/article/private-health-insurance-cost-uk/), so it's quite affordable, and can give the freedom to see practically any doctor (public or private) with practically zero out of pocket costs.

So you tell me... who has more meaningful choices?

The US ranks 6th of 11 out of Commonwealth Fund countries on ER wait times on percentage served under 4 hours. 10th of 11 on getting weekend and evening care without going to the ER. 5th of 11 for countries able to make a same or next day doctors/nurse appointment when they're sick.

https://www.cihi.ca/en/commonwealth-fund-survey-2016

Americans do better on wait times for specialists (ranking 3rd for wait times under four weeks), and surgeries (ranking 3rd for wait times under four months), but that ignores three important factors:

* Wait times in universal healthcare are based on urgency, so while you might wait for an elective hip replacement surgery you're going to get surgery for that life threatening illness quickly. 

* Nearly every universal healthcare country has strong private options and supplemental private insurance. That means that if there is a wait you're not happy about you have options that still work out significantly cheaper than US care, which is a win/win.

* [One third of US families](https://news.gallup.com/poll/269138/americans-delaying-medical-treatment-due-cost.aspx?utm_source=alert&utm_medium=email&utm_content=morelink&utm_campaign=syndication) had to put off healthcare due to the cost last year. That means more Americans are waiting for care than any other wealthy country on earth.

>These findings imply that even if all US citizens experienced the same health outcomes enjoyed by privileged White US citizens, US health indicators would still lag behind those in many other countries.

When asked about their healthcare system as a whole the US system ranked dead last of 11 countries, with only 19.5% of people saying the system works relatively well and only needs minor changes. The average in the other countries is 46.9% saying the same. Canada ranked 9th with 34.5% saying the system works relatively well. The UK ranks fifth, with 44.5%. Australia ranked 6th at 44.4%. The best was Germany at 59.8%.

On rating the overall quality of care in the US, Americans again ranked dead last, with only 25.6% ranking it excellent or very good. The average was 50.8%. Canada ranked 9th with 45.1%. The UK ranked 2nd, at 63.4%. Australia was 3rd at 59.4%. The best was Switzerland at 65.5%.

https://www.cihi.ca/en/commonwealth-fund-survey-2016

The US has 43 hospitals in the top 200 globally; one for every 7,633,477 people in the US. That's good enough for a ranking of 20th on the list of top 200 hospitals per capita, and significantly lower than the average of one for every 3,830,114 for other countries in the top 25 on spending with populations above 5 million. The best is Switzerland at one for every 1.2 million people. In fact the US only beats one country on this list; the UK at one for every 9.5 million people.

If you want to do the full list of 2,000 instead it's 334, or one for every 982,753 people; good enough for 21st. Again far below the average in peer countries of 527,236. The best is Austria, at one for every 306,106 people.

#Satisfaction with the US healthcare system varies by insurance type

78% -- Military/VA  
77% -- Medicare

65% -- Plan fully paid for by you or a family member

VA healthcare is a terrible parallel to universal healthcare proposed in the US. Nobody is talking about nationalizing providers. Care would still be provided by the same private doctors and hospitals as today, making Medicare and Medicaid far better examples. Of course, it's harder to fearmonger against systems people know and love, so it's clear why people bring it up. Of course, even as propaganda the argument is questionable. The VA isn't perfect, but it's not the unredeamable shitshow opponents suggest either.

>The poll of 800 veterans, conducted jointly by a Republican-backed firm and a Democratic-backed one, found that almost two-thirds of survey respondents oppose plans to replace VA health care with a voucher system, an idea backed by some Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates.

>""There is a lot of debate about 'choice' in veterans care, but when presented with the details of what 'choice' means, veterans reject it,"" Eaton said. ""They overwhelmingly believe that the private system will not give them the quality of care they and veterans like them deserve.""

>According to an independent Dartmouth study recently published this week in Annals of Internal Medicine, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals outperform private hospitals in most health care markets throughout the country.

Healthcare,comment,l385is1,nov_284,,"Military and VA *definitely* deserve to be separated. Military healthcare, like, as provided by active duty members in a government facility is pretty fantastic at trauma related injuries. They’re not as hot at other things, mainly because they don’t deal with them as much, but their approach to trauma medicine is “what works?” Everything else is a distant second at best. Likewise, active duty health insurance, Tricare, is pretty awesome. 10/10 highly recommend, especially for the out of pocket. More than the pension, I really kinda wish I’d done 20 just so I could have the Tricare. Just to be clear, I have never, and I mean never, heard someone disparage Tricare for the service they provide. It’s amazing. 

*VA* medicine, however, is shit. I can go to the VA for anything, for free, for ever. No copays, no deductibles, no means testing, no premiums, none of it. It’s so good that I sent the VA a letter declining further care and cancelling my enrollment. I accepted an $8/hr pay cut, something like 30% of my hourly pay, just to take a night shift job that offers health insurance. My family gets pretty good care from the VA; they get CHAMPVA, which is the best model for VA care going forward, in my opinion. I’d trade access to the VHA for a stale corn chip and the last swig from your stale off brand diet soda. I’ve met like, two people in my life who definitely have the means to go to a real doctor in an actual hospital who still choose the VA. One of them works for the VA, and the other one is an idiot and still would be if he took advantage of his insurance to go to a real doctor. If you gave all of the people I know who like the care they get from the VA a revolver and all of the people I know who have been hurt by VA medicine clubs and told them to fight to the death, I’d be willing to bet on the clubs, geriatrics and all. 

The reason I bring up the VA is that Medicare persistently underpays for some things, and I worry that without private insurance to carry the shifted costs we’d lose capacity to provide care. Back when they inflicted Obamacare on us instead of just going single payer they made a lot of fuss about cost shifting, but something like 90% of the costs that were being shifted were from government programs like Medicare. With the shit show that is our current medical training system, it wouldn’t take a lot of loss, as a percentage, to be catastrophic and our politicians love a good crisis. It’s an opportunity for them to inflict something that normally wouldn’t be tolerated. I’m more than a little afraid that if a medicare for all scheme wasn’t working effectively they’d install something that looks like ‘VA for all’ and I would absolutely not want that. I realize there’s a lot of propaganda about how amazing the VA is, but I’m here to say, it’s just that: propaganda. Some people pretend that veterans hate the VA system until they have to deal with private care, but having had a couple of surgeries and currently taking five prescription meds, if I had stuck it out with “free” care from the VA I’d have been fitted with a toe tag by now.",2024-05-09T02:22:02+00:00

You know, where the healthcare providers are all government employees and unaccountable for their actions and hospitals become government facilities. We’ve already seen the VA hire people whose licenses have been revoked for cause, and they’re so good at operating hospitals that they were forced to shut down a premier surgical suite due to a fly infestation. Just last year they had yet another case of facility administrators gaming the system to look like they’re meeting their performance goals by deleting appointments and referrals, which is what happened with the scandal in 2014.

My problem is that you brought up taxes as an issue, but the actual evidence shows that as yet another **disadvantage** for Americans. You brought up ""choice"" but refuse to engage in my reasonable, fact based argument about how Americans don't have more choice. You brought up supposed other benefits of US healthcare, but refuse to say what they are, but are offended I called your imaginary (or at least you won't share them) benefits propaganda.

Your employer might pay for your schooling after you have worked there for awhile. The program is called “tuition reimbursement.” Ask about it during your job interview.  Usually  you have to pay the education program yourself each semester, then your employer reimburses you after you pass the classes.  

This is how it works: when you pay for the first semester out of pocket and you complete the semester, it’s time to pay for the second semester. You will have  to have saved enough of your own money to pay for the second semester. It happens because your reimbursement for the first semester will not arrive to you on time to pay for the second semester by the school’s payment deadline. So you pay it out of pocket at first. 

When the reimbursement for the first semester finally arrives, don’t spend a dime of it. Put ALL of it into savings and leave it there. When it’s time to pay for your third semester, you use the reimbursement for your first semester that is sitting in savings to pay for the third semester. From here on, you receive the reimbursement, save every dime of it, and use it to pay  for the upcoming semester. No excuses ever about saving.  Save ALL of the reimbursement EVERY time. 

It’s imperative to meet your employer’s date deadlines each semester for informing them that you’re using the tuition reimbursement program in the upcoming semester. It’s also imperative that you submit your final grade and request tuition reimbursement by the deadline. They are drop dead dates that don’t flex because you forgot or whatever. Deadlines are rock solid. Don’t wait until the last minute to submit. Things go wrong. Submit your information the minute you receive it.  No delays. 

It’s your Human Resources department that manages all of this. Be nice to them. Stay on their good side. You need them.",2024-05-08T10:56:10+00:00

Healthcare facilities should be focused on improving patient health, lives, and outcomes, not making money. Hospital administrators cut costs by cutting staff, especially nursing, and cutting costs spent on necessary equipment and supplies. Administrators fatten their own pocket with the savings. Cutting staff creates unsafe nursing staff to patient ratios. Unsafe staffing can lead to falls, medication errors, surgical errors, infections, longer hospital stays, and other preventable complications. Nurses that are stretched thin can miss subtle changes that occur in the status of patients and miss an opportunity to address it and this can have disastrous results. When these complications and events occur insurance plans reduce the amount of payment the hospital receives for care, since quality care and adequate monitoring would have greatly reduced the risk of these complications. Insurance plans pay for quality care, not time spent suffering from preventable complications.

It's not really that simple. There are rules and regs from in different contexts across the entire system. Insurance regs, federal, state change quite a bit and effect every part of the process. Even if you did consolidate it, it's only as effective as how much people know about them. In home health we have the fed regs (not exactly light reading), the state regulations, Medicare billing rules, private insurance billing rules, etc. It's like a big puzzle that you have to put together. 

> Also, can't some of those administrative work be outsourced or be automated?

Automation is just picking up and getting steam. But the existing systems that are used (EHRs, billing software) are fragmented and weren't built with this in mind. And yes you can outsource, but it's not free and comes with it's own set of problems.

It's also REALLY difficult to express those nuances in software and as a result most take the approach of just being glorified excel spreadsheets relying on the users to workflow the data.",2024-05-11T15:12:05+00:00

For sure, it'll just be an issue of integrating them (and their output) into existing systems. I'm actually in the process of building something that will extract medical info from pdfs for our intake process to help speed up data entry. The only problem is it's in a completely different system since our current EHR has ZERO ways to get data in or build on top of. This is another part of why it's so difficult is that there are only so many systems a person can interface with before they get fatigue. We deal with this constantly. 

> some of my thoughts on how to automate the administrative work seems like a no brainer but again I am ignorant on what goes on truly in the healthcare world but looking to gain more insight though

It's an industry ripe for problem-solving and technology advancements, but if our fax machine goes down our agency comes to a halt. Which is to say that we still deal with pretty antiquated, disconnected systems that change often. 

When I was brought into the company I'm at, it was partially to start a new EMR and partially to modernize the agency. A lot of that was little tiny automations that picked up the slack (like building out Microsoft Teams for each new patient, alerting, workflows etc). They were pretty specific to our agency though and at the end of the day could never get data back into our primary system (the EHR).",2024-05-13T17:05:44+00:00

Healthcare,post,1clp589,leafwell_official,New study explores how medical cannabis laws impact health insurance costs for employers,"“States that passed medical cannabis laws, compared to states that did not pass such laws, saw decreases in the average total costs for employer-sponsored health insurance premiums.”

**Full disclosure**: I work for Leafwell, and our research team put [this research paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.26.24306383v1.full) together, but now that it's officially in pre-print, we wanted to share it with r/healthcare for thoughts and feedback.

Essentially, we wanted to investigate what impact — if any — medical cannabis laws could be having on the cost of employer-sponsored health insurance. 

Here are a couple of other key points:

* The difference in average total costs for employer-sponsored health insurance premiums, comparing states with and without medical cannabis laws, grew over time.
* Medical cannabis laws likely decreased the cost of both single and employee-plus-one coverage plans for average total premium costs.",2024-05-06T17:42:08+00:00

But then somebody runs this system through a hospital lawyer or risk management department, who says ""all of these patients need a colonoscopy done, they all need reminder letters and phone calls and need to be reminded of the horrors of colon cancer when not detected and treated early. And prioritizing some will be a medicolegal issue if one of the persons we decide is lower risk (even though past time for follow up colonoscopy by guidelines) develops colon cancer while waiting for us to get around to him. If his lawyer gets wind of this project we will have to defend ourselves for using this proprietary tool that has not been peer-reviewed and published and can't easily be defended as being the standard of care"".

What can I do? ","Basically- My father was laid off and his last day was December 29th, 2023. My birthday was in March 2024, where I turned 26. He says he signed me up for Cobra that would last from December 30th 2023 to June 30th 2024. Then he even said that he would be able to get me on his new job’s plan (Horizon) from July 1st to December 31st, 2024.

However, when I called his/my insurance a couple days ago (Aetna) they said my coverage ended on March 31st, 2024. My job gives a period of 30 days after the date of loss of coverage to hop onto their insurance via Life Event Enrollment, and it is now May 4th. The period is over, and it appears I have absolutely zero health insurance until my company’s open enrollment opens up again in November.

My options seem to be to try and somehow get on my company’s plan (probably not happening), see if there is a way I can get Cobra to extend to June 30th like I was originally told it would (not counting on this either) or get a short term health insurance plan myself that lasts from now to November. I don’t know what that looks like or where to start.

I’m really not sure what my options are right now, and I don’t know who to go to right now, so I’m asking Reddit.

There was a corporate merger, we all work remote, merger was poorly announced (if at all) during an extremely busy time. We had done open enrollment a couple months before. Turned out there was a NEW open enrollment. Didn't realize I was no longer covered until I had an urgent care appt for a possible fracture. I contacted benefits and was told I could request to be allowed to enroll even though by then it was 6 weeks after the deadline. Took a month before I was told I could and they enrolled me over the phone. It did turn out the plan I am sucks but I do have coverage.

So, it is worth contacting your benefits/HR people and explain your unusual circumstances and see if they will give you that flexibility.

Second, I think you are still within the window to apply for ACA (I think it is 45 days) if you can't do it through your job. If you aren't making 50k a year you would get some subsidy and since you're young you could do a high deductible plan pretty cheaply and probably do just fine while also being protected if something major happens.

Third--Cobra AFAIK lets you stay on the plan for up to 18 months. Usually the 45 day window would apply for reinstating but you would have to pay the premiums. So you can try that. But would likely cost more.",2024-05-04T05:47:12+00:00

1, talk to HR and try to get exception (imo unlikely but id try first)

I dont know that much about cobra but I would think you'd be able to get that still, but they are very expensive so while I'd look into it I'd also look elsewhere to compare. Not sure if you can currently apply to ACA plans but id look at least. 

4, if everything fails, just be uninsured and hope nothing bad happens? Obviously not ideal but at least being younger is in your favor to get through a few months worth of gap. If you do need care, you can check if you have any federally qualified health centers (FQHC) that all will offer a sliding scale payment option based on your income, its a requirement to be a FQHC (you may also have other clinics nearby that offer sliding scales but aren't official FQHCs). If you end up in the ED/hospital, try to go to a nonprofit (most are) and ask what their charity care/financial assistance is. At any doctors office, ask them if they offer financial assistance screening. Ive worked at places before where there is a sliding scale/assistance available but the patient has to tell us they need it or ask for screening. We would ask all patients paying out of pocket the sort of, your visit starts at $X and may increase with labs (which we can provide the price once we know what labs are recommended by provider), will that be ok with you today? We would often get patients who said yes because they needed the care but couldn't actually afford it. Technically we only we were supposed to offer screening if they said no at that point. If I knew it would be a big strain I would try to lead them into saying no and keep hinting and ""are you sure.....?"" While subtly trying to shake head. But if patient insisted they could afford technically i could get in trouble if I screened anyways. Luckily most patients took the hints (because I had a horrible micromanager so needed to be by the book if they were listening in)

Since you are over 26, I would guess the policy will officially go to you but whoever wants to pay can. They won't refuse payment because its your parent and not you or anything like that. But you will have to be the one to coordinate it all since it will be your plan. But my parents paid cobra for a sibling for a bit. I don't know the details of exactly how it was done but id imagine the sibling had an online account so parents probably just had password (personally, I wouldn't let my parents log in like that but I know sibling would. Id have first tried to see if there was a way to either just have me enter their credit card info or if I could give them some sort of temporary account specific to paying, no idea if cobra offers that though).

The steward can require you to prepay for records. They are not required to convert the record to a different format, so if they exist as paper, they don’t have to convert to electronic version.

They use the United Healthcare Choice Plus Network and it's a fixed indemnity plan.  It is about $146 dollar cheaper per month than COBRA through Aetna for medical and vision/ MetLife for Dental.

Not eligible for ACA as astronomical due to not eligible for any subsidies. Retiree medical is about $400 more than COBRA.

I can tell you why we physicians and facilities are not the ones to blame in this very understandable need to know the cost of medical care.  

It’s freaking ridiculously hard to navigate and keep up with the complexities that come with operating a healthcare facility.  Like unnecessarily difficult, expensive and most of all, time consuming.  Administration is overwhelming and it never ends or stays the same.  

We are somewhat forced to contract with insurance carriers if we want to acquire and retain any patients.  We have cut out a few over the years that were so difficult to work with it was costing us money to see patients in their network.  Those patients usually choose to find care elsewhere even though they are elated with the care and service they receive from us.  

Each insurance carrier like UHC, BCBS, Aetna, and Cigna have their own set of requirements for coverage as an overall standard.  What uHC will approve and pay for has different requirements than the others, rinse and repeat for the rest, too.  THEN each carrier writes hundreds of different types of policies that have their own sets of rules and requirements that are different.  Some require pre authorization, others require a referral from a primary care provider, others don’t require any prior approval as long as the doctor is contracted and in the network.  Each procedure or exam has a code that’s billed individually and those individual codes have requirements too.  We have to justify what we are billing to the letter of the contract otherwise the claim is denied.  Half the time we don’t know what the cost of the visit will be either until we receive an EOB from the carrier with a breakdown of patient responsibility even though staff (which costs money to employ) verify the patient benefits prior to the day of the visit.  We are given incorrect information daily and cannot do anything about it.  

Trust me when I tell you, we want to bill claims correctly the first time, collect the accurate patient responsibility on the day of service and get paid for the work we do and the care we give.  I don’t want to call a patient weeks after their visit and inform them they owe more money than we collected that day they were here.  I do want to get paid for my work so my only choice is to collect from the patient what the insurance calculated as the patient responsibility.  If I don’t, we don’t get paid.  It’s like working for free even though you except to be compensated.  

It’s such a broken and messed up system that could be so much easier for all of us.  Insurance companies aren’t in the business of helping people, they’re in the business to make money.  Google top grossing/profitable corporations in the United States and you’ll find the majority of the major carriers.

Anyone who know anything about medicine realizes, this isn't a physical at all, it's a 4 problem acute visit.  These are billed, and charged differently (and for good reason).  The patient then gets upset that they didn't get charged for a routine physical.

Eg 2.  Patient cones in for ""back pain"".  Is it a sprain, a herniated disc, chronic depression/anxiety, a kidney I fection, an aneurysm, menstrual cramps, a heart attack?  Not only do all of these need to ve considered, they all have radically different diagnostic and treatment paths.

Healthcare,comment,l2bzbgj,FourScores1,,"It used to be like that. Private practices - doctors were generally happier. Same with small business across many industries, large corporations bought them up, offered better deals because they had the resources, and pushed small businesses out of practice. Physicians lost control of healthcare around the 90s and it’s pretty much completely now in the hands of large corporations and organizations. In order to pass the ACA, the Obama administration completely banned physicians from owning hospitals to appease the healthcare lobbyists. MBAs wanted control now. 

Large corporations also could bargain with more leverage against the insurance companies compared to small private practices. Insurances wouldn’t deal with the small practices any longer. Many private practices had no choice but to sell or close shop. 

Now physicians have the highest suicide rate of any profession and high burnout rates. We are on your side - I promise. However we are but a cog on a massive wheel. 

There are far easier ways to make money than giving up decades of your life to study medicine and being in debt. I worry people simply will not pursue medical training in the coming decades.


I will add - middle men staffing agencies were using physician licenses whom they employed to bill insurances - at least in emergency medicine which I’m in - this was the whole surprise billing issue and these middle men forbid doctors from seeing what they were actually billing for. Congress stepped in and a handful of these staffing companies went under. A few weeks ago, ER doctors in Detroit actually went on strike due to unsafe staffing because these agencies didn’t want to pay for more doctor coverage. I’m hoping to see more of this.

Healthcare,post,1chbeb6,hatepickinganamee,Is my chiropractor trying to scam me? Says he will waive deductible ,"For background, I’m a 25 year old female in the US on my parents insurance plan which is state insurance. 

I visited a chiropractor this week who does the first intake session free. The next day, we had our second session where we reviewed my x rays and he suggested an ongoing treatment plan with 3 visits a week in the first  month then 1-2 visits a week after. 

He says the deductible for my insurance is supposed to be $300, and that my insurance covers 70% of each visit. He offered to waive the deductible and said he would accept a $20 copay per visit as opposed to the 30% (apparently, the cost of the 30% and the $20 are about the same)

He told me when the insurance mails the check for the visits, I have to bring it to the office. This will be about twice a month and I signed a paper saying I am aware that my insurance mails checks, and that I will bring him the checks. This seems normal. 

My concern is that he says I’m going to continue seeing the $300 balance for the deductible on my insurance  bill, and that I should just ignore it because he’s waiving it. I asked the front desk person what happens to that balance if I decide to stop treatment, since it will always be on the “expected contribution”. I didn’t really understand their answer.

***My question is: is it normal for a doctor to waive a deductible? If so, what steps can I take to make sure I’m not charged in the future?****

PS I also signed a estimate that says my expected cop pay is $20. The estimate paper says if I’m charged more than the good faith estimate, I have the right to dispute the bill. This makes me feel slightly safer but I want to be 100% before I move forward. ",2024-05-01T02:46:38+00:00

You need to get to the root cause of the problem to restore pain-free movement and function. If you aren't seeing any improvement in 2-3 visits or are only getting short-term relief, you need to modify the treatment plan. Without improvement, insurance will not continue to cover treatment.

Healthcare,post,1ch4ggf,DETpatsfan,At my wit’s end,"Honestly, today just broke me. I don’t have a solution or proposal to fix anything and this post may get ranty but I need somewhere to vent my frustration with the utter insanity the US healthcare system has become.

In the late fall of 2023, I got a letter from my insurance company that the manufacturer of my 3 year old son’s asthma medication was going to stop producing his daily inhaler and that we would need to switch to an alternative. The alternative that was provided for children under 6 years old was not an inhaler but a nebulizer solution (I.e. we would need to buy a several hundred dollar nebulizer machine and he would have to do a daily course of a 15-20 minute nebulized medication compared to the 30 second 2 puff inhaler he had in the past). Obviously this solution was bonkers as getting a 3 year old to sit holding a nebulizer to his face for 1/3 of an hour every night would have been akin to giving a lion a pedicure. 

We filled his inhaler earlier this year just before the cutoff deadline of when our insurance said they would stop covering it and this week was the first time we had to refill it since. I asked our doctor to submit an override authorization, which our insurance promptly denied and referenced the nebulizer alternative. I called my insurer and said what am I supposed to do? I can’t get a toddler to take a daily nebulized medication that he needs to prevent having a potentially devastating asthma attack. They told me “sorry it’s not covered, but if you decide to pay out of pocket for it then the cost will count against your deductible for your high deductible plan at least”. This medication is $320 for a 60 day supply so I went on GoodRX to find a coupon and saw that Walgreens had one for $90. $50 less than any other pharmacy. I called my son’s pediatrician and had them call in the prescription to a Walgreens pharmacy as we gave him the last doses of his previous inhaler today. 

I stopped at the Walgreens after work (and after my son’s doctors office had closed for the day) to pick up the inhaler. I get to the pickup window and the tech informs me that Walgreens does not accept my insurance so the cost of the medication will not count against my deductible. I had no other choice so I silently seethed while I paid for the inhaler that my sons **needs**.

I don’t understand how, in the year 2024 in the wealthiest country on earth, we can have a situation where an insurer can just decide that they are no longer covering a medication that is the 23rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States. **It helps keep my son alive for God’s sake.** How have we let things slip to such a ridiculous extreme that nobody is standing on their goddamn desk in congress and screaming about this bullshit? I don’t know if I’ve ever been angrier with this fucking hellhole than I am at this point.

I just called to make an apt with a new primary care because my insurance changed. I cant meet with any providers until October at the very earliest and it’s at a hospital an hour away. 

When I asked how I’m supposed to get my maintenance medications in the mean time, the phone operator told me to go to urgent care to get a prescription for it ?

 How is this advice that’s supposed to be given out by hospital telephone operators ?! 

As a nurse, people using urgent care or emergency rooms for non-emergent matters are one of the most annoying/wasteful use of time and resources we encounter. It’s a huge waste of resources and takes time away from patients who actually need our care and beds in emergency and urgent care clinics. 

Has anyone encountered this and how did you get a prescription for medications while you don’t have a primary care provider?

For reference, the two medications are birth control and an SSRI. ",2024-04-30T19:37:56+00:00

Healthcare,post,1cgy1ve,gogo--yubari,USA (NY)-anyone here on the Essentials plan & can a NON-Medicaid doctor write your Rx’s? Please help!," I was recently laid off & so I’m getting new insurance from the NYSOH marketplace. 

I do not qualify for Medicaid bc I earned some income in 2024 before I was laid off. 

But I will qualify for the Essentials plan.

There may be some confusion bc I vaguely remember hearing that the “essentials plan” is actually an umbrella term and there are an array of specific plans within that that you choose to use as your health insurance , with some Medicaid options and some non-Medicaid options that you can choose from.  

(either way, I’d be signing up for a NON Medicaid version of the essentials plan if they offer both)

The “Medicaid” distinction is extremely important for me, bc if you have ANY medicaid plan in NY then ALL of your Rx’s need to be written by a Medicaid doctor  or else your prescriptions won’t be covered by their pharmacy benefits (NYRX)…. And I have one Rx that I need every month from a doctor who is NOT a Medicaid Doctor. I cannot go without this medication and it will take months for me to switch to a Medicaid doctor for my issue (long story).

On the surface, it seems clear that it’s not Medicaid & everyone at the NYSOH exchange keeps telling me that the Essentials plan is NOT considered Medicaid, 

but my pharmacist told me that if you have the essentials plan then your Rx’s nevertheless must be written by a Medicaid doctor bc they have to “run it through the system as Medicaid”. And it will automatically be rejected by the system if the prescribing doctor is not Medicaid covered.

So I don’t know who to believe and I’m really nervous bc if my pharmacist is correct, then I’m gonna be screwed when I go to fill my Rx since it will have been written by a non Medicaid doctor.

The one thing I would REALLY TRUST is If anyone here actually is ON the essential plan and IS able to get their Rx’s filled by a non/medicaid doctor. Does anyone here have any experience with this 🙏?   ANY help would be greatly appreciated!!!",2024-04-30T17:09:59+00:00

Healthcare,post,1ceflxf,HahaSoFunni,What if I’m broke?,"Let’s propose a scenario.

I am about to die, someone stabbed me 4 times and I am bleeding out fast. I get to the hospital because someone decided to call an ambulance for me. I get the standard treatment in the ambulance, I get to the hospital and they do whatever it takes to save me. And thank goodness they save me, hooray I’m alive. I stay in the hospital an extra week until I recover a bit more. I get home and I get a $100,000+ medical bill in the mail. I almost have a mini heart attack just looking at the number, because I cannot afford it, nor will I ever be able to afford it on my $22,000 annual salary. 
I think back and wondered if I should’ve refused treatment and just die. Of course I’m grateful to be alive, I’m grateful to the doctors and nurses that saved my life. But now it feels like I’m trapped with this medical bill that I’m unable to pay. Obviously the hospital staff needs to be paid, they don’t work for free. But how am I supposed to deal with this.

Now a different scenario, well at least the second half. (I don’t have health insurance for both scenarios)

This time it’s the same scenario up until I get the medical bill. I look down at the $100,000 medical bill, but I just shrug it off and place it back down. Weeks and months go by and I ignore the medical bill, I don’t make any efforts to pay it nor do I intend to because I can’t afford it.

Should I have just let myself die and refused the treatment, so that I can avoid the medical bill? Me dying could’ve saved the hospital some money, because they wouldn’t have had to send out an ambulance and use all these medical supplies to save my life.

Healthcare,comment,l1iolxk,OnlyInAmerica01,,"This was the state of psychiatry/mental health ~20 years ago.  Insurance reimburseme ts had gotten so low, that all an psychiatrist could do was offer 10-15 min ""med adjustment"" visits, which defeated the entire point of their 4 years of advanced specialty training in psychiatry.

So slowly, then quickly, they dropped insurance all together.  Today, over 50% of psychiatrists practice purely on a cash-pay basis.  Ironically, this has also forced insurers to increase reimbursements to hire enough of the remaining 50% that are still available.  Overall, while mental health access in the U.S. is still in need of improvement, we are on the road to recovery.

I think the same will likely happen in primary care, and other high-value/low reimbursement specialties.  I think in 10 years, you will have brief superficial visits with a PA or NP if you want primary care through insurance, or pay out-of-pocket for a longer, and more thorough, visit with a doctor.

A lot of the time, it felt like they went into the appointment with pre-set things to say (or, usually, drugs to prescribe), and just told me the treatment and then moved on. 

All that changed for me when I turned to holistic/functional medicine. Providers that take this approach are committed to spending more time with the patient, because they want to get a **holistic** view (lifestyle, diet, full health history, etc). Often, initial consultations are 60-90 minutes (unlike the 15 minutes most doctors spend, as someone else mentioned). The drawback is that it's often more expensive than the conventional approach (and isn't usually covered by insurance), but there are some work arounds to do it more affordably.",2024-04-28T03:04:16+00:00

I work in compliance for Medicaid and Medicare Cost and Advantage plans and handling provider complaints is like 15% of my job.

Sorry, but I'm not familiar with UNH - if you meant UHG/UHC (as in United) I can get you the phone number they can call.

I also want to advise that I don't service those plans so the backend *maaaay* be different though I sincerely doubt it. While I also *technically* sell them, we use a TPA for that plan type.Functionally, they likely won't see a difference at all - at least not immediately.

On the backend a few things happen, but it's rarely actionable unless it's systemic.

* The case gets forwarded through regulatory complaints channels and ends up with Quality Improvement.
 * The regulatory complaints get audited by CMS quarterly and out-of-pattern complaint trends are investigated.
* Quality Improvement at the insurer has their own internal trend tracking and will sometimes pre-emptively reach out to the provider to advise of Quality of Care scores which can impact provider reimbursement options for federal programs.
* If the trend of provider complaints is consistent, the insurer may drop the provider, but that's very rare.

CMS can also take action, but again, that's super rare.

Most of what would occur is administrative and wouldn't be visibly impactful.

Unless you're their Power of Attorney and the insurer has, and has certified those documents as granting you the required authority, OR you're their CMS-1696-documented Authorized Representative and, again, the insurer has received those documents, you would not be able to file the grievance on their behalf and they would have to do so themselves.

I still recommend reaching out - knowing these things are happening is the only way that insurers and CMS can act - it truly helps a lot.",2024-04-27T03:04:22+00:00
Healthcare,comment,l1pjtxx,papayawellness,,"There are a lot of licensed doctors that practice holistic medicine (MDs and DOs). It’s more of a philosophy than one specific set of teachings. In terms of the workarounds, there’s a couple things you can do to cut down the cost. First, there’s something called integrative medicine, which is when a doctor combines the Western approach with holistic. I’ve found that these providers are more likely to accept insurance. Second, many providers will give you a superbill, which basically gives the coding for the diagnoses/procedures covered in the appointment. If you have out-of-network coverage as part of your insurance, you can submit the superbill to them and may be reimbursed a percentage. If you contact your insurance company beforehand and ask for pre-approval to see the provider, they can tell you if it’s likely to be covered/what percent they would reimburse. Lastly, most of these providers accept HSA/FSA, so that can be a good way to cover some or all of the out-of-pocket coat. 

In terms of finding holistic providers (specifically ones who are licensed), this is probably the trickiest part. You can always Google, but it can be difficult to know what to look for/search if you aren’t familiar with holistic medicine. It’s actually precisely for that reason that I run a (totally free) service where people can submit [a form](https://ho3dpaqvyie.typeform.com/to/pgNjEehx) with what kind of provider(s) they’re looking for, and we’ll send back a list of licensed people that fit their criteria. Like you said, a lot of people have only heard of holistic medicine in passing, so we’re ultimately looking to provide resources to help people get started (again, all free right now)",2024-04-28T23:04:54+00:00

Healthcare,comment,l1gfp8h,warfrogs,,"Happy to! Good on you for trying to understand the process.

One thing to keep in mind - a healthcare power of attorney does not extend to health insurance; CMS and carriers will not recognize it as empowering you to submit grievances on their behalf. You need to submit a general durable power of attorney, a financial power of attorney, or a power of attorney which specifically and explicitly grants you powers to act on their behalf for matters involving state and government programs; including enrollment, billing, complaints, appeals, claims, and protected health information. Or, you can just use the [CMS-1696.](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/cms-forms/cms-forms/cms-forms-items/cms012207) Either/or works just fine.

Your specific state may require additional, specific and explicit authorization for disclosure of some sensitive subjects including sexual health, substance abuse, and mental health services.

One thing I goofed up because I'm extremely tired at the moment - since it's a Medicare Supplement plan, the complaint will actually be forwarded to the regional Quality Improvement Organization contracted by CMS rather than the internal Quality Improvement teams.

The only types of lights I can find for walkers are the headlamp style lights.  We have night-lighting in our hallway, so he doesn't need a headlamp, just something that can help her locate the walker.

You could also buy one of those keychains that beep and flash when you whistle, and remove the little speaker so it just flashes. Then he could whistle to make it respond.

Yes, you can use your HSA to cover qualifying medical expenses for yourself, your spouse, and your newborn tax dependent... er... child.

IRS Publication 969

Qualified medical expenses are those incurred by the following persons.

1. **You and your spouse.**
2. **All dependents you claim on your tax return.**
3. Any person you could have claimed as a dependent on your return except that:
   1. The person filed a joint return;

Healthcare,comment,l11wwz6,Used-Somewhere-8258,,"Congrats on the baby! This is a good time to evaluate your family’s overall cost of health insurance. Assuming that you have a high deductible plan, it might save your family money overall to switch to a family plan.

Quick math:
Insurance premium cost for full year + total out of pocket max = total financial liability for the policy.

Now do that math for both your policies, and see if the better coverage is actually going to help you save money as a family of three, especially in the catastrophic event where we assume everyone meets the out of pocket max. 

Note that with two policies for your family, your premium will stay the same but your partner’s premiums will increase with the addition of a child, and so will their out of pocket max (likely).

I’d encourage you to put the entire family on your high deductible plan after baby’s birth, especially because most infant visits in the first year are considered preventative. And those that aren’t preventative are not actually that expensive compared to what your total insurance premiums will be for the year.

Reminder that the reason HSA plans are typically better for young healthy families is that you will assume some greater unpredictable costs (urgent care, typically $150-300 after insurance) in exchange for much much lower predictable insurance premiums. “better coverage” insurance is not a great deal for young, relatively healthy families because you end up with a lot of money spent on sunk cost insurance premiums that you COULD be investing in an HSA and saving until you have actual care needs.",2024-04-24T14:55:49+00:00

In a way, it looks like the insurance company is ""hedging"", to cover some of the potential losses incurred on a prescription. 

So, while an insurance company may lose money on a prescription, the PBM makes up for it through rebates & spread. But does the profit margin made by the PBM generally exceed the loss incurred by the insurance company on a transaction level? If it doesn't, then does the insurance company only profit from frequent usage of medicines only until the deductible is being utilised?

Healthcare,post,1c7zd0u,BobbyFranks123,Unexpectedly charged for a service supposed to be in-network,"Hi there. I live in the US. Can say the state if it matters. Last year we used an ambulance service that we were informed was in-network when we had to transfer from one hospital to another due to the first hospital not having a pediatric surgeon available.

Everything went well until we received the bills, when it turned out the ambulance provider was out of network. Since we had already maxed out our deductible for last year, being out of network meant we would need to pay the full amount ($1500) out of pocket. Our insurance provider, United HealthCare, ruled that we shouldn't be charged for the service and directly communicated this to the ambulance company. Unfortunately, they are disregarding this ruling and continue sending us notice to pay. I'd assumed that if UHC has ruled it's not chargeable then that should be it, but apparently not. UHC says they've done all they can. We also contacted the Colorado Division of Insurance for advice. They have advised us to open an appeal, but the ambulance company is saying they are going to send it to collections regardless. Has anyone else here experienced a similar situation or have advice for me? What do you think is the best course of action? If we don't pay that amount asap, it will be sent to collections, and we want to avoid that but it feels very unfair  to have to pay this amount.",2024-04-19T15:14:24+00:00

With a DoS that long ago, they've even missed the Medicaid timely of 365 days. 

Erisa helps providers when dealing with predatory insurance contracts that try to have very short timely filing deadlines. But even erisa has a limit on how long providers have to send out a claim. 

If the hospital billing department I worked for came across an account that was sitting in limbo for 16 months that we hadn't sent to insurance yet, we'd basically give up on it because we screwed up. Yeah we'd still send it to insurance to get the timely filing denial, but that'd fall on us. I'm not talking about a clawback either.

If this is a collections agency, it’s certainly an unfair claim under the circumstances. The registration people not updating the info didn’t help either. 

If nothing else, the provider needs to write this off if they are not going to put the effort in to get the approval from insurance or put in a request for an exception.

We have CIGNA insurance. We waited for five hours, was in the office less than 10 minutes, received a strep swab, and was ordered  medication to be picked up at the pharmacy. 
The urgent care submitted a bill to insurance for just under $900 and we received a bill for just under $500. The cost is being split between two items.
1. Roughly $300 is itemized as a new patient visit. 
2. Roughly $200 is just for the swab.

We have been trying to work with them but keep getting told to F off. If I had private paid, it only would’ve been $100 for the whole thing.

If Cigna's contracted rate for this would have been 500.00 and they have applied that to your deductible, then this would make sense.

I follow up with insurance companies and understand why claims get denied and can often verbally appeal these decisions on the phone resulting in payment.

I like the work and it’s so gratifying to identify the issue and help hospitals get reimbursed but I just feel stuck and I want to learn more.

Healthcare,post,1c5ubye,_ImaGenus_,How do I leave Kaiser Permanente? (USA),"Hello, I'm (M, 53) originally from NZ and struggle with stuff like this. I live in NorCal and have only had Kaiser since I've been here. I've always disliked it but every employer I've been with here unfortunately uses Kaiser.

Early last year Kaiser screwed up a Carpal Tunnel procedure, and I still constantly struggle with it and I hate having to pay them every month. It pretty much cost me a years income last year (I was self employed throughout the pandemic and had Kaiser through Covered California).

I'm now working for a company who again has Kaiser. I'm dealing with chronic pain and insomnia and Kaiser has again been disappointing. My wife told me to check out One Medical (which is an Amazon product I think), but Kaiser won't let me look for care outside their system.

As I understand it, I can't change to a new insurer until the end of the year. Am I wrong in that?

Is there any way for me to be able to affordably use another insurer and access One Medical or a similar system? Because of my dud hand and chronic pain I only work part time so I need to keep expenses as low as possible 

Am I screwed? I really need help sleeping, and need to change to another insurer/provider pronto... Can anyone please give me some helpful suggestions? If I can escape, who should I escape to?

Much appreciated!

Do you have an HMO or is it PPO for your care? It sounds like an HMO if Kaiser won’t let you go outside of the system for care. 

Since you’re stuck with Kaiser, what do you want to do - are you looking for a referral to a specialist? Is your doctor not responding to you or giving you the run around? What would help you in your current situation? I don’t live in California but my dad does and I had a bit of success in helping him get the care he needs as his POA.

Healthcare,comment,kzx2rdn,_ImaGenus_,,"Hi! Thanks for replying!

Yes, Kaiser is an HMO. It's a monster.

I need a referral to their Interventional Pain clinic.

I went into the main SF Kaiser last month (I don't live in San Francisco but they had no appointments for over a month at my local Kaiser, where my doctor is a no show and they don't know when he'll be back... I'm not even kidding), and the very young Dr. there in SF (who I later found to be a graduate from the not so prestigious ""American University of the Bahamas"" referred me to the Chronic Pain clinic, which after talking with them seems to be the wrong clinic.
I tried finding another doctor at my hospital to switch to so I could sort this out (because you have to go through a PCP/Dr. for everything.(no kidding, if you shatter a bone you still have to go to that person to get a referral for an orthopedic surgeon, paying co-pays for each, as well as another co-pay at radiography where X-rays will be taken) and there was only one taking new patients, and he was trained in Nepal...I'm sorry, but I don't particularly want a Nepalese trained Dr.

Why can't I just be attended to by a US trained Dr.? Surely they're better trained. I'm married to a person of color, my dentist is African American... I'm not racist...I just want someone who I know is trained properly.

Here's Kaiser in a nutshell. As well as my pain and insomnia issues, I also have a weird lump in my mouth (hopefully not serious, l guess I'll ask my dentist at my next appt. lol), and something seriously wrong with my thumb after getting a Cortisone injection from them a few months ago (also in the hand they screwed up the surgery on). When I tried to seek treatment for all these issues I was told he ""wouldn't have time for everything, what are your two most serious complaints?""
This after $400 in Uber rides to get there and back and multiple copays.
I just want out. I'm sick and tired (literally) of substandard care.

Sorry for the ranty explanations!!",2024-04-17T00:56:52+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kzxj190,JojoCruz206,,"I’m going to be honest with you - you’re going to have a tough time if you only want to see physicians who went to American medical schools. Plus, that doctor from Nepal (and most other doctors you encounter in the US) will have done their medical residency training in the US - meaning that they have done 3 years of training in the US. Personally, I would take who I could get. I don’t know if that physician is new to Kaiser, but you might have an easier time with a physician that is not as embedded into the Kaiser system as they aren’t as resistant to denying you care or referring you to a specialty. 

In the meantime, why isn’t that doctor you saw in SF referring you to the correct pain management clinic? I would message them through the Kaiser portal, call their office, whatever - hassle them until they respond to make the correct referral. 

If they don’t give you the referral - take it up with the Member Services department. 

Re: sleep disorder — Are you seeing a sleep specialist for the insomnia? I would try to get a referral to one if you can. If there is going to be a delay in getting that put through, I would consider setting up an appointment with a psychiatrist to see if they can evaluate your insomnia - it’s my understanding that you don’t need a PCP referral to see a psychiatrist through Kaiser, you can directly call and make a “mental health appointment” with psychiatry yourself. The psychiatrist might refer to you a sleep specialist (if Kaiser allows this) but they can at least do an initial evaluation. I have a sleep disorder that is managed through a psychiatrist. I did see a few different sleep medicine specialists to get my diagnosis, but my meds are managed through a psychiatrist.",2024-04-17T02:42:32+00:00

Healthcare,comment,kzxsmcu,_ImaGenus_,,"Thank you for replying!

Some very good advice, thank you.

I was not aware that I could deal with my sleep issues through a psychiatrist. I've been prescribed Trazodone, but I'm so groggy for the 1st couple of hours after waking. I'm taking it only after not getting much sleep for a couple of nights. Without taking anything (I take Tylenol PM and Ibuprofen by default to knock back some pain before I even try sleeping), I tend to lie there for a couple of hours before sleeping a couple of hours and waking with pain. I then have to settle and try to get more sleep. Sometimes I can get another hour or two. Sometimes not. There's been times I've done a work week on an accumulated 15 hours sleep. Sometimes ~1 hr, sometimes 4 maybe 5hrs.

I did see a sleep specialist a couple of years ago and  was put on CPAP from that point. I will endeavor to see another.

I get your point about the Drs doing their residency here... I will sign up with the chap...it just seems ""less than"" to be plied off onto a Nepalese Dr or constantly told we don't have any Drs. appointments available but you can see a nurse practitioner. I'm sure there are some very able nurse practitioners out there, but I'm not exactly happy paying thousands of hard earned dollars a year and struggling to see someone whom I think ""has the stuff"".

Healthcare,post,1c5oxxa,Radrezzz,Industry’s handling of drug shortages (USA),"I can’t believe how crappy the experience is up and down the line. We have seen outages of certain medications since at least the pandemic started more than four years ago, and no one has fixed this.

First let’s start with the pharmacies. They have apps and websites for getting scripts filled. None of the apps have the ability to query for what drugs are available at what location. If my current pharmacy runs out I need to call around every other company to talk to a pharmacist who then has access to query for me.

But wait! In order to talk to a pharmacist your first *have to get passed the automated voice system*. None of these systems are programmed to handle voice prompts for when you ask if a medication is in stock. 

>What is your reason for calling today? It sounds like you’re looking for the availability of an item in our store. Did you know you can check if we have things at Walgreens.com? Oh, you want to talk to a pharmacist? What is the reason for that? It sounds like you want to fill a prescription. I don’t see any prescriptions associated with your phone number…”

On and on, over and over, for every store you call. Why can’t they fix this?

When you finally get through, sometimes the pharmacist can lookup every store. Sometimes they tell you that you have to call them yourself.

The script I’m trying to fill has a generic and name brand version. The generic is of course covered by insurance and name brand runs $400/month. This month my pharmacy had just the name brand and not the generic. In fact no one has the generic.

I called my insurance company to see if they can make an exception since there is now a global shortage on the generic. This is a popular drug with many consumers. They’ve known about the shortage from the manufacturer for some time.

Rather than prepare the call center for these types of calls, they choose to waste hours of your time giving you a runaround. We have to call our mail-in pharmacy to see if they have it. They don’t! Let’s see if they have another version of the generic (what are the side effects of changing?)… nope! No we won’t cover the name brand. We need a note from your doctor (?). You need to file an appeal.

Like how do they not have all these things answered already?

Incidentally they originally told me I couldn’t get this script filled by mail, but now all the sudden it’s cool. Man I’d rather deal with the one mail order pharmacy rather than having to call all these pharmacies one by one.

If we stop taking this pill then the condition comes right back. It’s something a doctor agrees needs treatment. I have a medical plan with a $4000 deductible and another $4000 in “co-insurance” bullshit on top of a huge monthly premium. This insurance company makes a profit of $91B per year. It’s not my fault that the generics aren’t available. But now I have to eat the cost? When the pills likely cost pennies to make, too.",2024-04-16T19:28:39+00:00

This is the CMS proscribed process - of course they're going to suggest looking at in-house alternatives or alternative delivery methods to reduce costs. If they don't have a purchase order agreement with the manufacturer for the non-covered med, they're paying the UCR rate at best since they're negotiating at a disadvantage.

The appeal process is, again, a CMS standard. They can't cover non-formulary meds without confirming medical necessity without offering them to everyone - and if an exception is granted once, it has downstream effects that can be felt for years. Again, CMS dictates that they do this. Every person's situation and medical necessity, including contraindications for other covered medications, medication history, etc. is mandated to be checked to determine the appropriateness of an exception.

Again, insurers have to follow this process every single time - if they make an exception for one person out-of-standards, they must make an exception for most everyone or acknowledge that there was a process or service failure. This has downstream effects during HHS and CMS audits.

>Incidentally they originally told me I couldn’t get this script filled by mail, but now all the sudden it’s cool. Man I’d rather deal with the one mail order pharmacy rather than having to call all these pharmacies one by one.

The unfortunate truth is that most insurer first-line phone reps aren't very good. If they're actually employees of the insurer and not contracted, vendored-out reps, they tend to stay in a first-line contact center role for a year or two at most. The good ones move up and out, the AWFUL ones get separated - so the first-line call centers are usually staffed by bog-average people. It's why I always recommend people write to their insurer. Written reps may not be better universally, but they *tend* to be more experienced and absolutely have more time to research and determine resolution routes.

Your insurer, in all likelihood, would also prefer that you do Mail Order - they tend to be longer fills which means fewer claims requiring processing.

>It’s something a doctor agrees needs treatment.

Your doc should then be able to easily prove medical necessity on your Exception request  - you may even want to ask them if they can file it on your behalf as all exception determinations require documentation from the prescribing physician to support medical necessity. If you file it yourself, the insurer's appeals group will request documentation from the physician - usually allowing between 5-20 business days for a response (30 day turn-around-time guidelines for appeals is very standard but may vary state-by-state and plan-type by plan-type.)

Ensure that they include your full medication and therapeutic history in the treatment of your condition with the file - be forewarned, if it gets kicked back for ""lacking documentation"" there's a VERY decent chance that the physician asked the office staff to fax or upload documents, and the office staff didn't follow through properly. That happens *literally* all the time and is the source of about 60% of the denials I work that end up in front of FSH and IRE boards on appeal - I know this because it's often the first time we're talking to the prescribing physician during process.

We show them what we received from their office - they show us what they asked their admin staff to send - and we're missing over half the notes. Once my clinician sees the full notes, including the medical history and contraindications, we withdraw our denial and the case never goes into the hearing.

Seriously, over 60% of the cases last year that I prepped for appeal hearings were withdrawn by us the same day of the hearing because we finally got what we had been requesting from the physician for months.

I knew there was no way I could afford a visit to the dr or hospital, so I cleaned it up, put a rag there for bleeding, & duck taped it to my leg.  Cleaned and changed it until it was healed enough.  I had my oldest 4 days before my 20th birthday & my first appt with the dr was when I was 19 weeks pregnant.  Because I had no insurance, was young and didn't know what to do at first, and finally got approved for Medicaid at that time and scheduled an appt.  Also, my oldest (almost 13) started having hallucinations. Almost a week after her doctor prescribed a medication to help, we ended up in the ER because her hallucination turned scary, and she was freaking out.  We were there from 10pm-9amish the next morning & they gave her an initial dose of the new medication.  I called the insurance, and they denied the authorization for her medication, so I filed an appeal & had to contact her dr to send medical records and possibly do a peer to peer.  I was advised before leaving the hospital to try and use a discount card to get her the medication while we wait on insurance. So I had to transfer her prescription to another pharmacy where it is cheaper and purchase it out of pocket using a discount card.  I believe they finally authorized her medication, so hopefully, we will have insurance covering it going forward.  But, yeah, the ""great"" USA...  Where you can't afford to go to the doctor without insurance [and sometimes with insurance--I've seen people with 12k deductibles (meaning the member must pay 12k every year before insurance pays for anything)] & sometimes insurance can also be a barrier to care, as they are looking at profiting and not paying for things that they deem as not medically necessary.

For people under 65, there’s a divide between Medicaid for the poor, and private insurance people get through their job. Medicaid covers most costs, but it is very difficult to get care unless it’s an emergency. For privately insured people, mostly working people making middle or high wages, some people have great insurance—called “Cadillac” insurance— and others have horrible insurance with very high deductibles and copays on everything. This is the group with most of the catastrophic medical bills. 

Even with all of this, almost all children have insurance through Medicaid, if their parents don’t have insurance. 

The people left behind are workers with low paying service jobs who have no insurance and don’t live in a state where they can buy a plan themselves. Anything happens to them and all of their savings are wiped out by medical bills.

There may be a yearly deductible to be met, and it can be substantial ($2k to $10k), but for many people that deductible has already been met before an injury. In almost all cases, the insurance has a max-out-of-pocket, maybe $6000, after which the insurance pays everything, so generally 92% of people are covered for anything over that. 

Subsidized government insurance (low premiums) is available to all Americans with lower incomes. It also comes with lower deductibles and out-of-pocket. In 40 states out of 50, if you have a very low income, your insurance and all medical care except vision and dental is totally free (like mine is). If you're over 65 you're covered for 80% of costs and most people sign up for a cheap policy on top of that which covers the rest (this is a simplification).

This is a complex topic for sure, but so far, based on my convos with people in the industry, here’s what they say:

Pros: 
1. if implemented systemwide, could reduce healthcare spending by $1trillion a year.

2. Increases competition in healthcare= helps reduce price gouging and surprise billing by hospitals

3. More autonomy and savings for patients. ( price of a single head CT can vary by over $2000 in the same city!)


Cons:

1. Not really applicable to emergency procedures where patient doesn’t have any choice in “shopping” for healthcare.

2. Inaccurate data. Historically, price transparency data has been very limited and is often drastically different from the actual price you end up paying. (Many reasons for this)

3. Resistance from hospitals. Hospitals would lose money if prices go down due to transparency so they are very reluctant to comply due to lack of financial incentives. Compliance rates are as low as just 20% in some states like Alabama.



P.S. I would really appreciate if you could support a project I am working on about this topic by answering a short 30 second [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/R3VP87P).",2024-04-14T18:46:50+00:00

A big chunk of that spending was end of life care.

At the same time, a little over 50% of all of us account for just 3% of health spending. average annual per capita in this group: around $390. 14% of the population recorded $0 health spending in 2021.

Prices are important to all of us, as an ""economy"", when, among other things, consumers have discretion to act on the basis of price variations, and at the same time providers of services have ""compelling reasons"" to amend prices in response to demand (or lack of it).

Healthcare,comment,kzl6t89,elevenstein,,"I think the only argument one could make against price transparency, would be that there is a potential for providers to collude on pricing.

The difficulty with price transparency in practice is that in very few instances does the actual cost of a service to the consumer, align with what the provider charges. In most cases the base price is determined by a contract between the provider and your insurance company. To complicate things further, your insurance company then determines your ultimate out of pocket cost (deductible, co-ins, non-covered items).

As an example, a provider may charge 150.00 for a chest X-Ray. Usually the only person who would pay that 150.00 would be a patient without insurance who does not qualify for any financial discounts. In most cases, the contracted rate for a payer will be less than these published charges (Medicare rate is around $35). In some cases the contracted rate could be higher than the stated charges, but this is rare.

For more complex services, you often can't determine what the pricing will be until the cases are coded and abstracted. The clinical coding is used to assign payment groupings (DRGs / ASC Groupings) that then will have a contracted price for each payer.

The problem with the current state of price transparency is that it often is limited to the provider publishing a list of charges that are really useless for most patients.

There has been a lot of progress made in the industry, in improving the accuracy of the cost estimates in planned elective surgery. I expect this will get better with AI. Essentially, providers use software to look at the historical clinical data along with payer specific contract terms to arrive at an estimate of true out of pocket cost.

One thing to note about healthcare reimbursement , is that just being insured is a cost advantage. Even if you have a large deductible, your out of pocket payment is based on the payer's already discounted rates. I had this conversation a lot with people when the ACA passed. Many people were asking themselves, why would I pay for insurance with a 10000.00 deductible. Obviously, insurance would limit your liability to 10K if something catastrophic occurred, but you usually will end up paying far less for services, even if they are applied to your deductible.

I think the bigger question in my mind is, what positive benefit do insurance companies bring to the process of healthcare delivery, that would warrant us creating such a convoluted process for consumers?",2024-04-14T21:08:22+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kzl8hjt,OtherwiseGroup3162,,"Pro: Everyone thinks providers and hospitals are so profitable and make so much money. When in reality the insurance companies are the ones making all of the money. Look at UHC growth over the past 15 years or so. Price transparency can lead to more knowledge of where all the money is going, not to mention lower prices overall.

Cons: not really a con of price transparency, but it is hard to price a lot of services for the common man. A good example is a baby being born. There is a newborn DRG, and a Delivery DRG. Both of those are separate prices and charges, but the common person thinks of one hospital stay. Even if you could get a C section DRG for $10, it doesn't matter if the newborn DRG price is $70,000. The common person thinks the price is $70,010 where the $10 C section is the lowest price in the country.",2024-04-14T21:18:28+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kznj4hg,paradocs21,,"This is an important question. After 40 years working as a family doc, I understand the situation and think most of the other comments here are misguided. The basic problem is this: In most advanced civilized wealthy countries medical care is considered **a ""public good."" (**Google it. It is a technical economic term.) Public goods include roads, the internet, fire departments, basic (even college) education, police departments, etc. Universal medical services are organized and often paid by the national government. (Note this is not necessarily ""socialized medicine"" where the hospitals are owned by, and the docs are employed by the state.) Think Sweden, Denmark, France, Singapore, Taiwan.

In the United States, for both historical and political reasons, we have a commercial, market based distribution of medical care. For many reasons this does not work well. At its core market based medicine requires pricing the services. The way prices are determined makes market-based medicine intrinsically and unavoidably a farce, designed to maximize profits.  **As long as I can keep my pricing obscure I can maximize my income and take advantage of you.** First, you should recognize that most purchases of medical care are not made by you, they are made by a physician. They are ""bought"" primarily according to what you NEED medically and most doctors do not pay attention or even know the prices of what they order (purchase). Secondly, PRICE can mean a lot of different things. (1) It can be a mark up from COSTS. (2) It can be  a set PAYMENT SCHEDULE. Medicare and Medicaid, and sometimes health insurance work this way. (3) It can be totally MADE UP. All hospitals and clinics have a ""Chargemaster,"" which is a catalog of individual services, each with an arbitrary (very high) LIST PRICE. This is the BILL given to uninsured patients. (4) It can be a PAYMENT. A hospital may have contracts with many insurance companies each of which has negotiated a different PRICE (payment) for the same service. (5) It can be a CHARGE. This is the bill you get after care is given. It usually represents the chargemaster price minus what your insurance agreed to pay minus any adjustments the insurance company has negotiated or requires and what your insurance says you must pay out of pocket.

Thirdly, you should be aware that although you are a patient, market medicine makes you a consumer even though in most cases you want to shop for QUALITY OR TRUSTED MEDICAL CARE, and only rarely for the cheapest care (except maybe when you are kicked out of the market by not being insured.) Fourthly, it is rare and often impossible to ""shop"" for medical care at all. Many people see doctors and go to hospitals permitted/allowed/limited/dictated by their insurance and if, say, you have a high fever, chest pain, a car accident or are unconscious you go or are taken to the nearest hospital and you CANNOT shop.

If you understand all these points, then you will recognize the movement for ""price transparency"" is political theater. It focuses on a market based solution for a system that cannot and should never be based on a commercial, free market model. It is searching for a ""repair""  while maintaining the inefficient, ineffective, exploitive, costly medical care system.",2024-04-15T08:56:29+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kzp48mj,HIPAA_University,,"There’s really no “against” argument except form insurance companies who will say “well it’s just too complicated” and they’re “right” about that. 

This is an incredibly complex issue, and it’s not just “well the doctors!” or “well the democrats/republicans!” Everyone is to blame, but it’s not one particular group or persons “fault” if that makes sense. 

This is a DEEP rooted issue that really took shape in the 1950s when employer sponsored health coverage became a normal thing. The US economy was booming, and labor unions, instead of paying people more, looked for creative ways to have “better” compensation packages for workers, and boom — the birth of employer-sponsored coverage. 

I definitely shift a greater % of the blame to insurance companies, but major providers, physicians, lobbyists, and us as consumers have also played major parts in this whole debacle we’re now in.

Healthcare,comment,kzwmi0q,OnlyInAmerica01,,"While I think some of your points are valid, you significantly underestimate the bigger problem.  Globally, nobody wants to pay for medical care, because high quality medical care is ***freakin' expensive***.  This is especially true if a society wants ***everything done, for everyone, at any cost, and immediately, and PERFECTLY, each and every time***.

That's the expectation American's have.  Few realize how radically different (and paternalistic) healthcare is outside of the U.S. 

These quaint notions of ""joint decision making"", even ""informed consent"" are cursory at best, purely non-existent in the extreme in other countries.  ""Here's your healthcare, take it or leave it"" is a pretty standard approach in most places where government pays for your care.  And the public is fine with that, because unlike the U.S., people see healthcare for what it is - an extremely expensive services provided in limited quantities as finances allow, for the greater good.  Again, completely alien to the typical mindset of most U.S. healthcare consumers.  

Bottom line - ***healthcare in the U.S. reflects the American culture of individualism, and treating all services like commodities - ""I'll damn well get what I want, when I want it, and however much I want!""***

Based on my interpretation of their [study](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24869/w24869.pdf), it seems like the study is suggesting that the reason patients don’t shop around for healthcare is because they just follow the advice  of their referring physician.

So I wonder what you think of price transparency solutions that can be synced up to patients’s EMR, so that physicians can access this information and make a more informed decision when referring their patients?

For example, many of the PCPs I have met already encourage their patients to compare costs of prescriptions on GoodRx.

Healthcare,comment,kzkvbjn,Fufrasking,,"I guess I have to ask: how long are we going to discuss the inequities of our current healthcare ""system?"" 

I'm 60, and we have been discussing this issue ad nauseum for my entire life and here we are, no closer to seeing meaningful change. 

Bernie tried to raise this issue to the forefront, and what hapoened. They conspired to make certain to remove Bernie from relevancy on this issue. Now Bernie still talks about it. Talk is not enough.

What fries my ass is that a huge part of the solution is simple, easy to implement, would improve care and reduce costs dramatically virtually overnight. And it would save the vast majority thousands per year. That solution is government health insurance.

Go ahead, challenge me. Prove me wrong. ""Medicare for all,""  Bernies baby, is okay, but it doesn't spell out the solution as simply and succinctly as government health insurance does.

Bernie, imo, did a shitty job of articulating this obvious truth. First of all, for reasons I have never understood, when he spoke about cost, he always quoted the ten year cost. Instead of saying it would cost 250 billion a year, he would always say $2.5 trillion. Then, he would never deduct the premiums and deductibles from that total. That would have shown a savings of billions instead of a cost. 

The point is, it seemed as though Bernie wasn't on the side of change. If you can't sell cheaper, better insurance that would save most people thousands a year while improving care and saving billions - you are doing it wrong.

So here we are. Democrats against national health insurance just like republicans. On any substantive issue (issues that cost corporations and the rich actual money) the two parties are identical. They both are corporately owned, they both work for their interests and act against the interests of average Americans. They are both part of the war war for profit machine that is murdering people around the world. Abortion, guns, the border, lgbtq rights, they are different. Corporate handouts, war, healthcare and taxes - they are the same party. 

Realize that Obamacare is saving private insurance. Imagine, instead of simply insuring high risk individuals (like the old) directly, we pay for-profit insurers and their huge profits the money. 

We need to stop pretending voting for change makes any significant core difference.  Unless we vote third party. Whatever the cost for four years, we need to shake them up. Especially the dems.

Healthcare,comment,kzcbj9h,tenyearsgone28,,"Me: Executive administration at a public hospital 

Rewards: I have a direct impact on making the work environment better for our patient-facing staff. Patients that have no where else to go, receive just as good care as those at private hospitals.

Challenges: More workplace violence occurs because a larger percentage of the patients we see are mentally ill homeless people that cannot be turned away. Turnover and morale suffer because of this. They also negatively impact throughput because a lot use the hospital for free meals and lodging.

Favorite Part: I’m pretty free to do my own research and come up with solutions. They may be modified at higher levels, but I’m respected in my field.

Changes: I would get rid of most of the meetings and committees, especially DEI. Most can be emails and we don’t have time for the DEI’s latest pet project. The current push is to “hire those that wouldn’t otherwise be hired due to a lack of qualifications”. Absolutely not; we’re responsible for saving lives so only the best candidates are wanted.",2024-04-13T04:40:42+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kzlcgrh,AquariusAction,,"Practice admin -

Rewards: Getting to work with lots of different job functions to contribute to giving better care and also making clinical teams’ lives easier. 

Favorite Part: If you have a good culture in your specialty it’s a great environment to work through new ideas and challenges. Lots of mutual respect and positive relationships between providers and admin. Also get to be involved in a lot of fun and interesting projects. 

Challenges: Having to say “no” to ideas/projects/other things providers want to do. Providers tend to jump into things or ideas with the focus to give the best care to patients and sometimes we have to be the “no people” to pull back and make sure everything is in compliance legally, and makes sense financially. If you have bad relationships with the clinical teams it can turn into an “us vs. them” environment

 Things I would change: The culture/narrative of calling patients “customers” and focusing on “customer service” in branding and trainings. personally I believe customer service and  patient communication are two different things. We want to be able to connect and communicate and empower patients as empathetically as possible, but when we start to see things as transactional and working with “customers”, I believe that it contributes to an increase in patient violence towards care teams and there is a belief they’re paying us to do our jobs, and also takes the empathy out of the industry",2024-04-14T21:43:14+00:00

1) I saw my neurologist for migraines. He asks how often I am having them, I say every day. I’m a fucking mess in that office, I think it’s clear that I didn’t even have the energy to make shit up just to… get meds?…. if I wanted to. He seems sympathetic and prescribes me a “month’s worth” of meds. 

The meds arrive, and there’s 8 packets. I look at the notes from my visit and he reported that I’m in pain 8 days a month. So, now, instead of crippling migraines 30 days a month, I now only have them 22 times a month! What the fuck?

2) I went on medical leave a few months ago for a combination of physical and mental health. For a lot of reasons, it was documented just as severe depression and suicidality. 

My doctor asks how often I’m depressed, and I say every day. She asks me how long I’ve been dealing with depression, and I say 14 years. So she fills out all of the paperwork I need to submit for medical leave, and then, months later, it gets bounced back to me because she recorded that I am depressed two days a week and that it’s not a chronic condition. I’m sorry, do I need 15 years in order for it to qualify as chronic??

I had 0 payments from work and only 1/2 of the medical leave pay over my three months of leave because 2/days a week and not chronic qualifies for brief/intermittent leave, not a full three months. I had to borrow money for the first time in my life, and thank god I’m privileged enough to have a family member who could lend me money. Eventually I got all the payments - months later and after I had returned to work - but only after she had to re-do the paperwork for the same reason THREE TIMES.

When I visited back in the early 1970's, someone in Galveston had to go to an office in another city to fill out Medicaid paper work and then personally return later to see if it was approved. Texas lags most other states in healthcare outcomes, ranking at the bottom of most health indicators. In 2021 in Texas, the death rate was 942.1 per 100,000 people.  
After accounting for differences in age makeup between states, Texas had the 18th-highest death rate. In 2020, Texas ranked 30th in life expectancy. A newborn in Texas was expected to live 76.5 years. Life expectancy in Texas is 0.5 years lower than life expectancy in the US overall. Texas also has a very high maternal mortality rate: the overall number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births increased from around 10 in 1999 to around 22 in 2019. According to the March of Dimes, in 2023 while the U.S. as a whole has a relatively high preterm birth rate of 10.4 percent, Texas was even worse, with a preterm birth rate of 11.3 percent. In Texas in 2021, 1,977 infants died before reaching their first birthday, an infant mortality rate of 5.3 per 1,000 live births. In Texas in 2022, 69.7% of infants were born to women receiving adequate/adequate plus prenatal care.

In 2020, healthcare spending by businesses, insurance agencies, households, and governments cost $9,822 per Texas resident. Texas ranks 48th-highest based on healthcare spending per person. Texas has the distinction of having the highest uninsured rate (24.3%) and the highest total number of uninsured : 5 million individuals. It is one of 10 states not to have expanded Medicaid with 100% federal subsidy under the Affordable Care Act. In Texas eligibility for Medicaid is **limited to legal residents** who are: a child younger than 18, pregnant, or responsible for a child 18 years of age or younger, or blind, or have a disability or a family member in your household with a disability, or are 65 years of age or older.

The removal of 1.3 million children from Medicaid was largely due to logistical and bureaucratic mechanisms, as all poor children should remain eligible. All of this data reflects Texas' individualistic, go it alone attitude and a cultural history of racism against Blacks and Hispanics.

Someone close to me has had 2 major surgeries over the last 2 months. Both were scheduled well in advance. Both times they have had to wait 5+ hours in recovery for a room. 

Now I completely understand emergency room wait times, but they are waiting for a room to open up on a transplant floor. Why are these rooms not scheduled to be available for these people when they are done in recovery? 

I know that they are safe and okay while they wait, but it is SO loud down there and it is literally impossible to be comfortable and rest after their procedure while they are experiencing much pain and discomfort. 

I am not trying to come off as ungrateful or demanding,  I am just sitting here waiting for them to get moved. I get to visit with them for 5 minutes every 2 hours while they wait and it is hard to see them be so uncomfortable after going through all of that. 

I am totally not bothering the nurses down there about it.  I know they dont have control over the situation. I guess I am just frustrated and bored.

Healthcare,comment,kz5gh7f,sjcphl,,"Could be a variety of issues:

- ED is getting slammed. Most EDs are boarding lots of patients, which is when the patient has an admission order but there are no beds available. This is terrible for staff and patients alike, so they are a priority.
- People aren't leaving as quickly as they should. Mrs. Jones was supposed to be out today, but the nurse noted blood in her stool so she's staying another night as the doctor is investigating.
- Normal logistical stuff. Housekeeping is short staffed so the room isn't clean yet. There were a bunch of ED admits so the floor is asking PACU to hold them a little while longer until a nurse is available to do the admission assessment.
- Perhaps anesthesia wanted to monitor your loved one a little longer. PACU has low nurse:patient ratios and is usually set up to permit direct visualization. The nurse on the floor will have more patients and almost never has line of sight to the patient, so you want to make sure he/she is stable before they leave.

By the way, PACU can also serve as ICU overflow. I've seen patients spend the entirety of their stay in a PACU under certain circumstances. So five hours, while inconvenient, isn't so bad.",2024-04-11T22:53:45+00:00

Healthcare,comment,kz5o2b1,DrTwinMedicineWoman,,"Rooms aren't assigned in advance. The reasons for this are multifactoral, but the biggest one is because needs fluctuate quickly and reserving rooms would be wildly inefficient. The predicted type of room that a patient needs after surgery isn't always correct. Sometimes, people unexpectedly need to go to the ICU.  Or surgery might be quicker or shorter than expected. Rooms are constantly being turned over; it's not like a hotel where everyone stays until 11 AM and new people come at 3 PM. So if surgery takes longer than expected and the patient unexpectedly needs to go to the ICU, a room would sit empty for hours. That backs up the ER and other units.",2024-04-11T23:41:43+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kz6ayup,dausy,,"This is a long point of contention and I assure you staff in preop and pacu ask these same questions every day but long gone are the days where you can get a room assigned in advanced.
I’ve heard stories from older nurses where years ago they would have a pre op knee replacement or gall bladder be admitted the night prior to their surgery and get a chance to get comfortable and settled in their room.

When I was a baby nurse over a decade ago it was rare to sometimes get a direct admit from the office but we did have assigned rooms. We knew what patients would be coming to what room and when.

But it hasn’t been that way in a long time, especially after Covid. I’ve worked for several different hospitals and it’s always going to be hospital dependent but beds will not be assigned until the patient is stable in pacu. That way if an emergent ER patient comes in they can get a bed first if needed. There’s also the guestimation of what patients will be discharged from the floors but that doesn’t always happen as expected. Sometimes other previously scheduled surgeries go bad and that 24 hour observation patient is hospitalized for a week so now your bed is taken. Hospitals are not in the business of holding patients a spot for the unknown. 

I think it’s also a bit of a money grab for the hospital. Fill the floors with ER patients, fill ER with more patients and the patients in pacu are obviously going to have nursing care so it’s like *poof* that is your creation of more beds (can also potentially bill you insurance more for higher level of nursing care). I assure you pacu nurses don’t want to try and keep their holds occupied for that long either. It’s an uncomfortable environment for everyone. There’s also no privacy. 

Also just nurse staffing levels. Sometimes we technically have enough beds but there’s no staff. It is not uncommon for nursing units to close down because there’s no staff to open it. Sometimes the nurses who are working have too many patients or too many high acuity patients, it’s too dangerous to assign them another. 

Then you have things like unexpected room problems. Bed bugs, biotechnical issues or some surprise contagion that requires a room be blockaded off.",2024-04-12T02:12:40+00:00

Healthcare,comment,kyw88lo,paradocs21,,"Whoa! As the other comments mentioned but worse. 

**OptumRx** is a subdivision or wholly owned part of **United Healthcare**, the largest commercial health insurer in the US. United Healthcare's main purpose is to maximize profits not provide the best health care. At the end of 2023 Optum employed or managed 90,000 physicians - or 10% of all the docs in the USA. In 2023 **Interqual** helped United Healthcare achieve a **$22,000,000,000 profit**. (Mostly money paid in premiums for medical services and/or diverted from providing care.) 

OptumRx, a ""pharmacy benefits manager"" **(PBM**), is the part of United Healthcare you are referencing. PBMs were set up to negotiate prices with Pharma, manage RX affairs for insurance companies and pharmacies and save money for patients through negotiations. Now, as a part of the very insurance company it is supposed to negotiate with, it establishes what RX are available to you on your formulary, how much you will pay for them, as well as how and where you can obtain them. This peculiar system, called vertical integration, is a total scam. It has been allowed to exist due to regulatory lapses by the FTC. (The FTC totally and legally dismantled a similar system in 1997.) Integral to the PBM are ""rebates,"" in common parlance kickbacks or bribes, which the PBM negotiates. PBMs often put the most expensive similar RX on its formulary because then the ""rebate"" from the pharma manufacturer is larger. PBMs helped fuel the drug abuse epidemic by keeping Oxycontin on formularies when Purdue raised their ""rebates."" Also you can see how PBMs squeeze local independent pharmacies by the power to cut what they are paid as well as diverting RX to a mail order system.

Remember, OptumRx takes or gives rebates to its boss, United Healthcare with virtually no savings going to patients. That is the worst part.",2024-04-10T08:36:19+00:00

Spread pricing is probably more harmful to consumers I would assume (though I haven't researched) that PBMs keep all of that money.   That spread does get added into the premium development because it is part of the net/total cost insurers are paying for claims.  What's worse is if the insurer owns the PBM, the profit would be siphoned off under another legal entity but premiums wouldn't have to be reduced accordingly.

I was in the exam room prior to the procedure and we talked about the endoscopy to several nurses, mentioned heartburn, they said nothing.

After the exam I was called back and I asked him if his throat was sore, nurse says nothing. 

Dr. Comes in and goes over colonoscopy screening,  all good.

It was super bizarre that nobody once when we were talking about the endoscopy when we first got there said anything  to correct us. And our mailing clearly states both.

Thinking  about it today: we applied to their financial  aid through the hospital  and due to our income and dependents were qualified for about 90% bill forgiveness.  We have private insurance,  the colonoscopy  was covered as a screening ( and no polyps were found so they made money on that). However,  the endoscopy would have cost them, as we have a 1k deductible  we have not touched yet. Did they deceive us and not do the endoscopy  because they wouldn't  have made money on it?

A screening colonoscopy is different, in that it's a much lower risk procedure, and usually doesn't require a full consultation to do.

It may be best to contact the GI and inquire why the endoscopy ""suggested"" by the PCP was not performed.

Healthcare,comment,kykgdig,somehugefrigginguy,,"A lot of it is true. Medical billing is kind of like a used car lot. The sales people know that customers are going to try to negotiate down the price, so they said an artificially high price so that the negotiated price is actually enough to keep the lights on. This leaves cash payers in a difficult spot. But the real issue is that the insurance companies do their best not to cover anything leaving patients in a tough spot. 

I think it's important to differentiate between actual spending on healthcare, and healthcare costs. The insurance companies make a huge profit. America spends a ton of money on health care, but a lot of that money goes to insurance company executives/shareholders and profit margins for other companies that participate in the process. There's also a ton of overhead just to manage the billing. Insurance companies require specific things in their documentation, you have to use the right words, include the right number of tests, etc. This means that American healthcare providers require huge departments just to comb through the records and ensure the documentation matches the requirements for each individual patients health care plan. 

There are also a lot of stupid rules that the insurance companies put in place to make the process more difficult. For example, I've had patients who have tests that show that they require oxygen, but the insurance company requires that the patient has face-to-face visit with a physician 30 days prior to a home oxygen order being placed. I can't tell you the number of times I've had to have a patient come back for an office visit just to meet that requirement even though the testing clearly shows they require oxygen. I've also seen countless patients who have to remain in the hospital to receive treatments that could easily be done at home for less money, but the insurance company won't cover the particular medication for home use.",2024-04-08T03:12:02+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kyjn9wz,halfNelson89,,"So, it’s partly true. The charge master, yeah 100% that’s real. You set your price, but the insurance pretty much tells you what it’s going to pay. It’s not really a “hey we’re gonna pay you 50%, so raise your prices” but you charge all of the insurance companies the same rate, some pay ~90% some pay ~ 20%. If I don’t charge enough I’m essentially leaving money on the table.

It’s 100% a scam to prevent people from paying cash. If we had a cash pay system, hospitals couldn’t raise their prices and insurance companies wouldn’t have a purpose.

We don’t spend the most per capita on health insurance because of this though, our care is the best in the world. There’s a reason hospitals like HSS, UPMC, and Cleveland Clinic have private floors for overseas cash customers… it’s because the wealthiest people in the world come here for the best care in the world.

We spend more per capita and have worse societal health outcomes because we’re BY FAR the most unhealthy country in the world. Our food is poison, less than 1:5 have a gym membership and even fewer than that actually go. There are almost as many people in the US with Diabetes.

We use more healthcare than any other country in the world.",2024-04-07T23:53:14+00:00

* Telemedicine and telehealth solutions:  To deliver remote healthcare services in rural and underserved areas.
* AI-powered virtual assistants: To provide personalized responses, information, and medical advice 24/7.
* Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM): To analyze data from wearable devices, enabling doctors to monitor patients remotely and intervene proactively.

Also, you will find many healthcare providers using AI powered chatbots to streamline administrative tasks and enhance efficiency in the healthcare workflow. This frees up the organization’s time to focus on more pressing tasks that require the human touch. 

For example, you'll find providers using telemedicine platforms like Teladoc, Doximity, SimplePractice and QuickBlox. These are some of the most renowned platforms that offer AI features to facilitate secure remote healthcare delivery and personalized care. In fact, QuickBlox has its very own AI SmartChat Assistant that can be trained in the local database of a healthcare organization or practice. This provides users with specific information tailored to the services offered by the healthcare provider.

Healthcare,post,1bxevhf,poopypants1024,"[WI] Urgent help needed: Dad retired, mom isn't eligible for Medicaid, charged $300/day for care","Hi all, thanks for reading. Trying to quickly get caught up with Medicaid and healthcare options, so any help or guidance would be appreciated.

Mom lives in an assisted-living facility due to MS, and needs 16 hours a day of care. The home charges $300/day for this care, which was previously covered by Medicaid. I'm not entirely sure how she qualified for Medicaid before while my dad was working, but something has changed now that he's retired and has access to his annuity/IRA - there's technically too much in the account now to qualify for Medicaid, but it's nowhere near enough to sustain paying for this assisted living facility at $8k/month.

Are there any other avenues we could look at to solve this? It's way too much money to feasibly afford out of pocket. They're looking at divorce as an option. Not sure if switching to Medicare is a possibility, or if any other state/federal assistance programs could help with this.",2024-04-06T15:54:47+00:00

Healthcare,comment,kyestfd,floridianreader,,"It's the Assisted Living community. Because assisted living is what the title says it is, which is basically (senior) living with (minor) assistance. Assisted Living is for people who maybe need to be reminded to take their medicine, or need some other small bit of help. When your parent can't take care of herself in an assisted living community, it's time to go somewhere else. 

If she requires round the clock care, a nursing home is the next step. Move her out of the Assisted Living community and to a nursing home that takes medicaid. Not all nursing homes will take Medicaid, so you'll have to make some phone calls. Nursing homes are significantly less expensive because they already know that their patients require round the clock care, or they wouldn't be there. 

Your current problem is that you're using an Assisted Living facility as a nursing home. 

Medicare won't pay for nursing homes except under very specific circumstances; Your mom would have to have been an inpatient at a hospital for three days or more and then discharged straight to the nursing home. In this situaion, Medicare will pay for 99 days of nursing home care. Typically Medicaid is arranged to start on day 100. 

If this is still too much, then consider bringing Mom home and having a home health agency provide nursing care in the home. They charge by the hour with a set minimum number of hours per week. And most take Medicaid. 

The income problem with Medicaid is that if your parents have a lot of money in IRAs, bonds, etc, the government expects them to ""spend that money down."" Basically in plain terms: use up all of the money you have been saving for retirement (This IS retirement). When that money is gone or seriously depleted, Medicaid will be there to pick up the bills. 

Do NOT under ANY circumstances try to spend that IRA money by gifting it to other family members or shuffling the money into another account. The government requires a five year lookback period for Medicaid eligibility; basically they look at 5 years of all of your financial history starting from the time you first apply for Medicaid. If you applied for Medicaid today, the clock would start today and go all the way back to April 2019. They are looking specifically for large amounts of money disappearing, like it would if the money was gifted to someone. If they find that you have been shuffling money around or gifting it to someone, they restart the clock from the date of the money transfer. And you could get in trouble for fraud, for applying to Medicaid while knowingly shuffling money around. Just don't do it. 

Bottom Line: Use up that savings. It's meant for retirement, and now is retirement. It doesn't get more retirement-y. Apply for medicaid, and be honest. They will see that you are using your savings to pay for medical stuff and whatever. And when your income reaches the number they're looking for, they will approve you and start paying. 

And take Mom out of the Assisted Living community. They're soaking you for that money. A nursing home is much more appropriate in this situation.

We had in-home care for many years and it mostly worked, but it was becoming difficult to reliably staff shifts and get people trained/comfortable with hoyer lift operation, etc, so decision was eventually made to move her to a group home where staff was always available.

Healthcare,comment,ky7g3pu,OnlyInAmerica01,,"It has. Anyone who works in healthcare will tell you that the hay-days of the ACA were when the government subsidies were robust, and adequately accounted for cost of care delivery.  As those have been taken away, the healthcare infrastructure has been surviving on moment, with steady attrition of healthcare personnel (in addition to ""quiet-quitting""/lower productivity as people get more burnt out).  COVID was a double-edge sword.  On the one hand, there was rallying amongst healthcare workers to fight this once-in-a-generation medical ""war"".  ALso, from a cost POV, it was by most accounts, a huge cost savings, since other than emergent needs, people mostly delayed/avoided medical care, so payers (especially Medicare and Medicaid) saved a ton.  On the other hand,  it massively highlighted the issues with current healthcare, especially that it's infrastructure has been collapsing for years, and really mostly held together by the good-will of healthcare workers.

The majority of healthcare workers felt used and abused during the 3 years of COVID, both by the healthcare system and by angry patients, which lead to further attrition post-COVID, with many systems seeing an eflux of 20-30% of their physician and nursing staff, early retirements, reduced hours, etc.

The best way to summarize the slow-motion collapse of the U.S. healthcare system post ACA is the famous line:

Healthcare,post,1bvve0b,diesel_51,Make it make sense,"I went to urgent care a few weeks ago for a wrist/hand injury. The PA came and looked at it for about 2 minutes, then sent me for x-rays, came back and told me it wasn’t broken and sent me on my way. 

That 2 minutes in the room with me and then maybe 10 minutes to examine the x-rays was billed as 99203 (30-44 min office visit) for $357 dollars. 

The description of the code does state that any time used to review my medical charts/history etc. counts towards the time spent with me. And I don’t know what the PA was doing when they weren’t in the room. But it seems HIGHLY unlikely that they actually spent 30-44 minutes working with me. The PA and I were only in the exam room together for a grand total of MAYBE 5 minutes. 

It’s just mind boggling that I’m getting charged $357 for about 5 minutes of time.

Office visits are billed by time OR medical decision making (think complexity). 99203 does sound correct for your visit. 

Billed amount doesn’t matter, it’s the insurance contracted rate that does. They could bill a million dollars if they wanted to technically, and it wouldn’t change how much you or your insurance pays. 

Last thing, that payment also covers overhead, staff, rent, equipment, etc.

Sounds like they billed it appropriately.  The only other thing I can say is that they aren't charging YOU $357, that's the amount they bill your insurance, and then the actual amount that gets paid is contractually reduced to an agreed-upon rate.

Tbh MOST providers don’t know the intricacies of insurance and reimbursement. They don’t know how much insurance is going to say the visit costs. They don’t cover any of that stuff in medical school. 

Providers don’t know what specific insurance patients have or how much it will cost them. They don’t think about that when providing care. 

Don’t take any of what I said as *defending* the system, because I’m not. I’m explaining the reality of it. 

And the reality is that there’s a sizable population that don’t care about this because they have good coverage where there’s minimal patient financial responsibility. And the policy makers are either on Medicare (which they vote to not expand) or on that sweet sweet federal comprehensive health plan. 

It is a systemic issue. Universal healthcare is *scary* because long wait times I guess. Or reduced doctor participation? Idk, most doctors take Medicare. 

But that’s only an issue for those that already have access to cheap (for them) healthcare. Anyone else not lucky enough to be on a great plan or not qualify for Medicare still do not receive affordable care.

Healthcare,comment,ky93zoa,SobeysBags,,"Having lived in countries with single payer my whole life I can see how possible it is, even with entrenched systems in place. Hell,.my family in Canada were just introduced to universal dental and pharmacare, which is being rolled out over the next 1-2 years. Canada never had dental or pharma coverage included in their single payer systems, a huge oversight. Dental and pharmaceutical companies had big interest in keeping the status quo, but people wanted universal coverage, and most importantly pharmacists, dentists and doctors wanted universal care to help patients. Lobby groups representing medical professionals clashed with big pharma and corporate dental interests, and luckily won. Now Canadians will be getting full dental coverage free at point of service if they make less than 70 grand, and free major prescription medications. This will be expanded as the years go on.

This doesn't happen in the USA, there is no strong medical professional lobby pushing govt to move towards single payer, even though it is cheaper,.more efficient and better for business. This is the way forward, fighting fire with fire and medical professionals need their representative bodies involved. 

It can seem hopeless,.but it really isn't and the USA is neither unique nor a lost cause. Every country that switched to a universal model had a brutal money driven system before making the switch, some worse than the USA, but they made it happen. They did this by making all parties involved, doctors, patients, lobby groups, politicians etc with a clear mandate and focus.

Healthcare,comment,kypi9sg,hotsexiyetta,,"A few things come to mind:
1. Billed rates are different from what is actually paid. So $357 is billed, commercial insurance has negotiated a 60% discount for example, pays $100 of that and passes the last $43 to the patient to pay. Final cost to the patient is significantly lower than the billed rate. Self-pay (non-insured) often has an automatic 50% discount applied.

2. High deductible insurance plans are getting more popular, which are generally a good bet if you are a healthy person but can be quite expensive if you need to go to the ER or have imaging done, because that’s the plan selected.

3. Commercially insured patients cover the cost of care of non-insured or governmentally insured patients. I have seen 4% reimbursement for certain procedures from Medicaid, meaning the hospital charges $1000 and Medicaid pays $40. So commercial patients have to make up the difference to keep the hospital open.

4. Hospitals are consolidating all over the country because they can’t stay open at a 2-5% profit margin. The cost of care is very high and acuity seems to be getting higher, meanwhile insurance and PBMs are seeing bigger and bigger profit margins.",2024-04-09T01:46:53+00:00

It comes down to what you feel comfortable paying monthly and how prepared you are to cover unexpected medical bills in an emergency.  I have a family of 5 with 2 kids with asthma.  We have a PPO so that unplanned visits are not so expensive.",2024-04-04T10:42:52+00:00

Healthcare,comment,kxyld9f,warfrogs,,"The people talking about ACA non-compliance are completely off-base.

Reference: I'm a licensed agent in 5 states, I don't do sales - I'm in regulatory compliance and work for a regional insurer. I don't specialize in commercial plans, but I've written up a lot of documentation for them.

There's a lot of factors at play as to why the cost may be higher for your wife, and why it may be higher (and legally so) for female employees; [ERISA](https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/elg/erisa.htm) does not contain a sex/gender non-discrimination clause for large, self-insured group plans. These plans may legally charge more for monthly premiums. I suspect your plan is governed not by the ACA but by ERISA, as are most folks on large-group employer policies.

On these plans, the employer pays on all claims, the insurer handles contract negotiations, network administration, and sometimes regulatory compliance - acting largely as a Third Party Administrator. Due to the higher costs that women tend to experience throughout their lives in requiring higher levels of ongoing care (which is why OBGYNs are considered Primary Care Providers to reduce office visit loads), employers are allowed to charge them higher monthly premiums.

That does not mean you're entitled to ACA ATCP subsidies UNLESS the plan does not meet the Minimum Essential Coverage (edit - oops, combined the two into one) and Minimum Average Value criteria. It's rare but not entirely unheard of and you can oftentimes check on this through the DOL - EBSA administers those plans and can point you in the right direction.

You may notice that while the cost for your wife being added to the plan *is* higher, it matches the cost for a wife adding her husband - interestingly enough, they don't account for same sex couples which I find a bit odd, but that *usually* means that childbirthing expenses don't have to be added to the risk pool, so *maybe* that's it? Because your wife is not an employee, any premium subsidization that your employer offers is not extended to her, so whatever amount of your monthly premium is part of your benefits does *not* extend to her.

Anyways, the added amount for your wife is the full cost of an unsubsidized policy under your plan; while it's a bit high, it's not that wild. 

You may still want to check to see if it meets the Minimum Essential Value requirement - if not, you can get a waiver through the DOL/EBSA (again, not my area of expertise) and that will grant you an SEP and ACA subsidies appropriate to your household income. You may also be entitled to Medicaid, but that greatly depends on your household income and your state.

I'd also suggest posting over on /r/HealthInsurance rather than this sub for a better answer if you want one; like I said, this isn't my area of expertise, but pretty much everyone responding to you is off-base. This sub can sometimes be good for some basic medical practice stuff and general news, but it's awful for insurance questions - there's a lot of people who aren't *actually* involved in health insurance (patients who have had issues, medical billers, coders, etc - thankfully infrequently, but not unheard of, a physician) but believe that their tertiary experience with the revenue cycle makes them experts in health insurance rather than their specific portion of it.

Healthcare,comment,kxyukbn,Beatszzz,,"This ^^ 
There are ways for employer medical plans to get by some of the rating restrictions of the ACA, which is limited to individual and small group plans. If this is a large group plan and/or self-insured, you have more flexibility in rating options, but from your perspective there’s no way to no what type of group plan it is, but we can assume it’s not an ACA small group plan. 

Regardless, to answer your question on cost being reasonable, it really depends on how rich the benefits are for the plan. But for a standard insurance non-high deductible plan, yes, health care costs at commercial rates (not Medicare or Medicaid) are in the range of $300-$500/month for adults these days. The jump is much larger adding your spouse because your employer is covering less of her premium than yours (likely none of hers). 

You could look at the ACA marketplace, but I generally don’t think you’ll find substantially better deals there, though you will find more options to cater to your healthcare needs. I did see your joint income may be low enough to qualify for a premium subsidy (must be under 250% if federal poverty level) or a cost sharing reduction subsidy (must be under 400% if FPL). But I think those subsidies only apply also if your employer coverage is more than 9.5% of your income (which it may be, I didn’t do the math for you). It’s quite complicated, but wouldn’t be a bad idea to seriously explore an ACA plan, but no your healthcare cost isn’t unreasonable at surface level. Honestly, this is why I have seen some people stay unmarried for a while, so their non-working spouse can get Medicaid for free and they only have to pay for their employer subsidized health care premium.",2024-04-04T04:31:08+00:00

Healthcare,comment,kxo307d,paradocs21,,"You betcha! Few people are aware that in health insurance created HMO's and ""narrow networks"" of providers, many ER physicians were able to remain fiscally independent and not join or have contracts with the groups created by insurance companies that limited their provider networks (including Medicare Advantage). Their services are often absolutely necessary and unavoidable. A person with a medical emergency does not have time (or often the ability) to check if the doc is on his insurance list or not. In fact, a hospital may be ""in network"" but its ER docs, pathologists, and anesthesiologists (who are not actually hospital employees) may not be. This ""independence"" let them charge and get paid much more than the insurance companies allowed. Thus lots of ""suprise bills"" for patients and better income for the docs. Well, along comes private equity (PE) which can smell extra income (rents) from system manipulation a mile away and they want in. Thus they have been gobbling up ER medical groups and ER management itself. This hurts you more than in the pocketbook because there have been lots of ER doc complaints that PE maximizes profit by short-staffing ERs.

Healthcare,comment,kxrmmdq,Professional-Try7866,,"The evidence of how acquisition of healthcare providers/facilities by private equity companies impacts prices/cost of care, quality of care, competition, communities etc. is not difficult to find. PE companies are almost always motivated/energized to acquire businesses with good cashflows and great assets. You can find all of these in healthcare organizations (provider groups, nursing homes, dental groups etc.).

Long story short: The typical playbook of PE companies has always been to acquire the organization by often putting down minimal capital and using debt to finance these deals. In most cases the deals are structured in such a manner that the assets of the acquired organization is used as collateral for that debt financing. After the acquisition, the next phase is usually to increase the revenue of the organization (by cutting costs in the name of implementing improvements and efficiency; hiking the cost of products or services especially in areas where they have market dominance. Once revenues are up, they almost always spinoff that organization or parts of that entity to make good money in deals usually structured and completed based on the new revenues the organization is producing.

Little concern is often given to the quality of care or how the changes the new management (PE) has made will impact patient care (both for providers and patients) and care outcomes for patients.

On the other hand, I am certain that PE companies will not seat down, fold their arms and let the senate take away their lunch without giving it a good fight. I am sure PE companies  will hire lobbyists who will show evidence after evidence why PE acquisitions (""investments"") are good for healthcare and the communities they operate in. Even if the senate does something about it like policy changes or legislation, I am not very optimistic about the outcome of this process.

Lobbyists always have a way to make legislators inject clauses or provisions that spare their clients the full impact of the legislation often watering it down and creating loopholes for their clients to continue exploiting it without triggering a violation of the law.

But we will wait and see how it goes. I have worked in healthcare for more than 10 years now, I understand healthcare policy and how healthcare works/operates. I'll be happy to do a detailed research on this topic and share my findings with this group. But I want to see if there's any interest in it before I invest my time doing it.

Healthcare,comment,kxqvu1u,paradocs21,,"SEE:  PE acquisitions of physician practices are increasing. We find that private equity (PE) firms have been increasingly acquiring physician practices across a number of physician specialties since 2012, increasing from 75 deals in 2012 to 484 deals in 2021, or more than six-fold increase in only 10 years.  
● PE firms are amassing high market shares in local physician practice markets. At the local level, we find that individual PE firms are acquiring competitively significant shares of physician practice markets. In particular, in 28% of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), a single PE firm has more than 30% market share by full-time-equivalent physicians, and in 13% of MSAs, the single PE firm market share exceeds 50%.  
● PE acquisitions are associated with price and expenditure increases. In 8 of the 10 physician practice specialties we study, we find statistically significant price increases associated with PE’s acquisition of a practice. These price increases range from 16% in oncology to 4% in primary care and dermatology. PE acquisitions are also associated with per-patient expenditure increases for 6 of 10 specialties, ranging from 4% to 16% depending on the specialty.  
● Price increases associated with PE acquisitions are exceptionally high where a PE firm controls a competitively significant share of the local market. When we focus our analysis on markets where a single PE firm controls more than 30% of the market, we find further elevated prices associated with PE acquisitions in each of the 3 specialties with statistically significant results, for gastroenterology (18%), obstetrics and gynecology (16%), and dermatology (13%).  
● Increased attention to the competition impacts of PE in physician markets is urgently needed. The vast majority of the PE acquisitions studied in this report took place without federal antitrust scrutiny and with limited state antitrust scrutiny. The market share and price results reported here indicate that more scrutiny is warranted on PE’s impact on competition. The pace at which PE is entering these markets and monetizing medicine makes a quick response imperative.  
● Changes to Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) requirements, reimbursement policies, and tax policies are needed. At a minimum, federal antitrust reporting requirements must be adapted to modern business models, including PE, to ensure regulators have the information they need to evaluate the competition impacts of these deals. The FTC has recently begun that process, which we applaud. HSR changes alone, however, are not enough, and we also recommend changes to Medicare reimbursement policy and tax policies that are driving consolidation and PE opportunism.

Healthcare,post,1btlog7,graphicnovel10,Valid Safety Concern?,"Hey! 

I want the opinions of the masses before I bring this up.

I work at state and federal skilled nursing facility as a RN. 

We frequently work 16s at least once a week due to mandated hours. 

We get half an hour unpaid lunches. However, on NOC shift we cannot leave the building. 

Management downsized our break room and removed all couches or loveseat that someone could cat nap on. In addition, we all got memos about how we cannot take breaks in the lobby of the facility or shared spaces of patients and families. 

I frequently try to nap on my unpaid 30 min breaks- but now I can't per my management rules. Other staff are upset as well, but we are told sleeping, even during breaks, is not condoned. I would go to my car- but I can't on NOC shift. 

Is this a valid concern? Can I try to fight this? If needed could this be considered an employee health situation with OSHA? 

I just want some formulated opinions before I make my decision. ",2024-04-02T01:07:01+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kxmultc,tomqvaxy,,This would be a good question for r/legaladvice as I’m unsure if you can be told how to use your breaks but I’m not an expert and I’m sure it varies state to state. Mention your state or they’ll ask.,2024-04-02T01:25:50+00:00

1. If the issue of sleep deprivation is posing a health issue (e.g., employee injuries due to mistakes because of sleep deprivation like needle sticks, etc) then OSHA could potentially handle the issue. There are no specific OSHA regulations for sleep deprivation, but it could be handled under what would be called a “general duty” violation.

2. Your best bet is to contact your state’s agency for wage and hour claims as such divisions usually handle questions of breaks, compensation, etc.

You can always file a complaint with OSHA. Worst thing is they could send you a letter saying they can’t cover that issue and to contact your relevant wage/hour division or they could open an inspection and go onsite.",2024-04-02T23:11:37+00:00

I also have chronic health issues that this relieves a lot of financial worry. In addition, the retirement benefits are outstanding. Other RNs are retiring at 55.

I saved all these memos in a file in case it ever comes back up. 

It's an odd place to work—- you just have to watch your back. I'm going to try to ignore the “rules” when the big wigs aren't looking (like NOCs and PMs). I just struggle with it because I'm the type to follow rules to the T- even if they seem stupid (unless those rules are dangerous).",2024-04-02T23:50:39+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kxs7jpr,Competitive-Bug-7870,,"OSHA has really good anonymity options. When I receive a complaint to open an inspection for and the complainant has chosen to remain anonymous, I don’t even get to see the name of who filed the complaint. So as long as you don’t spread the fact that you filed among coworkers who may spill the beans, you can remain anonymous.

Also, under 1977.4-15 for federal osha states and many state plan states, it is illegal to discharge or discriminate against an employee for filing complaints etc. and can result in additional legal action against the company. Many state plan states have employee discrimination sections that specialize in these issues and federal plan states are covered by 1981.103.

So employers certainly can play the game of retaliation but it is an increasingly dumb one to play given the scrutiny around the issue, protections from employees and the anonymity options for complainants. For example, an employer simply asking employees who filed the complaint can be enough evidence of retaliation if the complainant is later terminated for an unrelated issue. Just make sure you file any discrimination claims within 30 days of the alleged discrimination.",2024-04-03T00:38:37+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kxs2y0d,QuantumHope,,"I hear ya but I’ve found (with age) that rules should be tempered with common sense. 

Perhaps you could approach your employer by saying since you aren’t getting paid but you’re on site, you should be able to make that time your own, including a brief nap. You could point out the fact that just having a short amount of downtime helps to refresh you and that can only help your job performance. 

Did your employer explain why they don’t want you taking a nap on your own time? Are you the only RN on duty during the night shift? If so, they really should be paying you for the entire time you’re there. Since you don’t have a union, don’t you at least have some form of employee representation? Even the cheap ass company I used to work for provided that. 

As for HR, most of the time they are useless as they’re in their position to look out for the employer. 

Two suggestions others have made that I agree with are contacting OSHA (can’t hurt) and look for another job that doesn’t take advantage of you because your current employer is definitely doing that.",2024-04-03T00:09:33+00:00

Some background.

The stigma that a DO is not as qualified as an MD stems from marketing more than anything. MD medical schools sought to discredit institutions that awarded a DO to ensure that the MD was considered more elite. DO training includes everything that an MD learns, but they also learn about Osteopathic Manipulation, which was considered quackery for a long time.

Understand that there are any number of variables that affect a person's ability to gain acceptance into, or desire to attend, an M.D. vs a D.O. program, and practically, IMO, it has no bearing on their abilities as a physician.  One simple example is state of residence.  California and New York are the two most competitive states to gain medical school acceptance, mostly due to the massive # of applicants hoping for an in-state education (much more affordable). As a result, the average college GPA and MCAT scores of California applicants are significantly higher than other states (last I checked, the average college GPA of an ***accepted*** applicant in Georgia was below 3.0). 

So sometimes, it's a simple as ""I can go out of state and get an M.D., or stay in-state and get a D.O."".  Just one of many reasons that equally capable people might choose slightly different (but ultimately convergent) paths.",2024-04-01T23:31:36+00:00

Healthcare,comment,kxle8bx,DrMonteCristo,,"DO here. Not entirely true. I'll reiterate what most here have said--DOs generally follow the same licensure and board-certification path as MD's. But you'll find that most of the time, both good MD's and DO's will lean into trying to address lifestyle changes and the ""easy"" fixes before prescribing a medication or recommending a surgery.

Before I went to a DO medical school, I also believed osteopathic medicine represented the more holistic approach. But this is more provider-dependent than school-dependent. I was essentially taught allopathic medicine with extra classes on OMT (some overlap with hands-on skills of PTs), because at the end of the day the licensing exams can be difficult, and schools focus on getting students to excel in those. 95%+ of DO's do not use OMT in their clinical practice.

They pick whatever product they want and the hospital pays the bill. The surgeon is almost always in deep a sales rep, who makes more on those sales than the surgeon.

Healthcare,comment,kxq7nn8,Tavish42,,"This issue mostly applies to expensive implants. Some examples are spine implants, hip and knee replacements, pacemakers, internal defibrillators, and neurostimulators.  It is very hard to negotiate any prices on these implants because the surgeon has all the say in what they use. They are accountable for patient outcomes and their reimbursement is separate from hospital reimbursement. The price of the implant is very low on the priority list. Surgeons have their preferences which instantly kills any form of price competition. 

My experiences with contract negotiation was about 10 years ago so there is a chance that there is more cooperation between surgeons and hospitals to attempt to have some control of implant pricing. Most surgeons are not hospital employees. Every hospital is different but I witnessed a lot of vendors taking advantage of surgeons and this disconnect to charge whatever they want.

If you compare this to hiring a contractor to renovate your kitchen they will likely work with you to pick out an oven. Price, functionality, and aesthetic will be discussed and you pick the product, you’re paying for it after all. This scenario has room for price competition in ovens. A pacemaker is much more important than an oven, lives are at stake. But we cannot assume that competition among vendors is the same here as it is with ovens. If your electrocardiologist is a “Medtronic man” that is the only option and price competition is dead.

Healthcare,post,1bsqsoz,cherophobia13,Absolutely miserable with new healthcare job. Not sure what steps I should take.   ,"Hi,

I (33/F) started a new job in January in Healthcare (NY, USA). It's for one of the larger hospital systems. I was hired as an admin assistant for $22.50 with no experience in Healthcare but plenty of experience in admin work and handling people. The doctor I specifically assist and am the only assistant to, has thousands of patients, is booked out until the end of the year, and never stops taking new patients. In an office of 3 medical professionals, he is the only general physician so every inquiry goes to me for a new patient. I schedule appointments, call to confirm appointments, get authorizations for patients scripts, organize and send out messages from patients, take voice-mails and calls from current patients and new. This may not sound like a lot, but the time it takes for some authorizations to be completed or process, getting medical staff to complete letters, calls for results, filling prescriptions, calling pharmacies and insurance companies, calling patients who keep you on the phone, calling new patients to tell them there's no space on the calendar, moving an entire week of patients and figuring out where to move them because the doctor will no longer be in, getting emails from your boss to find a spot in an already booked week for a VIP...this all takes a lot of time and the work/stress is really not worth the pay. 

On top of that there is a lot of chatting, gossiping and down time(scrolling on cell phones and personal laptops) for multiple other employees in the office. This goes on while myself and a few others, including the doctors, are badly swamped with work and calls. Work is not properly allocated between positions, but it doesn't seem to bother management.

Patients call constantly upset that they are still waiting on a call from the doctor to get results, so every few days I'm screamed at. I don't mind this too much but my biggest issue is that it's impossible to help everyone. It's something that makes me uncomfortable because patient care is actually important to me. I was told I am the 15th assistant to this doctor in 7 years if that tells you anything. Multiple patients have told me I'm made for this job and they haven't had help like this from this office in a long time. My boss also gave me a great review (which has still not made it into my file) with no criticisms. However she's been driving me insane and picking on me for strange things. It's all very confusing but the doctor even told her I've been nothing but great and he keeps hearing it from the patients. 
 
Here is where I am asking for opinions. When I had first spoken to a talent acquisition coordinator for the job, they verbally told me I would get a raise after my probation period ending mid April. I have now learned this was incorrect and I will be stuck making 22.50 for a year. I am incredibly miserable and have never experienced this so quickly at a job. I've had shitty jobs before but this one tops them all. This is also the first job to offer benefits, Healthcare and 401k, although I'm not sure how great it is. I'd really hate to quit but I was told I can't transfer or apply within until after a year. It took me so long with job searching to get something and it's even more upsetting because I was so excited to get into this company. I really don't know what to do. I haven't even figured out what I want to do as a career, but I know I want to help people. I do love that part of my job when I can actually help. HR did tell me that I could attempt to get my boss to agree to let me go sooner (at least 6 months) so I can apply within, but im afraid how that may turn out. Do I try to hold out for the year? Should I start applying to other companies again? I'm tired of getting sick every night because I have to go to work. I hate that I cry most days over being there. I'm really at a loss. Any guidance or advice would be lovely. I'm getting older and I really want a career. I already feel like I messed up my chance to have one because I can't seem to find a good fit.

I went through the whole normal procedure of transferring all my stuff over, however my old states insurance refuses to answer any calls, emails, or messages and when they do they won't cancel my insurance. It's been over a year now of contacting them and trying to get new insurance but they still see the old one is still active.
I'm also afraid of going back to my old state to do medical stuff due to feeling like I shouldnt be able to living in another state, as well as my primary doctors won't see me since they are afraid of losing their licences seeing someone out of state.

Has anyone else dealt with this? I'm so lost and scared and I desperately need a surgery soon but they just won't get back to me on anything.",2024-03-31T20:00:59+00:00

Healthcare,comment,kximylu,paradocs21,,"When they say ""worked"" they mean Obamacare got a lot of people health insurance. As commercial health insurance gets more and more expensive, with huge, growing out of pocket costs, many folks are turning to Obamacare. Health insurance is not necessarily health care. As designed it was essentially a pass through of a lot of taxpayer money to the states and to insurance companies to subsidize insurance. In its main population, there was no cost control except high out of pocket costs - especially huge deductibles. It worked because almost 90% of enrollees had their premiums, co-pays and deductibles largely subsidized with tax money and a new tax on stock transactions (which Republicans soon eliminated). Lobbyists prevented any cost controls, so insurers and medical providers laughed all the way to the bank. It also tried to expand Medicaid with huge federal subsidies to create universal insurance and medical care for some of the poorest citizens, mainly unemployed men. This innovation was sharply curtailed by the Republican Supreme Court and 10 Republican states continue to refuse to do this in spite of the economic boon it would provide to the state and the benefits to its citizens.

In sum, the compromises with health insurance companies, pharma, and medical providers threw a lot of tax money into the system to gain coverage for a relatively few Americans, while keeping the exploitive financialization of the medical-industrial complex intact. It is a very expensive band aid and not a cure for a poorly functioning system.",2024-04-01T08:35:34+00:00

But my boss and husband thought i was dying, so they made me. 
 
 But now I'm stuck with a 2k medical bill for the second one and a 800 dollar for the 1st. I haven't been able to pay either, because they didn't send me the bill for the first one until like a week ago, and I'm just poor. I just had to decide whether I should buy food or pay my car insurance. 

 So now, the $800 got sent to a debt collections agency and I'm getting really scared they're going to sue me. I don't care if they mess up my credit, I just turned 20, it doesn't matter.

 But I don't want to mess up my Fiancees life if a lean gets put on any of our stuff. I'm not on insurance because my parents kicked me off theirs and my legal address is in one of the shittiest states (AL), so I don't qualify for Medicare even though I only make like 11k a year.

1. FOOD. Profit is the guiding principle, not human health. Government could regulate crap food out of existance. Can't argue, it's bullshit. Look at the calibre of political leaders this system gets us. Money out of politics.  How about when you get into office you must liquidate holdings. No stocks, no indexed funds. No revolving door between gov office and private companies. How about health school cafeterias instead of private contractors. Prisons too. Healthy food and no treats.

2. Of course we should detatch enployers from health insurance. There would be no need with gov ins. They would pay through taxes like we fund everything, the wars, bailouts to huge corporations etc. You would be fully insured cradle to grave. 

3. Funding. Isn't medicare still admistered by private companies? What a confusing mess. Government would have very little burocracy. Imagine. No insurance issues ever. Like every other major nation. Virtually. You would hope there were some guideluines. Doctors now have full time people dealing with ins companies. All gone. Just unencumbered care. If funded properly. Again, better government.

Looking at your California insurance, if you had MediCal it does not work outside the state except in unusual emergencies, maybe. If you had commercial insurance it may be limited to a specific group of included docs - all in California -except in emergencies. Medicare is good everywhere in the US (but not outside) and is national insurance for ppl over 65 and the disabled and some forms have limited doc lists, except for emergencies. 

Florida Medicaid has very specific limits (kick those poor people to the ground!). Note how low your income has to be for an adult with a dependent child to have Medicaid in Florida - **below- not over -** 26% of the federal poverty level.  This is very, very, very much lower than in California where a single person (any man or woman, no child required) can earn up to $20,783 annually and still qualify. **In Florida, if you are a human being and are not pregnant and do not have a dependent child you do not qualify at all:**

Florida Medicaid Income Limits 2024  
Children up to 1-year-old: 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL)  
Children ages 1-18: 133% of FPL  
Children under age 19 can qualify for Florida Healthy Kids, with modest monthly premiums, if household income is between 133% and 200% of FPL.

I was under my wife’s insurance at the time, but we had filed for divorce about 2 weeks prior, and were told to expect final judgment to take at least until March.  Turns out judgement came in Feb 19th, and we were notified by mail Feb 25th.  

Well, it’s over a month later now, and Cigna has just decided to go back and retroactively cancel my coverage to the judgement date, allowing them to say I wasn’t insured at the time of service and deny coverage.

At the time of the procedure, my cost was $260, and Cigna would have footed the rest, right?  Well, SimonMed is now saying that balance is $807, which seemed ridiculous.  

I called SimonMed’s scheduling department and explained the scenario, and although they couldn’t help with billing, she offered to pull the “self-pay” price for my procedure to hopefully help me out.  Turns out, the cash price (no insurance) for the exact same procedure was **drumroll**  $260.  Are you kidding me?

So, speaking to billing, they are saying my responsibility is $807, on top of the $260 I already paid.  I try to explain the situation, and I remind them that $260 is *THEIR CASH PRICE* for the procedure, and that under literally *any other circumstance* this would be considered paid in full - so billing me an additional $807 is straight up highway robbery.  But I can’t seem to get anywhere with this conversation.

It's a 3 hour drive for us to get up there only to deal with an extremely rude receptionist who outright lied to our faces. She said she tried calling her and myself, as I'm her emergency contact, the day before to let us know about the records needing to be faxed which she never did. And even if she did call the day before, it's awfully unprofessional to call the day before like that for something so important pertaining to the appointment.

Keep in mind you may have simply forgotten, but there's also a good chance they just didn't tell you. I would insist on speaking to a supervisor. From my small understanding down here, the big guys in the government or insurance companies won't take action on a relatively small complaint (compared to other complaints, such as instances of malpractice).


A supervisor would be able to review a call recording to see if you were properly communicated with, and generally you can request to speak with a supervisor. Even if you hit a voicemail, you should leave a detailed message. Generally supervisors are more invested in getting things done to look good to their higher-ups, they are in more immediate scrutiny.


Notwithstanding, how well is this clinic rated on Google Maps seriously? I find that an excellent indicator of general efficiency of clinics and other businesses. Are there other clinical options available that are accepted by your insurance? I will say, there certainly exist clinics with better communication and efficiency.


But yeah, if you actually want to stick it to that receptionist, get that receptionist's supervisor to review the call recording. If no call recording is available, I would not trust a clinic to have accountability.

Healthcare,comment,kwydng7,srmcmahon,,"&#x200B;

First of all, what was the source of your free healthcare? It sounds like while you were still a minor (for some purposes, age 19 is considered a minor in some states)--were you on Medicaid? Your parents' insurance? ACA (Obamacare) with a tax credit? Depending on what kind of insurance, you might no longer qualify for 100% free coverage based on income. 

Second, you need to learn about what your work insurance covers. Some require only a copay for an office visit (outside of tests and such), others require you to meet your deductible before they cover the office visit. 

Just because that visit cost $300 does not mean treating a more serious illness/injury will cost x times that visit. It depends on your coverage. You are definitely better off having coverage (as long as it complies with federal requirements, which it likely does) than not--even though you're young serious injuries or illness can happen. 

It's a shame that many employers require a doctor note for absence due to a minor illness (I'm guess this was your situation)--it's a drain on our healthcare system, one more thing added to the pile of stuff that makes getting in to see a primary or urgent care provider harder for everyone.",2024-03-28T13:55:25+00:00

When choosing insurance you should not purely look at your bi-weekly or whatever cadence contribution is. You need to pay attention to what it covers. The cheapest options are often high deductible plans and there’s a reason for it.",2024-03-28T14:09:53+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kwyqglg,srmcmahon,,"I should add one thing more--the bill from the doctor may or may not show what your insurance pays. It takes time for a claim to be submitted and processed. Also, even if you have to pay for the office visit the actual charge might be less that the original bill. Hopefully you gave them your insurance card at the clinic and they entered that information. Check your bill to see what it says about having submitted to insurance. Also watch for mail/email from the insurer with your EOB--explanation of benefits. That will tell you how much they paid, if any, and the reason for what they did not pay. Basically, if you have insurance, your bill is not your bill until you hear from BOTH the insurance and the doctor office. 

The other thing is find out what doctors and clinics (and hospitals) you can use under your work insurance, because most likely they require you to go to a place that is in their network.",2024-03-28T15:10:09+00:00

Healthcare,comment,kwvs7md,konqueror321,,"1. The only real gap I have experienced to date was when my dentist found an area of white discoloration of my gum (leukoplakia), which can be pre-cancerous (or not), and referred me to see an oral surgeon. He gave me the name of a local oral surgeon he trusted, I called their office, only to find out that he had ""opted out"" from medicare, and I would have to sign a 'private contract' allowing the oral surgeon to charge me whatever he desired, and medicare (and my medicare supplement) would pay NOTHING towards the care - I would be responsible for the entire bill. I said 'no thanks' and searched the medicare website for an oral surgeon within 25 miles who 'accepted' medicare. There was 1 (one) - and that was a fluke - it was an oral surgeon who worked at at a local cancer hospital and only saw patients with biopsy proven cancer who were being treated for cancer by the hospital. there were NO (NONE, ZERO) oral surgeons in the huge 1 million person standard metropolitan area where I reside who 'accepted' medicare. 

I'm a vet, so I contacted my primary care doc at the VA hospital - I'm not eligible for dental care at the VA, but leukoplakia of the gum is not technically 'dental care', so I could be seen in the VA Dental Clinic by an oral surgeon. I got good care at the VA and was quite relieved that such care was available to me. It turned out that the white color was not pre-cancerous and I was quite relieved. 

But medicare not having a single oral surgeon who could evaluate and treat a possibly precancerous gum lesion within 25 miles of my location was an eye-opener. 

2. None other that (1). I get most of my care from the VA  even though I have medicare and a supplement and a drug plan. The VA encourages beneficiaries to have medicare available in case they (the VA) cannot provide needed care. In our current crazy American health care financing system, I can see the value of having more than one source of care. 

3. If somehow medicare could ensure that providers of all specialties are actually available for medicare recipients across the country, that would be good! IDK how that could be done, 'forcing' providers to participate in medicare would be a real change from the current system, and increasing the payment to hard-to-find specialists might help but could break the bank. 

4. Again, (1). Both me and my wife are vets and so we use medicare very sparingly, but it is good to have it as a back-up -- but the cost of part B/D may become an issue in a few years when I'm forced to take required minimum distributions from retirement funds which will bump up my ""income"" and require me to pay tremendously more for medicare enrollment (that I'm generally not using!!).  These funds are not truly 'income' but are so classified by the IRS specifically to allow them to be taxed. So my wife and I will pay 3-4 times what others may pay for medicare coverage -- even though we are not using it!! Quadruple ouch.

I developed a MRSA skin infection sometime around 2005--it was showing up a lot in the community, they were cancelling h.s. wrestling matches over it. It was on my leg, I got antibiotics, they cultured it, and called to confirm it was MRSA. I was on sulfa (allergic to penicillin) and stayed on that. It returned at least once a year until 2017 (last episode was October of that year). I did decolonization and still had outbreaks for a few years. I learned to catch it early most times, but I was hospitalized once and a few episodes had me basically in bed for a week with high fever (also painful). BUt it would lie dormant for 9 to 12 months and then come back roaring. Point is, the presence of the bacteria doesn't necessarily mean you will get sick, or that you will end up with MRSA respiratory infection (which I'm inferring is the case with your patient). If you were wearing PPE I assume that means masked and gloved, so probably no more risk than you already run working in a hospital. But if you find yourself feeling unusually tired (and maybe chillled) my MRSA episodes seemed to follow a day or so of that before more obvious signs (redness or high fever).",2024-03-29T02:04:08+00:00

If you are terrified like i am, does it exist a solution where you can sign some form of documents that gives the hospital the ability to use force without consent? 
And how far can this go without it becoming unethical?",2024-03-26T15:44:32+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kwo3l62,SnooStrawberries620,,I hope you’re considering some psychiatric help around this? As you age the situation is not likely to improve. I had to manage my fear of needles when I went into healthcare but I don’t think my reaction was as challenging as yours. I’m worried for you a bit. And as a voice from the inside forced intervention is not anything that a healthcare worker wants to ever have to do. Extremely hard on people even if it is their job.,2024-03-26T17:16:21+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kwpgp45,Raspberry43,,"I would suggest bringing someone you trust with you. Before you go, explain to them the situation and how they can help. Ex: “I really need to go to the doctors to get ___ treatment. I am really scared and have a history of avoiding treatment even when I need it. I want to get the treatment, I just get scared. Can you help me by ___?” 
Then, when you get to the doctors, use a similar script. 

Things that I’ve said that have helped me in medical situations: 
- “I have a history of medical trauma. It’s important to me that during the procedure today you explain to me what you do before you do it.” 
- “I will probably start crying. You don’t need to stop. I’d rather you just keep going so I can get it over with as fast as possible.” 
- “I may need to take a break. If I raise my hand that means I need to stop and regroup before I can continue” 

The things that will help can be different for each person and even each situation. Try to brainstorm what you think could help! 

I’d also consider asking for a prescription medication. I have a prescription for hydroxyzine that is an anxiety med I can take up to three pills a day as needed. They really help me calm down and I will take them about 15-30 minutes before something stressful. You could ask your doctor for something like this. Obviously, it would have to be in advance so you could get the prescription. But something to think about! Good luck!",2024-03-26T21:44:00+00:00

Healthcare,post,1bo8hqt,MontyFishtown5142,Week Between Jobs,"Hi all,

I'll have a week between when insurance with my current employer ends and when I can jump on my new employers plan, and I'm just trying to figure out what's the best plan of action. I know this has been asked many times in this sub before because I've looked it up, but I just want to make sure I have it right.

Essentially, from what I've read, I have 60 days to sign up for COBRA from my old employer should anything happen in that week between when my insurance ends to when I can jump on my new employers plan. I could just purchase a month of coverage through the marketplace, but if I only want coverage for that week, I feel like that COBRA option is best, if I'm understanding how it works properly.

For what it's worth, it would just be my wife (48/F) and I (41/M) that need coverage and we don't take any medications or anything like that. We also don't have any major trips or anything extravagant coming up...other than an opening day baseball game the week between jobs starting up 😁.

If I'm off with how COBRA works, or if anyone has advice, I'd appreciate anything you all have to offer.

The question still exists on your tax returns (Do you have health insurance and if so, through what company, etc). But there is no fee, fine, or any penalty for not being covered. If you're otherwise healthy, I would honestly just go without and save yourself the headache and the money. 

Now I mean if something does come up to where you need to go to the doctor you're going to obviously have to go and take the $$ hit. But I bet that a trip to an urgent care clinic out of pocket would still be less expensive than a month of COBRA. And if you were to be in a car accident (God forbid), car insurance pays for that first before anyone else pays. But I think you'll be okay.",2024-03-27T23:19:35+00:00

Healthcare,post,1bkl7nx,AdonisGaming93,Should I even bother looking at healthcare if I'm gonna be working out of state? ,"Tldr:

I saved up enough to quit my job, work a seaonal job over the summer and then spend the rest of the year in Spain (my home country). Should I even bother getting helth insurance in new york (my current state i reside in) if I'm gonna be working seasonally over the summer at national parks, and then living in Spain the rest of the year when not working during the season?

Long story:

So I've been working toward BaristaFIRE, and have saved up enough now that I was able to quit my job in New York, and got a job working seasonally over the summer at a US national park.

Since I no longer have health insurance from my employer, i will need to get it from the market place (seasonal job often don't offer health insurance if it is less than 6 months of work). However... after the season ends, since im a dual citizen of Spain and USA, I plan to spend the time that I'm not working in Spain.

Looking at New York's healthcare website it seems like nothing will be covered while I'm working at national parks (out of network), and won't either while in Spain, (as a citizen once I'm in Spain I will have access to Spanish healthcare once my residency counts as after spending most of the year there and starting to oay taxes in Spain).

So... am I basically screwed if something happens to me while working at a National Park and destined for bankruptcy? ",2024-03-21T23:42:36+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kvz0kol,warfrogs,,"Yes - you absolutely should get covered through the marketplace.

While it won't cover normal services, such as MD office visits, it *will* cover emergent and catastrophic conditions. The NSA ensures INN cost-share amounts and coverage for emergency services regardless of provider network status.

If you get hit by a bus, have a tree fall on you, catch your leg with a chainsaw, etc. you want to be able to receive emergency care without staring down a $70,000 bill.

If you're going to be permanently stationed at a specific site, you could get coverage through that state instead if you establish residency. That would then allow you to get office visits and the like covered.

Get on a marketplace plan and then report that you're not going to be retaining residence in New York for 6 months or however long.",2024-03-22T00:09:40+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kvzqdak,mrsdspa,,"Normally, I am hesitant to say this, but you might look into a hospital indemnity or a short-term health plan. Both of these types of insurance can have (and do have) preexisting condition exclusions and are very much buyer beware as a result. You mentioned New York- check with a local agent in person (not online) who is licensed in New York and have them walk you through non-marketplace options. 

If the cost of ACA coverage wasn't so unachievable for most, I'd say get the marketplace coverage as a just in case/in the event of an emergency. But for most folks, paying the high premium doesn't make sense unless your medical costs are significant if you won't be in the country most of the year. 

Even if the insurer doesn't have official out of network benefits, emergency care is still covered up to stabilization. You are very correct that most insurers no longer offer out of network coverage, so outside of an emergency if you are out of network you are probably out of luck for good coverage. 

Good luck! And enjoy the summer gig - that was always a job I considered when I was single and didn't have a kiddo.",2024-03-22T02:58:34+00:00

I was having extreme stomach pain and because I haven't been able to get an appointment with a Primary Care Physican (all in my area either do not call back to schedule or they are several months out) I had to go to urgent care. The doctor at urgent care is the reason I hate going to doctors in the first place. He berated me about not having a primary care physican and that I cant use urgent care for these kind of situations. When I tried explaining the issues I was having scheduling he said I should've just taken the appointment and waited. He then pushed me off to emergency. Emergency was able to say that I have a probable ulcer and gave me enough medicine to coat my stomach for 3 days of use then told me to follow up with a primary care physican. Again I explained how difficult the situation is to get an appointment and they said there was nothing they could do. 

I started trying again and after 2 hours of phone calls to various offices that either dont take my insurance (despite being listed on my insurance website) or are 3 months til the next available appointment I finally have one for 2 weeks from now. 

So now I have to deal with the pain of an probable ulcer for 2 weeks longer with no prescribed medication to coat my stomach and reliant on over the counter pepcid to treat this. I also got the bill for the visit to emergency which totalled 7000 dollars ( I owe 1112).

Thanks so much guys",2024-03-20T23:36:29+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kvthcll,warfrogs,,"**For the hospital services**

What does your EOB from your insurer say? That's going to be the source of truth for your cost.

You can ignore any bills you receive from the providers that do not show an insurance adjustment, and the owed amount should be what your EOB shows under ""what you may owe""/""your owed amount""/""your payment due to provider"" something along those lines.

Unfortunately, ambulatory transportation as your hospital admission would be via ER is going to be required, so it wasn't something you could fight. If they were transporting you pre-stabilization, *or* they weren't of a level where they could provider appropriate care, but your condition was such that discharging you into a private vehicle could put your health, wellness, or the function or form of your body, mind, or facilities at risk, they could be held liable for inappropriately discharging you. This is a *protection* standard to prevent people who need additional services from being discharged and then not seeking the necessary care.

You'd be *stunned* how often someone says, ""actually, now that I've left the ER, I feel okay, I don't think I need more services"" (to spend more money) - all the while they need additional intervention within a relatively short time frame to save money. I've received calls from folks who are inpatient in high level ICUs because they're mad that the staff won't discharge them in the middle of an argument. Sometimes these complaints are reasonable, sometimes they're not, but they're all listened to - that doesn't mean that the person is qualified to determine if they need continued, ongoing services - and doesn't remove liability from the providers or care system.

**For the ambulance services**

There's a decent chance that the ambulance service, if not directly associated with the care system, will bill separately and will not submit to your insurer without it being a huge pain in the ass. This happens frequently. However, again - if you receive an EOB from your insurer, that's the source of truth and will show any amount owed.

**General**

If you're still in your deductible stage, that may be your owed amount - again, you need to see what your EOB says.

You can figure a lot of this out by looking at your plan documentation through your insurer's portal. Your cost-share amount, deductible, and max-out-of-pocket - as well as covered services and if cost-shares apply pre or post-deductible for a given service, and oftentimes bundling standards where multiple services are bundled into one cost-share amount - will all be in your plan document. Read the stuff *up to* the benefits breakdown - the meaty and important part is like 45-70 pages long, single sided, double spaced, sized 12 font. 

Then look at relevant benefits - you may want to contact the insurer to ask how a specific service was covered or not covered.

It really depends on what your insurer says via the EOB and your plan documents.",2024-03-21T00:25:33+00:00

Aetna can advise you of any amount you may owe and how to contact the providers; you can confirm it's an NSA covered encounter and that they need to contact your insurer's Provider Service Center to appeal the determination if they disagree with it. You may also have good luck through your benefits group depending on how skilled your HR is as they will have a dedicated contact at Aetna who can connect with the right people in network management if all of the involved providers (save the ambulance provider which is usually third-party, you may need to involve the AG for that one if you can't contact them) are in-network.",2024-03-21T01:13:17+00:00

Healthcare,comment,kvtpb03,warfrogs,,"Yeah - you need to contact Aetna to determine the reason for the denial and confirm no owed amount. I suspect that this is a NSA-covered encounter since it was pursuant to an emergency department encounter and the transportation and diagnostic imaging was determined to be directly related to ongoing stabilization services - if it's ordered that you need a specific service to rule out surgical interventions, that meets all the guidelines for medical necessity for both the transport and any subsequent admission and post-stabilization services under any policy I've ever seen, so it would likely have been bundled into the emergency department encounter.

Aetna can help with this - I'd recommend actually writing in via online form if that's an option - otherwise, to be honest, it's a crapshoot if it will get resolved on your first contact attempt with Aetna. If you do have to contact them twice, request an escalation or resolution team to address the issue. Written reps *tend* to be better than first-line phone reps, so you can get around some of those weaknesses - the biggest issue on that side is that it takes longer to get a response.

Healthcare,comment,ky6fhlm,DependentBonus768,,"agree, AI has the potential to be a game-changer in healthcare. Here's why:

* **Improved diagnoses and treatments:** AI can analyze massive amounts of data, including medical scans, to identify patterns and potential issues that doctors might miss. This can lead to earlier and more accurate diagnoses.
* **Personalized medicine:** AI can analyze a patient's unique medical history and genetics to create personalized treatment plans.
* **Reduced errors and improved efficiency:** AI can automate tasks like scheduling and paperwork, freeing up healthcare professionals to focus on patients. It can also help prevent errors by double-checking prescriptions and identifying potential risks.

However, there are challenges:

* **Data privacy:** Ensuring patient data is secure and used ethically is crucial.
* **Algorithmic bias:** AI algorithms can perpetuate biases present in the data they are trained on. Careful development and monitoring are needed to mitigate this.
* **Human oversight:** AI should be a tool to assist healthcare professionals, not replace them. Human expertise and judgment remain essential for quality care.

Overall, AI offers exciting possibilities for improving healthcare. By addressing the challenges, we can harness its power to create a healthier future for everyone.

And because of that I am so VERY glad we don't use EPIC where I work.

I think the only reason why this stuff grates on my nerves so much is that before I got my MBA, I was a psychologist. So I actually pay attention to how people seem to be processing things and to the meaning behind what they think they're saying.

So sadly, here's about as far as the thought process goes when this stuff gets greenlit. The CEO, or VP asks the 2 following questions.

1. Oh, can we use this new thing that's trendy in tech circles to help sell our product or make us money?
2. Can we get away with it?

Usually, at no point in this process is the question ""What are the potential risks of this"" asked or taken seriously.

And 3 years ago these companies were eagerly trying to find ways to incorporate Block-Chain into their EMR systems because cryptocurrency was huge back then.

* Do LLMs have a use? Yes and they're amazing at that stuff and are going to be huge.
* Is that use handling vital information where the LLMs' tendency to ""hallucinate"" and make shit up could get someone killed? Oh god no.
* Isn't this the same as a program using a complex algorithm to assist in say, juggling financial data? No, different style of algorithm. Or to put it another way, a helper monkey and a service dog can both assist people with disabilities, but they're not the same. One's a dog and the other's a monkey.",2024-03-20T14:41:47+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kvqhxub,thenightgaunt,,"Yes. 

The point of a large language model chatbot (which is what folks are calling AI right now because it sounds ""cool"") is a constantly ""learning"" algorithm and database of information. They're very complex models of interconnections between words, sentences, and other reference data and predict based on incoming data what the most likely reply is going to be on a letter by letter and word by word basis. 

The arguments go back and forth depending on the tech being used and how one defines ""memory"" and ""learning"". LLMs are supposed to be stateless, meaning that each incoming question from a user is processed independently of other users' interactions. That it doesn't learn or ""remember"" once it's put into production and your just running off the same unchanged algorithm. BUT, there are ways LLMs do ""remember"" and can be tuned based on that new data to help shape them further and reduce ""hallucinations"". And their goal is to better develop these dynamic tuning processes that will allow the LLMs to train themselves on the go, so to speak.

So yeah, my concern is that if a LLM is being used in healthcare to deal with protected patient data, that the LLM will in some manner store that data (ie remember it) and then repeat it at a later time. And THAT is a HIPAA violation waiting to happen. Especially if we're talking about a massive LLM that say google is running and then having be used for multiple clients including the healthcare industry. 

To put it in other words. A provider enters a Patient's information, let's say Mr. Smith who was born in 1980 and who's SSN is 999999999, into their ""AI Helper"" app, and a month later and 1000 miles away, some game designer uses the same LLM service by google that the doc's ""AI Helper"" uses, to create a character for their video game and the LLM creates a character named Mr. Smith who was born in 1980 and who's SSN is 999999999.

While there are ethical concerns that have been raised about those, the general decision is that as long as some basic privacy concerns can be guaranteed, the net benefit to society makes it worth it.

The data I'm talking about here is PHI that's not been de-identified. In another reply I gave an example, all hypothetical but not unrealistic given how the folks behind these LLMs are trying to get these things to dynamically tune themselves in real-time. Let's say google uses it's LLM service and offers hospitals and EMR vendors it's use to handle registration, billing, etc. So a facility uses the tool to register Mr. Smith, who was born in 1980 and who's SSN is 999-99-9999. The LLM now training itself with each prompt, stores that interaction. 1 month later a game designer in another state uses the LLM enabled game development tools that google offers, to create a character for their game. And that tool spits out ""Mr. Smith, born in 1980, SSN 999-99-9999"". 

Now that's a bit of a silly example to be true. But it does reflect a key concern about these LLMs. And right now, the main assurance we have that nothing like this will ever happen is tech-bros behind these companies saying ""Trust me bro"". I'd rather there be actual regulations written down, protecting us.

The doctor that she is seeing, her primary care doctor, the name of the doctor's office/practice, or the hospital system that the practice is affiliated with?

November and take the chance of something happening.  My sister was also diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon Cancer and that worries me. Along with that I am sure I have other health issues that need to be addressed. 

What would you say I do? I want to get looked at but at the same time I do not want to be left with a massive health care bill.  I really do not know what to do.  I really want to go get looked at but I have no insurance and I cannot afford a outrages hospital bill. Can someone please give me some advice?

I would check out these options in this article. They provide links to resources that may be beneficial to you. 
I really feel you on this! I would highly recommend applying for Medicaid if you qualify! I am a person with a physical disability, I use a power chair and I’ve recently had a lot of appointments because I need a neck surgery. My employer’s insurance kinda sucks sometimes and doesn’t cover everything, so thankfully I have Medicaid to pick up what they won’t pay for. I’ve also taken advantage of the sliding scale offers at times because I’ve been seeing specialists out of my network. 

When you say that living longer is worth the debt, I wholeheartedly agree! I dropped $5000 out of pocket to set up appointments with the Mayo Clinic because the circumstances that I’m dealing with right now terrify me more than losing some money.

Big cities have the demand and therefore the funding for good hospitals. But those hospitals are always in high demand. They're overrun, they're busy. If you pick a city that has a really good hospital system and then look for suburbs near it that 1) have funding and 2) have hospitals/clinics that are within the same hospital network, those would be your best bet. It's a delicate balance. You don't want an area that's too small because then they won't have very many specialties/doctors/resources, but you don't want the biggest hospital in the middle of a big city. Rich suburbs seem to be the best. However, like other commenters have pointed out, we're in a national healthcare staffing crisis. Hospitals and clinics have been swamped since the pandemic and they never really recovered. So even when you find your ideal hospital/clinic, be patient with them. ER and urgent care wait times will be long everywhere. The staff everywhere are short staffed. Everyone is putting out fires everywhere every day.

I’ve been dealing with various hospitals and medical systems for about 10 years now. I am currently having trouble with the office my neurologist switched to. Below is a list: 

-They ghost me for weeks on end
- ignore voicemails
- don’t follow through on transfers
- don’t have records ready when I show up for my appointments (they’re 2 hours away, it takes up a full day of travel)
- the receptionists will leave me on hold for 30-60min intervals before hanging up
- the receptionists will tell me different info than my doctor (told me that my X Ray was “normal,” when 3 weeks prior my neuro told me how serious of a problem I had)

I’m a very understanding person and a seasoned patient. I’m always respectful, show up for my appointments, and do my due diligence. I pay on time, have physical copies of all my records, and really just need help. I’m wondering what the most proper way is to go about expressing my concern with their company? For reference, I live in Michigan. Is there a medical licensing board/ ethics board I would be able to write something to? 

I want to go about this as constructively as possible. Once I get one last referral, I’m removing myself from my neuro’s care which isn’t my first choice. I like him a lot, but the stress of working with this office is too much. Would appreciate any advice! ",2024-03-19T02:29:47+00:00

Healthcare,comment,kvbwll9,konqueror321,,"This is a big question, so big that books have been written about it. One of the best, most insightful books I've read in the past 10 years on the subject of the high price of American medicine, and how this came to be, is ""An American Sickness"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. See [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6139860/) for a book review. Your local library probably has a copy, or Amazon. 

The simple answer is that every entity engaged in the provision of health care in the US has worked tirelessly over the past hundred years to have laws constructed at the state and federal level that limit competition and do not limit fees or prices, and learning how to structure fees so as to maximize income. The end result is our dysfunctional, patchwork system, that costs 17% of the GNP and delivers mediocre outcomes (lifespan and infant mortality). 

In a free market, competition would result in a 'fair' price for goods and services, at least this is what economists tell us. But 'health care' in the US is about as far from a 'free market' as one could imagine - every transaction is somehow affected by government regulations, that mysteriously limit competition but do not limit prices.

They do TRY to justify it (""We spend more money on R&D! We have the greatest breakthroughs! Let the people decide!"") It's all lies and BS. 

Some of the things lobbyists focus on related to healthcare:

1. They fight regulation of all kinds. For example, in other countries, prices of some things, like critical medications, are controlled. We don't do that here. So, a company like Mylan, who at that time made EpiPen, a drug that prevents people from dying from anaphylactic shock, did no new development on their drug, had no major increases in raw materials, and yet raised prices on this lifesaving drug by 600% between 2007 and 2016. Why? Because lobbyists prevent any type of price control and because shareholders are always screaming for more money NOW. Other companies take an existing formula and tweak it slightly so they can extend patent life and prevent a generic from becoming popular.
2. They eschew standardization. The issue of electronic health records could have been figured out more than a decade ago if they government had demanded the development of standards. 
3. They prevent Medicare and Medicaid from being able to negotiate some prices with suppliers. Since commercial payers eventually align with what Medicare and Medicaid due (example: ""quality care"" payments), negotiation ability would eventually impact all of us.
4. They fight efforts toward single-payer care which is the only way prices are ever going to come down.
5. They fought for the FDA to prevent the importation of lower-cost drugs from other countries, like Canada, where the drugs cost less.

As I said, lobbyists aren't the reason we have high-cost, low-quality healthcare in the US. They are just a symptom of a for-profit health system.

Healthcare,comment,kv3rliu,warfrogs,,">My provider submitted documents of trial and error of all other covered tiered drugs and my photos of allergic reactions to those drugs because again, the sulfite allergy.

**Hard** doubt.

The number of times I've been told ""my physician sent this over!"" while I'm looking at a packet that has NONE of the notes they're referencing is INCREDIBLY high.

It's *far* more likely your provider didn't actually do a P2P and had staff send documentation - documentation which was almost assuredly incomplete.

Again, 10% of all denials for claims and prior authorizations are audited - if you believe that the clinical decisions, which are made by a physician, are being done fast and loose, you're fully off base. The penalties, including monetary and contractual, are *very* significant.

[Here's a story from a completely unrelated person stating the same thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthcare/comments/1aliroh/have_you_ever_done_anything_desperate_to_meet/kpg3ibb/) - the provider didn't send the full medical records they said they did in spite of swearing up and down that they did so - resulting in the member not receiving the care they needed because contraindications weren't sent to the insurer. This is why 40% of Prior Authorization denials are WITHDRAWN *not* overturned when it reaches the IRE stage - it's oftentimes the first time that the provider themselves sees what the insurer is *actually* receiving as they rely on their staff to do what they say; unfortunately, that oftentimes does not actually occur. Since the physician will generally have the full file, once the insurer rep is able to see that there are contraindications or that other interventions required for Step Therapy have occurred, their requirements are met.

Over 80% of denials are fully avoidable by providers actually doing what **CMS** dictates - somehow the regulations being written in blood (or healthcare costs) for providers are just *toooo* onerous. Somehow, insurers are able to keep up though. Seems like an endemic problem with providers, but nah - blame insurers - doesn't matter if they're actually to blame, thus leading to CMS focusing their Prior Authorization initiatives on their failures rather than insurer malfeasance - it's just so much easier to blame insurance because, after all, the provider *totally* told you the truth and there's *no* chance that they weren't truthful about something that would make them look bad.

>mind you insurance was covering this for me for four years and I received no notice that they would not be covering this year.

Yeah! They're very self-serving - especially in risk management, which is why they don't do dumb shit stuff like improperly denying Prior Authorizations which are heavily audited.

But hey - since this is **such** a huge issue, I'm sure CMS is staring down insurers on the topic, right?

Hilarious indeed that you believe that physicians and medical staff have the expertise and knowledge required to speak to these issues - especially when the AMA itself gets it wrong.

Of course providers want less work to do with Prior Authorization - it's a shame that they've historically been known to bilk taxpayers and patients thus requiring the process to prevent further Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.

Healthcare,post,1bele6a,Jeffbak,The effect of the massively growing growing gig economy on healthcare.,"Relatively new to looking at healthcare - I had always been part of the camp that just knew it was a “mess” but didn’t know where the problems lay.

Has anybody really studied the effect of the gig economy on our healthcare system?

Are Uber and Lyft required to verify 1099’s? If not, there could be enormous additional Medicaid/Medicare stress financially placed on the govt. (and hospitals) from underreporting on one’s income and therefore qualifying when they wouldn’t normally. I assume this data would be easy for these “apps” to provide to the government.

The gig economy has gotten too large to continue to allow this many people to go uninsured. This likely strains Medicaid as well as hospitals. Hospitals get the double whammy from an increase in completely uninsured, and then the increase in # on Medicaid due to potential under reporting on income from gig workers. This is assuming they get zero from uninsured and a smaller percent from Medicaid than they would get from a private insurer if the patient’s income bracket priced them out of receiving Medicaid. 

For those who work in healthcare, do you think the massively growing gig economy is adding strain to hospital finances? Having lived in CA I witnessed how much Uber and Lyft essentially spent to have these employment laws (independent contractor status) go in their favor. I also used to chat with my Uber drivers, and they would take the “flexibility” and “freedom” of driving with Uber, over things like healthcare. So it was definitely a winnable battle for these gig companies. One could argue that it is then better for the companies and employees. But my bigger question is whether it’s sustainable?",2024-03-14T13:39:11+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kuu2zjt,HIPAA_University,,"Medicare is based on age and Medicaid income so not sure how these tie into the gig economy. 

The way it works for all 1099s is they have open enrollment on the marketplace to sign up for gov sponsored health plans and those plans are priced (read: discounted) based off your income. So if you are just over the threshold to qualify for Medicaid, you will get a discounted premium. 

Now, the issue I could see is that some of these people decide to go uninsured, which keeps them from getting preventative care, which leads to more complex health issues as they start to move towards the age of 65, which is when you qualify for Medicare and become the govs responsibility to treat (in the simplest of terms). The more unhealthy 65yo you have, the more $ the gov is gonna spend on treatment. 

I think you should read up on Medicaid more, because the way your post reads is that you are under the impression that “if you don’t have insurance you qualify for Medicaid” and that isn’t the case. It is income based and there are a lot of variances between states — from how people qualify, apply, how much $ the state gets from the US Gov (look up FMAP). 

While there are a lot of issues in our system, including coverage gaps (childless adults is a major one), I don’t think people being on 1099s is a big issue. Those folks all have access to coverage, and I believe only about 10-12% of the US is “uninsured” so those people (for the most part) are getting some sort of coverage.",2024-03-14T13:58:13+00:00

Healthcare,post,1be37m3,Gaxil_,US healthcare (social policy) - How does it work exactly?,"Hello there,

&#x200B;

I would like to know more about US healthcare and social policy concerning it.

I know that there is insurance of different levels and each provider has some doctors that accept that provider. If its not accepted you will have to pay all of it, if it does then there is often copay.  
When it comes to prescription drugs insurance may pay part of it but I am not exacly sure on how bug of a part they pay and how exactly it works. Also its usually expensive (stuff like insulin).

**I want to know as much as I can, like:**

Federal vs state?

How big are the differences between each state (heard from one acquaintance that Texas has better medicare/medicaid than their state)?

How much is the insurance provided by work (if you get fired does it end imiidiately) and how it different from consumer one, are they more local like for state only or do they work in all of US?

What about dentist (are they usually included, do they cost lot more?)?

How exacly does stuff like medicare, medicaid, ACA work?

What if you are unconcious and you get treated at hospital that doesnt accept your insurance?

Does ambulance ask you where you wanna so you are insured there and is the ambulance itself covered too or at least in some cases (I remember article about person yelling not to call one)?

What about children, do they have some federal level insurance or do they have to rely on their parents for one?

Healthcare,post,1bdw1om,andra-moi-ennepe,Why are Quest Diagnostics locations such post-apocalyptic hellscapes?,"NB: I just moved to a new state, and my previous doctor of 12 years had in-house phlebotomy. I do not recall this being so terrible 12 years ago, but also I was in another state.

In my new state, the first time I needed bloodwork, my doc said ""just go to any Quest location."" Okay, I try calling one to find out things like hours or whether I needed an appointment, and after 45 minutes on hold, I decided just to go down there and see if I could get bloodwork. 

After wandering the halls of a smallish hospital (did their map say they were IN the hospital? No.) for a while, I finally find the small, hardly marked door for the Quest lab. I walk in. There is one person sitting in a chair, and a significantly older lady (I'd say past 85 y/o) wrestling with a tablet-screen-thing. No employees at all. No signage to indicate what I should do. So I wait. Eventually I realize that the lady is having real problems with the screen. I go over and offer help. Then I offer help again, as I realize she is a monolingual Spanish speaker. I'm bilingual, so I kinda think of it as an occasional civic duty to help those who are not. So, we're looking at the screen together, and THIS is when I realize that the screen is there in lieu of a human, and this is how you're supposed to ""check in."" Well, my little old lady friend has no more idea what's going on than I do and has been, as far as I can tell, hitting buttons at semi-random. She had gotten the screen localized into Spanish, which, yay, win for little old lady, but based on a long history of teaching English and writing, I'm gonna say with some confidence that it wasn't her language but her literacy that was preventing her from checking in. So, I ask her all the questions orally, and fill in her answers on the screen. When she's checked in and settled, I leave, never having seen a single sign of life. I hope little old lady got her bloodwork! Note that this location is in a small US city with a HUGE low-income immigrant population. Lack of English and low literacy are two ENTIRELY predictable situations.

I go to another one in the slightly more affluent town next door. Same. No humans. One screen. I go to another one in a medium income town. Same. No humans. Just screen. No instructions on the wall. No ""ring here to talk to someone."" 

Finally, I have found the last refuge (or greatest crime) of having high literacy, access to a car, and research skills, and find a primary care physician who DOES employ in house phlebotomy. A year of calm, cheerful, and uneventful lab tests follow. Today I went to get blood drawn and the phlebotomist was out sick, so the office suggested another Quest location. Now we're in a FOURTH city. Same post-apocalyptic hellscape?!?@#(@\*$&!! 

How did this come about? Why is it allowed to continue? Is there an agency or someone to report to? It's like self-checkout in the supermarket, but 1) it's not optional (one can still generally find a checkout person in the grocery) and 2) it's about health and wellbeing, not whether your can of beans scanned right and 3) MOST people are not scared of grocery stores whereas a LOT of people are scared of needles, doctors, tests, etc. A non-anxious presence to get you through the system would be GOOD for healthcare!

Such experiences from the patient and employee perspective within the company made me quit after 2.5 years working there.

Despite being a multimillion company, the turnover rate there is high due to its stingy and stressful environment. The check in tablet up front serves as the company's ""cost-effective"" substitute for front desk personnel. The company always lean out their workers (on average 1-4 employees per site) that each employee usually sees about 35-45 patients per day. So in my location, only two workers worked there and on average 70-80 patients or more before/after holidays would come in often without being greeted because we are already occupied with another patient to file paperwork/draw blood/process specimens/conduct drug screens (in select locations) at our draw rooms (4 major roles in 1 underpaid job). The check in tablets, supposedly to provide efficiency, always backfires on us due to constant troubleshooting and most of regular clients being tech-illiterate and/or non-English speakers. The busiest sites (100+ patients), the customer service deteriorates as the workload cuts the staff's ability to be thorough enough to address the unique concerns of each patient, while trying to meet the regional daily metrics and expectations in order to maintain that measly 2% hourly pay raise per year. 

The executive members under the CEO, who approved the system in the first place, have a lot of business experience, but little to no experience in the realm of healthcare that they are often tone deaf to what it is like working on the floor or cared more about profit margins. Their direction and protocols implemented I have seen during my time there added more busy work and difficulty, which worsened the patient experience as our company refuses to prepare their clients and patients of new policies ahead of time before it is actually implemented. Company even refuses to post drug screening hours and appointment/walk-in policies at eligible location and online. They are more worried that this info would impact their profit margins and would rather have the employees on their floor deal with our clients'/patients' upset behavior, than preventing distressing experiences to begin with.

If you see enough reviews from Yelp from any other Quest location, you would see that most of the complaints have to do with the company policies influence their poor patient experience (i.e. patients unable to get an appointment last minute/ having to wait a long time due to staffing issues).  I have brought up these concerns to my supervisor before, but nothing has changed and no one cares enough to fix such issues mentioned. In turn, my co-workers have called out sick more than usual that we were often understaffed and burned out. My time working there ruined my mental sanity until I finally left for my current job that no longer deals with patients and petty management.",2024-03-13T18:05:40+00:00

This being said, due to these factors of not possibly having a clear healthcare plan (perhaps I need to go over it on the phone with dad), being in a city far away from home and no support group, playing in a college town yet not being a current student so unable to use their healthcare facilities, is this a bad decision healthcare wise?",2024-03-12T21:04:45+00:00

Reason being, is they are not going to be a consistent patient, and will schedule things ad-hoc every 4-6mo (think for Adderrall you have to have a consultation every 4, maybe, 6mo. One of the 2) and trying to chase them down becomes difficult. 

Mental health care in the US is completely broken, but not for the reasons people think. There is a provider shortage, but also providers have 0 incentive to treat “difficult” patients. It’s not like traditional medicine where more complex cases get significantly higher reimbursement and/or fees, so there’s an incentive to take on those cases. 

In mental healthcare, you don’t get much higher reimbursement or fees for treating a drug addicted schizophrenic, who is convinced god is talking to him through the radio. So why take them as patients? Wouldn’t you much rather have some HS or middle school kid, who has parents schedule their appointments, has insurance, and will make 95% of their appointments on time, just for them to  talk about how they’re anxious about starting HS? 

It’s an easy choice as a provider who you’ll want to take as a patient, and a HUGE reason why there are so many absolute maniacs out there… 20yrs+ ago those were the people who got the treatment and were able to “get them off the street” and get them the acute care they need. 

Now, the “mental healthcare system” is filled with teens/tweens who have “anxiety” or “depression” and they are absolute cash cows and incredibly easy to treat. The schizophrenic, addict?

Healthcare,post,1bcdgiq,HammerToTheBalls,I just found out I still have Medicaid and I definitely don’t qualify?,"So I’m in Kentucky and in 2022 I was laid off and applied/was approved for Medicaid. I got a job later in the same year that would have me making too much to qualify anymore and figured it would just drop off after the end of the year. I have not even looked at the Kynect (Medicaid) site since then. 

I got married in 2023 and our combined income means I definitely am not even close to qualifying plus I had my own insurance at the time and opted not to join my husband’s. Now I just started a new job that has incredibly high monthly health insurance payments, like as much as if my employer didn’t sponsor insurance. After googling I saw there was a relief type program through the Kynect site I could apply for help with the monthly insurance payments. I log in and Medicaid has been autorenewing for me since 2022! The only messages to me were the 1095 document and a statement saying it had been renewed.

I have no idea how I have been renewed when I haven’t submitted any documentation since I applied in 2022 and I am SO confused as to how I still have Medicaid. Am I unintentionally doing something wrong/illegal?

Healthcare,post,1bbll2n,Jeffbak,Trying to understand why Medicaid/Medicare is such a debacle (I don’t work in healthcare),"Based on the conversations I have had with friends/family in healthcare, it sounds like our own government uses Medicaid reimbursements as a “bargaining chip” to try and keep healthcare costs down. Although admittedly I have limited knowledge about the entire “broken” healthcare system, it seems as though when the government uses our most vulnerable patients as bargaining chips/pawns to keep healthcare costs down, all they are really doing is bankrupting low income community hospitals thereby leading to consolidation (which apparently they’re trying to avoid but are actually causing?), as well as limiting access for these disenfranchised patients whose low income hospitals close if they cannot be bought after they go bankrupt because the govt isn’t footing the bill. Bankrupting low income community hospitals also leads to consolidation and higher prices.

For those in healthcare - if you had to boil it down to a couple primary “broken” parts of healthcare, do you think this is one of the biggest problems?

If so, why the hell can’t the govt just foot the bill so we can keep these low income hospitals opened and the tens of thousands of nurses/doctors/admins/staff employed? With all of the spending we currently do, I’m sure we can bump that 55-65% Medicaid reimbursement up to at least 90%? As a taxpayer I would happily pay for this if it meant healthcare for all ran much, much smoother.

However, the govt. not footing the bill for our most vulnerable patients is like the govt not paying rent for the office buildings they lease. Coming from the commercial real estate industry myself, we love leasing to the govt because they have the strongest credit. Why then do they dick around with paying for our most vulnerable citizens?",2024-03-10T21:25:54+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kua9iak,DerFisher,,"You're thinking about it in the wrong direction. Medicaid / Medicare doesn't reimburse at 55%-65%; commercial insurance reimburses at 1.x times Medicaid / Medicare. Between those 2 and TriCare, the U.S. taxpayer spend 1.8-2 trillion dollars a year for healthcare. That is a per-capita spending level similar to the 2nd most expensive country for healthcare - the U.K. Except we don't have free healthcare, which is bonkers when you think about how government spending is less than half of what this country pays for healthcare.

In my mind, these are a few of the big reasons that contribute. I could write a small essay on any one of these points. I'm going to summarize even though it'll make room for others to pick them apart:

1. Geography - America is very large and requires more facilities and staff which serve less dense populations
2. Administrative costs - Hospitals, like colleges, are extremely top-heavy with middle and upper level management. These are mostly needed to help navigate the complex industry.
3. Demographics - baby boomers are not only taking themselves out of the workforce (as physicians and nurses) but simultaneously needing more care in their old age. 
4. Overstaffed physician offices - the complexity of our healthcare system requires more personnel; compared to European countries, to handle the dozens of tasks that don't exist in other health care systems. On average, each physician in the U.S. in private practice requires 14-20 non-clinical staff.
5. Overpaid physicians - Might get some people upset here, but it's true. The average U.S. physician makes 3x their European counterpart (primary care excluded). In their defense, most physicians today graduate with +$200k in student loans. 
6. Subsidized Pharmaceutical research - Big Pharma is eager to develop new medicines in part because of the temporary monopoly we create for them in the U.S. via patents. But you can find those same medicines made by the same companies for far cheaper in other developed countries, even after patents expire. Pharma is okay with selling medicines outside of the U.S. with more reasonable margins because they know they can recoup development costs in the U.S. and then some.
7. Health Insurance - there's so much I could say here... In any company the line must always go up. They pay very smart and very influential people to make sure the line always goes up. Increasing prices, shady pre-authorization practices, all in service of the almighty line.
8. States - The U.S. is 50 countries wearing one trenchcoat. Rules vary from state to state. As an example, a trained and qualified physician must get licensed in any state they want to practice in. This is not a simple process. Hospitals cannot rely on national knowledge to navigate the industry as a best practice in New York for dealing with Blue Cross Blue Shield of NY likely won't apply to a Hospital in Georgia working with Blue Cross Blue Shield of GA.
9. Proliferation of Middle men - Group purchasing organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, even down to nurse call solutions; there are so many departments /groups / resellers which add little value except their network and yet add cost. I worked at a company selling a \[thing\] to hospitals, except we had a partner relationship with a few companies selling a separate thing to hospitals basically to help us get in the door. The stipend was that this other company would resell our \[thing\]. Without adding any value, not even delivery. They resold a $40 thing for $199.

Healthcare,comment,kuarsyp,kg4214,,"Medicaid is actually the best insurance coverage in terms of out of pocket costs and covered services. However, there are so many providers who are reluctant to take medicaid patients because 1) they tend to have more complex conditions and 2) higher no show rate and no insurance coverage reimbursed doctors for visits their patients don’t show up for. Historically, Medicaid reimbursement rates for services have been lower than private insurance but there are states who are raising these rates to be comparable to private insurance (more of an incentive for providers to see medicaid patients and higher reimbursement for institutions like community hospitals that see a lot of individuals). Medicaid is really tough because it’s coverage and rates are set on a state by state basis, the federal government doesn’t have a say in how states run their medicaid programs they are just required to have one. It gets extremely political especially with funding and arguing for increased taxation because red states, for example, are unlikely to increase taxes to pay for public healthcare programs. The federal government also has a matching rate which you mentioned above which varies based on how “wealthy” the individuals in the state are. That being said, the federal government won’t just increase what they reimburse because CMS doesn’t really have much involvement in state Medicaid programs. They act more as a regulatory/funding agency if anything. I agree it’s really sad there are so many community healthcare centers suffering because they see majority low income patients, but it’s definitely tough country wide because Medicaid is decentralized and some states care more about their Medicaid populations/health centers than others.",2024-03-11T00:23:37+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kuax6lb,kcl97,,">our own government uses Medicaid reimbursements as a “bargaining chip” to try and keep healthcare costs down

What exactly is meant by this statement?  If you think about it, at most Medicaid can do is to negotiate, not force, a discounted price for poor patients and that is pretty much its mission.  It is not likely to have any say on how the whole industry charges patients.   Keep in mind that we have a shortage of doctors and nurses and hospitals, this is a case of demand outstripping the supply.   At the same time, the healthcare industry has overwhelming lobbying power to increase the price of everything, like needles, cotton balls, q-tips, etc.  The government is run by the rich for the rich.  

The reason why poor community clinics are closing is simply just they do not have enough good paying healthy patients.  Ideally you want to run a business where all your patients are trivial cases that do not cost much to take care of and uses healthcare dollars needlessly   Believe it or not, the ideal patient from a hospitals perspective is a Medicare senior with some sort of chronic pain, who comes in regularly for a bunch non-invasive machine run procedures and eats tons of meds, especially stuff like cholesterol reducing meds, which costs tons but cheap to make.  Medicare unlike Medicaid actually pays well so pretty much every hospital accepts it.  

The worst case for a clinic would be to have a few Medicaid patients and that is it.  This is the case with most rural clinics since these areas typically do not have good paying jobs and are sparsely populated.  And worst still is that costs of medical supply as well as trained personnel are increasing, so market force is forcing these clinics to close   

If you really care about saving rural and poor community clinics.  The best option is to set up public clinics and public health insurance better than Medicaid, like Medicare for all.

e:  also, econ 101 says that business will refuse to provide service unless the payment outstrips the cost, this means even with the Medicaid dollar, a clinic is at least breaking even or at least getting some other benefit in return.  no one is forcing anyone to do anything.",2024-03-11T00:59:18+00:00

Healthcare,comment,kudm8mu,Wiser_Owl99,,"I have experience with Medicaid across the country. Every state is unique.  Medicaid covers a lot of things that regular health insurance doesn't cover, like transportation to appointments, etc.  States add extras all the time.  Our Medicaid programs cover a ton of things that are not covered by public health programs in Europe and Canada.

The Medicaid population also tends to use healthcare more often because they are sicker or they are children.  The Medicaid population also has a high no-show rate and many late arrivals for appointments and procedures, which add administrative costs.  Dentists in my area have said that 75%  of Medicaid clients don't show up for appointments.  The impact is huge when you are working with children because Mrs. Smith had 5 kids scheduled.  

Payor mix is very important for the vibrancy of a hospital.  I believe the usual mix is 65% private pay/private insurance  20% Medicare  15% Medicaid.  Medicaid rares are usually 20% less than Medicare rates(assuming Medicaid is solvent)

The cost of personnel, equipment, and supplies is rising every skyrocketing.  Hospitals in low income areas recruit overseas for physicians and nurses to try to offset these costs. Of course. this leads to high turnover because these employees leave for better pay when their contracts are up.

In most cases the govt will pay for Medicare / medicaid care totally. It's only that the hospital makes 55-65% on a Medicare medicaid patient as they do a commercial patient. There is an increasing amount of things govt programs won't pay for or partially pay for - I believe it's mostly due to an effort to control spend. This is likely to continue to get worse unless core issues are addressed.

Rural hospitals will continue to close and merge with for profit mega systems because they lack the ability to negotiate with Insurance providers, middle men, and care providers they wish to recruit. Best case scenario they're acquired by a regional mission focuses non-profit.

As a side note, this creates a whole separate problem big enough for me to list.

Healthcare,post,1bbccfr,Jeffbak,Some thoughts on Medicaid ,"I understand there has been a cyber hack that hasn’t enabled hospitals, pharmacies, private practices, etc. to bill a dollar for Medicaid patients over the past two weeks. Remember this is also coming at a time when the govt. is also only reimbursing 55 - 65% of Medicaid in many cases. As a long-time taxpayer, I completely understand the need for Medicaid, and I have no problem paying for it via taxes. Those who cannot afford health insurance should have adequate access. This seems to be a fairly bipartisan view.

However, how can our government expect hospitals to survive if Uncle Sam only wants to pay 55-65% of the cost to treat these underprivileged patients? Even more shockingly, how can the government just expect hospitals, pharmacies, private practices, etc. to front 100% of Medicaid for at least a 2 week period when the government’s own website gets hacked? 

This is ineptitude at its finest. We constantly hear from politicians about how the “healthcare system is broken.” However, I think we know where it is broken…which starts with the government. When they can’t manage a simple website and it goes down for weeks, how can they expect these hospitals and healthcare providers to foot the entire bill? When Medicaid patients are billed, how can they expect to only pay 55%? Yes, the system is certainly broken, but it’s broken because our own government’s practices have broken it.

I understand they try to use Medicaid reimbursements as a bargaining chip, but all that really is doing is using our most vulnerable patients as pawns and collateral to avoid footing the bill - which they may not be able to even afford. When they use these poor patients as pawns, and decide not to foot the bill, low income community hospitals end up going bankrupt, thereby leading to more of the consolidation our government is apparently trying “so hard to avoid.” 

As a taxpayer who does not work in the healthcare system, I think it is disgusting that our government uses these poor Medicaid patients as pawns to leverage their own interest (aka not paying bills). They say this is to drive healthcare costs down, but all it does is lead to more BK’s which in turn leads to more consolidation and higher prices for all.

This is especially true if it was paxil because, while common, it is not generally the go to med for younger doctors to prescribe.

In terms of ""sharing"" meds, I'll advise against it and leave it at that, we dont worry about people handing out antidepressants or most meds tbh.. as long as it is not a controlled substance like xanax/Adderall/oxy/etc.... for those we have to be more careful because they are so addictive. SSRIs like paxil are not addictive and not controlled.

My younger brother was very active and super fit when he suddenly discovered he had stage 4 bowel cancer and a large tumour after a bowel bleed. He had a low paid job, young wife and two kids in school, and our universal healthcare not only covered 100% of the costs of radiotherapy, several major surgeries to install a stoma, remove a section of bowel and a section of liver, chemotherapy, PET scanning with one of the newest scanners available in the world, then eventually reconnecting everything, but did it so well that he is still with us in good health 6 years later and his kids are in high school.

The UK recently did a study and they found that from the three biggest healthcare risks; [obesity](https://iea.org.uk/themencode-pdf-viewer-sc/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Obesity-and-the-Public-Purse-PDF.pdf&settings=111111011&lang=en-GB#page=&zoom=75&pagemode=), [smoking](https://iea.org.uk/themencode-pdf-viewer-sc/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Smoking-and-the-Public-Purse.pdf&settings=111111011&lang=en-GB#page=&zoom=75&pagemode=
), and [alcohol](https://iea.org.uk/themencode-pdf-viewer-sc/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DP_Alcohol%20and%20the%20public%20purse_63_amended2_web.pdf&settings=111111011&lang=en-GB#page=&zoom=75&pagemode=), they realize a net **savings** of £22.8 billion (£342/$474 per person) per year. This is due primarily to people with health risks not living as long (healthcare for the elderly is exceptionally expensive), as well as reduced spending on pensions, income from sin taxes, etc.. 

In the US there are 106.4 million people that are overweight, at an additional lifetime healthcare cost of $3,770 per person average. 98.2 million obese at an average additional lifetime cost of $17,795. 25.2 million morbidly obese, at an average additional lifetime cost of $22,619. With average lifetime healthcare costs of $879,125, obesity accounts for 0.99% of our total healthcare costs. 

https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1038/oby.2008.290

We're spending 165% more than the OECD average on healthcare--that works out to over half a million dollars per person more over a lifetime of care--and you're worried about 0.99%?

Here's another study, that actually found that lifetime healthcare for the obese are *lower* than for the healthy. 

>Although effective obesity prevention leads to a decrease in costs of obesity-related diseases, this decrease is offset by cost increases due to diseases unrelated to obesity in life-years gained. Obesity prevention may be an important and cost-effective way of improving public health, but it is not a cure for increasing health expenditures...In this study we have shown that, although obese people induce high medical costs during their lives, their lifetime health-care costs are lower than those of healthy-living people but higher than those of smokers. Obesity increases the risk of diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart disease, thereby increasing health-care utilization but decreasing life expectancy. Successful prevention of obesity, in turn, increases life expectancy. Unfortunately, these life-years gained are not lived in full health and come at a price: people suffer from other diseases, which increases health-care costs. Obesity prevention, just like smoking prevention, will not stem the tide of increasing health-care expenditures.

https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/46007081/Lifetime_Medical_Costs_of_Obesity.PDF

For further confirmation we can look to the fact that healthcare utilization rates in the US are similar to its peers. 

https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/salinas/HealthCareDocuments/4.%20Health%20Care%20Spending%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Other%20High-Income%20Countries%20JAMA%202018.pdf

One final way we can look at it is to see if there is correlation between obesity rates and increased spending levels between various countries. There isn't. 

https://i.imgur.com/d31bOFf.png

We aren't using significantly more healthcare--due to obesity or anything else--we're just paying dramatically more for the care we do receive. 

>Single payer/universal healthcare would go bankrupt in a day.

About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Obesity is linked to higher “bad” cholesterol and triglyceride levels and to lower “good” cholesterol levels. Obesity can lead to high blood pressure and diabetes as well as heart disease.

*Drinking too much alcohol* can raise blood pressure levels and the risk for heart disease. It also increases levels of triglycerides, a fatty substance in the blood which can increase the risk for heart disease.

*Tobacco* use increases the risk for heart disease and heart attack: Cigarette smoking can damage the heart and blood vessels, which increases your risk for heart conditions such as atherosclerosis and heart attack. Nicotine raises blood pressure. Carbon monoxide from cigarette smoke reduces the amount of oxygen that your blood can carry. Exposure to secondhand smoke can also increase the risk for heart disease, even for nonsmokers.

Diet is intrinsically linked to obesity and it is not a coincidence that as society ramped up industrialized farming and food processing that obesity rates spiked in the west. Moreover, a lack of physical activity combined with a car-centric urban design created the problem we now have (the suburbs have the highest rates of obesity).

You can argue as much as you want, but the fact of the matter is that obese people [live shorter lives](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-018-0210-2), have [poorer health outcomes,](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.amepre.2011.07.015) and require [medical intervention](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/surgical_complications_twelve_times_more_likely_in_obese_patients) more often. If I could have you scrub in for some cholecystectomies I prepare the OR for, you'll see that quite an overwhelming majority of them are not on skinny patients. 

Here's the deal, there is nothing morally wrong with being fat. I'm on the chubby side myself drinking a Dr. Pepper myself.  There's no need to pretend that it's neutral on health though. It is clear by every single objective health measure from complication rates, life expectancy,  rates of disability, and amount and cost of medical intervention that obesity is terrible for the human body. Your joints work harder to move more mass, your pancreas needs to work harder to create more insulin and digestive enzymes, your liver becomes fatty trying trying to process the excess calories, and your blood volume increases to support the new adipose tissue creating strain on the heart, lungs, and vessels. You will seldom find a doctor not recommending diet modification, increasing physical activity, and behavioral counseling because they have seen the consequences.",2024-03-09T00:00:25+00:00

I understand nutrigenomics is a heavily underfunded yet important issue and that high carbohydrate high sugar diets effect the hunger hormones of individuals differently. Hunger hormones by evolutionary design are hard to resist because you will die if you do, therefore it clearly is not a moral failure. Changing up macros and eating larger amounts of fiber and healthy fat can reduce these hormones to a healthy level, however in western society time to cook and the increased expenses of healthy food are a commodity and not everybody has access to these benefits. I do wonder though if there are going to have to be heavier consumer restrictions if we did move to a single payer model though like in other countries.

The ACA allows for insurance companies to charge smokers up to 50% more (or premiums that are 1.5 times higher) than non-smokers through a tobacco surcharge. States got to decide the level of surcharge, with Arkansas, Kentucky, and Colorado adopting a 20% or less charge. Surprising for Colorado, as it's considered one of the ""healthiest"" states. There isn't a consideration for smokers, it's a behavior surcharge, either you smoke or you don't. Doesn't matter the reason why. Being obese might be viewed in the same way. 

Americans hate taxes and hate being told what to do. Taxing cigarettes and adding surcharges to insurance costs is one thing, when cigarettes have been proven to be bad all around and there isn't a way to spruce up a cigarette into a health movement. Or is there? Vaping was advertised as a stop smoking aid and now we have teenagers who would have never picked up a cigarette vaping like there are no consequences. There aren't vaping surcharges.

Healthcare,post,1b9rvor,NoCarob5,Preventive Care Visit - What to say/do to make it a free visit,"Hi everyone,

My parents want to go in for a preventive visit. But their coworkers have been saying they all end up with $600-900 medical bills. Please help.

&#x200B;

Background: We're an immigrant family who live in the Midwest (US). We watch our expenses closely. My parents are both around 60, work at the same place and have the same insurance under Bluecross Anthem.

A few of their coworkers went for a preventive/physical this calendar year and all ended up with a bill ranging from $600 to $900.

&#x200B;

My question: What should they say/do during the visit to make sure they don't come home with a bill like their coworkers?

What's the best way to know exactly what is covered and what is not covered?

I'm very willing to call the insurance company and ask them. But I have called them in the past with other questions and the answer was never definite enough or would give me a good sense of certainty. We've been hesitating to see doctors even for a preventive visit, not knowing if it'd be a $0 or a $1000 bill.

One time I went in for a physical myself (29yo male) and I told the doctor I'd like to take whatever tests that are free of charge. The doctor, who was a very nice person, told me she could not tell me which one would be free. So I decided not to go through with any tests.

&#x200B;

Appreciate any insights. Thank you.",2024-03-08T16:13:58+00:00
Healthcare,comment,ktxr0r2,konqueror321,,"It is really up to the insurance company and state law to decide exactly what they will allow, and also the Doc. Basically 'prevention' means to gather information and offer testing that is recommended to help improve health outcomes. [Here](https://www.anthem.com/preventive-care-results/?gender=male&agecategory=50-64) is a webpage from Anthem that lists stuff they consider 'preventive' for a 50-64 year old male - you can click on a line in the page and change the demographic. 

DO NOT Bring up any health problems you are having, or ask for advice about how to evaluate or treat any health problems, or ask for a refill or prescription for some medication. DO TELL the Doc you are here for a preventive health exam ONLY and let them lead the visit. Tell them to do whatever they (and your insurance company) think is 'preventive care'.

If you mention some symptom you are having, or ask a question about some illness you have, or ask for a prescription, that will likely trigger ""evaluation and management"" services, which are NOT a part of prevention. Depending on the Doc they may submit a separate code for the ""evaluation and management"" part of the visit that will allow a charge (ie pay for the services). Many doc's will not provide 'evaluation and management' services during a 'preventive' health visit without somehow getting you billed for it. 

As far as tests go, that may be tricky, and dependent on your insurance. For example, the USPSTF recommends 'counseling' men (ie having a discussion with men) about the benefits and risks of having prostate cancer screening done - but if a man decides to have a PSA blood test done, is that also covered as 'preventive'? It should be but a cheap insurance company could allow you to be charged. ""Most"" insurance companies and ""most"" states will pay for the PSA blood test (as a part of prostate cancer screening), but ""most"" is not necessarily ""all"". 

Tests that could be considered as preventive, depending upon gender, age, and when last done include: fasting glucose for diabetes, PSA blood test, hepatitis C blood test, colon cancer test (ie colonoscopy or stool sample for blood etc), abdominal sonar (for aneurysm in smokers). If you are cost sensitive you might ask your insurance about these tests - are they free or completely paid by insurance if ordered by an MD for screening purposes?

But if you tell the doc ""I'm having trouble peeing"" and the doc orders a PSA, that is not screening and won't be 'free'!",2024-03-08T16:41:22+00:00

2) Don't have your own agenda, or ask questions.  99% of the time, people bring up stuff unrelated to the preventative health assessment, and medical advice, but then act shocked when insurance won't pay for it, and the office bills them for medical advice outside the ""free"" stuff.

I have personally worked in healthcare for 10 years and am actually a provider relations rep for a big insurance company (not Kaiser) the reason why my family has Kaiser is because my husbands work was cheaper than my works insurance (even though I work for insurance lol). My husband has some major GI problems. First his PCP refused to order necessary tests because he was ""too young"". Then he saw a doctor covering for his PCP who ordered the wrong type of test. So then we did another phone visit trying to avoid going back in to see if they could the right test, that doctor said he couldn't and needed to see PCP. So we called to try to get an urgent appt with PCP but next appt was in a month, so they recommended to maybe go to ER. So we did go to the ER because this is dangerous at this point. You know what the ER said? Your symptoms sound like cancer and you need to see GI. BUT I can't order anything for you or refer you to GI, you have to see your PCP. The earliest appt with the PCP is in a month! Telling a 31 year old that you may have cancer but I can't do anything for you basically? I'm BEYOND pissed. I basically yelled at the PA at the ER (not my best moment but I was pissed because I'm scared something is seriously wrong my husband).

Is this a Kaiser thing or is Kaiser this incompetent????

The medication is $5000 for a three month supply. They have already done peer to peer and appeals and been denied. I don’t qualify for patient assistance.

Any ideas or help. Thanks. Also there are no patient assistance programs that j would qualify for for this drug. ",2024-03-07T19:42:34+00:00
Healthcare,comment,ktx0ppt,fatedperegrine,,"Question - are you 100% sure during the peer to peer and appeals, your doctor has stated outright AND put it into your medical records and you are allergic to the medications that are on the formulary?  Also, are you 100% sure your doctor is the one handling the peer to peer and appeals?  Sometimes it is put on staff who aren't knowledgeable.  

Now, I hate to say this...but if your insurance is really doubling down...go to an allergist, tell them what is happening and ask if they will perform a monitored trial.  Take the meds with the allergist, have them document your reaction.  I'm so sorry for even suggesting it, but I know from experience that coverage of UC meds can just be total BS.  My SO had to go through purposeful failures of medications before he was able to get what he needed.  This gives you documented proof of an actual allergic reaction, not just hearsay.  If you have medical records with a documented allergic reaction to the drug already, get them and make sure they are included on any further appeal.  You may also need to look at the other drugs on the formulary, go to the manufacturer site and find the drug components, then highlight where the allergic item is listed.  These things will help build a case to say ""I CAN'T TAKE THIS, I'M ALLERGIC!!!!!""

You can also complain to your state insurance commissioner.  That won't help you quickly though.

Can your medicine be created at a compound pharmacy?  I ask, because my husband was also on a UC med that was inserted, and we couldn't get the medication covered because it was an off label use.  We got it compounded instead for SO much less.

Also, I wish you weren't embarrassed.  It's a disease, nothing embarrassing about it.  I'm so sorry you have UC, it sucks and the insurance system doesn't make IBD a easy to navigate disease.  I'm sending you all the kind thoughts and crossing all of my fingers and toes your provider and insurance can come together to get you the meds you need.",2024-03-08T14:06:03+00:00

Healthcare,comment,kts08ya,HIPAA_University,,"The biggest issue with telemedicine is reimbursement. 

Doctors think they should get paid the same amount for virtual and in-person, and insurers think they should cut the reimbursement because it’s more efficient, eliminates overhead, and a doctor (in theory) could see more patients. 

This creates somewhat of an impasse, but I do think there will be progress here and there has been. The “progress” is more so finding a middle ground with docs, and there are ways to incentivize doing telemedicine, and create trade offs, even if the reimbursements are cut, and the payors (insurance companies) are starting to figure that out, which you kind of alluded to in the OP. 

I think it’s exciting and opens up access for a lot of people with non-acute ailments (mental health, get the flu, have a rash, stuff like that) and that’s always ideal. Just need to nail down how reimbursement is going to work for these providers and then it will become a lot more common.

This is a very simplified analysis of what is happening in that sector, and there are MANY other things that are both driving as well as hindering telemedicine becoming more common, but reimbursement is the big one.",2024-03-07T15:29:35+00:00

Healthcare,post,1b8ads3,AgumonGreymon,Is Emergency Care bad in all hospitals or just in the hospital chain I go to?,"We have insurance with Kaiser Permanent (KP), and in the past 2 years my wife and I have been to the Emergency room a few times. Every time we've gone, we check in, and then are told to wait. Sometimes we wait for 40+ minutes just to be triaged, other times we were moved into a secondary waiting room and weren't triaged for 2 hours.

One time I had an obstruction in my throat, could barely swallow. I didn't see a doctor until 2 hours after I checked in, no triage done, only got attended to a good 4 hours after checking in. 

We've had similar experiences going to KP Urgent Care. I had a deep cut on my finger, I was bleeding pretty bad. KP told us we'd have to wait 3 hours to see a doctor because we didn't have an appointment. We drove 2 minutes to Stanford Valley Care and in stark contrast they triaged me super quick and I got a nurse to help stop the bleeding almost immediately, after which I saw a doctor 30-40 minutes later to do some checks and get someone to do my stitches.

Urgent Care and ER are different but this experience made me question if I've been paying a premium for sub-par healthcare. Are other hospitals better than Kaiser when it comes to Emergency? What's the purpose of Emergency if we have to wait hours for someone to see us? What is the emergency room experience like in other hospitals? ",2024-03-06T20:32:14+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kto1sdi,floridianreader,,"At Urgent Care clinics, you get in first come, first served like how most other businesses operate. Bob comes in first, then you, then a woman with a sick kid last. So Bob is seen first, then you, and lastly the woman with the sick kid. 

At the Emergency Room, they triage people not on first come, first served, but on who is the most likely to die or the most critical first. So we'll say that Bob comes in first with a broken leg, then you with a bleeding finger, then the woman with a sick kid last. Plus the thing with the ER is that they have the ambulance entry for patients who come that way, sometimes you may never even see them in the waiting area, they are treated and go straight to the back. So the emergency room nurses and doctors are trained in triage, which is categorizing patients based on who is most in need, who is most critical. 

The ambulance may bring someone who is receiving CPR; that patient is the single most likely patient to die, so he is going to get all of the care first. Then when they are done taking care of him, they will reassess the situation. They still have you and Bob and the sick kid, and if someone comes by ambulance. The sick kid came last, but if he's having problems breathing, he's going to go next because they don't mess around with people who can't breathe. And probably then Bob, and then you. Assuming no one comes in on the ambulance that isn't super critical. At the ER, who came in first doesn't matter. It's what their condition is that matters. And if your condition is a matter of life and death, you're going to go right back, whereas if you go in for an ingrown toenail, you're going to be waiting a while.",2024-03-06T21:09:12+00:00

It sounds to me like you’re using the emergency room and urgent care when maybe you really shouldn’t be. Or maybe you have unrealistic expectations about what your experience should be.

Once a cast was put on in the waiting room & the patient “discharged” from there. 

In my experience, Kaiser is overall lower cost (insurance prices plus out of pocket costs), and perfectly average across the board (with some variations for specific individual providers as all groups have a few bad apples), unless and until you have a super complex injury or diagnosis.

Healthcare,comment,ktny95n,jkh107,,"Last time I experienced the ER was when I had my gallbladder infection in 2009. They were super busy. I arrived at 4 pm, sat in the waiting room for a few hours, finally got called back around 8 pm and got some tests run at about 10-11 pm and they admitted me about 3 am. I had Kaiser but there aren't any Kaiser-owned hospitals in the mid-Atlantic region, it was a contracted hospital owned by a Catholic healthcare organization and is pretty typical for this region. 

My experience is that with Kaiser Urgent Care you can also wait a few hours unless you're sick/injured enough to be triaged first. That's probably because ALL the local Kaiser patients have to go there, whereas if you go to an independent Urgent Care clinic they are set up to  (and do) handle far fewer patients per clinic. On the upside, the local Kaiser Urgent Care clinic to us is an Advanced Urgent Care which is more like a mini-ER 24-hours, can admit patients up to 48 hours I think-- were able to treat a family member's kidney infection onsite overnight without going to the hospital, and follow-up is integrated into the experience, so that's pretty impressive to me.

I took two people on separate occasions to Newton Wellesley hospital ER (I mention the name, because these are very high cost of living suburbs of Boston).  Both times NEITHER PERSON WAS TRIAGED.  We just waited until our ""turn"" (I guess)  to go in...so so much for the theories on how ERs work. 

I worked in a hospital in Boston when I was in school, and I knew a person with medical training (a nurse or PA) would triage everyone who came in---there are symptoms you need training to know are dangerous. This did not happen either time I was at the Newton Wellesley hospital ER. 

On one night,  there were two people (including the person I brought) senselessly writhing around on the fucking floor moaning in pain.  We were the only people in the waiting area. THe only hospital people in the waiting area were two ""secretaries"" who had no medical experience.  I know this because I asked if one was a nurse.  SHE LAUGHED. 

With my sister, it was a very slow night in the ER - it was mostly empty, and when they took my sister back, there was ONE patient in the exam area - it had about 15-20 beds.  When I ran out to my car (in the middle of a dark, rainy night) and came back in, the secretary moaned to me that she had a rough night.  I burst into tears.  I felt like I was in some bizarre third world country and that everyone was a moron.  I thought my sister was going to die.  My sister could no longer walk, and was in horrible pain, and when they finally took her back she had insanely high blood pressure.  

NEVER TRIAGED, not one person with any training looked at her until she was wheeled in the back.  

And if you apologists fucking try to tell me there were emergencies we had no knowledge of, when we got to the back, I heard two people talking about how it was a weirdly slow night. 

Some places just suck, some places nickel and dime us so much that they don't train staff or hire trained staff.  Medicine is a for profit industry---even so called ""non-profit"" places are hosing us. 

If you don't know what I am talking about with the non-profit bullshit:  when I worked for a ""non-profit"" health insurer, every year, the entire sales and marketing department (about two hundred people) would decamp to the Chatham Bars Inn for a three-day paid company retreat.  We had three days of meals and activities all paid for by you the consumer (thanks!!) and Chatham bars Inn is one of the most expensive hotels on Cape Cod.

If you are waiting in the ED, it's because the ER is full of patients that need to be admitted to the hospital but can't because we have no beds. So there's an entire clog in the system.

Healthcare,post,1b7k07f,confuzeddeer,Signing up for health insurance outside of open enrollment,"Let me give some back story before I get to my initial question. I turned 26 in November of last year which unfortunately meant I had to get off of my parents insurance and on to my own. I had originally searched for marketplace insurance as my work insurance was very expensive. I ended up falling in to a MultiPlan type coverage (I understand that is not marketplace insurance) which come to find out is a total scam as it is not true health insurance. I spoke with a licensed health insurance agent last month who got me signed up with a health insurance plan through “Freedom Life Insurance Company, a USHealth Group company” which is supposedly a United Health Care company. My question is, is this a legitimate health insurance company and am I on a health insurance plan now? I’ve been told countless times I can’t sign up for health insurance outside of open enrollment without a qualifying event. However the agent was able to get me signed up where I am now. Any advice or opinions are appreciated.

Healthcare,comment,ktkf04j,chickenmcdiddle,,"A health share is right there next to what OP has now--largely useless in that there's zero mechanism that compels the health share to pay a dime for anything. Health shares, fixed indemnity plans, short-term plans, or anything that *isn't* qualified coverage per ACA standards can and will leave members holding the bag when the bills come rolling in. That, and they all take us back to the pre-ACA world where pre-existing conditions can and will be used against members.  

OP, the plan you're covered under now (via USHEALTH Group) is a fixed indemnity product. This is not comprehensive insurance. This is a fixed reimbursement program. This is virtually no different than the plan you dropped. It may sound great at first, but consider this redditor's experience and the massive bill they were left with thanks to their indemnity plan: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1b41nk8/insurance\_broke\_apart\_the\_majority\_of\_charges\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1b41nk8/insurance_broke_apart_the_majority_of_charges_for/)

An indemnity plan is best left to supplement comprehensive coverage (aka ACA-qualified coverage). I'd recommend you take a look over on r/healthinsurance and run some searches for USHEALTH or Freedom Life--you'll find countless stories of folks in a similar situation who've come to realize the same thing you're wondering.

When people refer to ""open enrollment"", they're referring to one of two things: the time frame that you can enroll in your employer's benefits, or the time frame that you can enroll in plans through [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov). The federal marketplace uses an open enrollment period of November 1 through January 15. Some states have slightly longer enrollment periods.

When it comes to employer and [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov) plans, you CAN gain access to them OUTSIDE of the enrollment periods by experiencing things called Qualifying Life Events. These are things like marriage, divorce, loss of coverage, birth, moving to a new state, etc. There are also some affordability QLEs in place, too. Your employer coverage being too expensive can actually be a QLE for [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov). The great thing about the federal or state-based exchanges is that premiums are almost always subsidized, and if you're shopping for a silver benchmark plan, you can qualify for cost sharing reductions, which severely reduces the deductible and out of pocket maximums. 

How much money are you estimating you'll make in 2024? There's a financial trigger for year-round enrollment for the federal marketplace for folks who make at or under 150% of the federal poverty level. Tangentially, Medicaid has year-round enrollment and is for anyone who may qualify for the program (which is state-based, and not all states are equal).",2024-03-06T04:53:54+00:00

Healthcare,post,1b6uybx,drewmanchu,Looking for services in California that support private healthcare providers navigating insurance companies & billing,"Hi all,

Long story short, I’ve been working with a fantastic therapist in CA who has recently come into some serious financial trouble.

He is an older gentleman who is not particularly skilled with web interfaces. Due to an increasing number of insurance providers going paperless, subcontracting to other billing services, etc. he has struggled to stay on top of his business. Late last year he employed a 3rd party service to handle his billing.

It appears that this 3rd party (an individual) has reneged on their business arrangement, failing to bill 80+% of his sessions over the past 4 months. 

He is now facing eviction and is financially destitute due to losing a majority of his life savings to a scam (there is a trend here). I am working to ensure my insurance company retroactively covers our sessions, but am keenly aware that I am out of my depth.

He has been a positive force in my life, and I hate to see someone working in mental health get absolutely shafted by his inability to keep up with technology and insurance companies terms of service. Yes he has been too trusting, and he accepts responsibility. However I don’t think this sweet old man deserves to end up on the streets.

Healthcare,comment,ktavd39,bostonglobe,,"From [Globe.com](http://Globe.com)

By Jason Laughlin

A commonly prescribed medication for children’s asthma is disappearing from pharmacists’ shelves, forcing parents and pediatricians to scramble for alternatives just as [allergy seaso](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/05/16/metro/its-not-your-imagination-allergy-season-is-longer-more-intense-nowadays/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)[n](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/05/16/metro/its-not-your-imagination-allergy-season-is-longer-more-intense-nowadays/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) is about to start.



In a move unusual for such a widely used drug, GlaxoSmithKline discontinued Flovent HFA, the brand name of its corticosteroid treatment fluticasone propionate, at the end of December. Critics, including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, say the decision helps the company avoid new Medicaid penalties going into effect this year for medications with price increases that outpace inflation.



“It was all very confusing, and we were left scrambling, trying to find out what we could do,” said Simone Fung, whose 5-year-old son, David, endured worse asthma symptoms over the past two months as the Cambridge family navigated confusing insurance policies and shortages of alternative medications to find a replacement for Flovent.

About 6.5 percent of Americans under 18 — well over 4 million children — have asthma, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/most_recent_national_asthma_data.htm), and Flovent has been one of the most common drugs prescribed for younger asthma sufferers.



In a letter Friday to GSK chief executive Emma Walmsley, [Warre](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj30Zzyp9SEAxWZE1kFHa_6AAMQFnoECBkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2F2024%2F01%2F26%2Fmetro%2Felizabeth-warren-senate-reelection-massachusetts%2F&usg=AOvVaw28APGdok_9V6SGp8zUil9N&opi=89978449&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)[n](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj30Zzyp9SEAxWZE1kFHa_6AAMQFnoECBkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2F2024%2F01%2F26%2Fmetro%2Felizabeth-warren-senate-reelection-massachusetts%2F&usg=AOvVaw28APGdok_9V6SGp8zUil9N&opi=89978449&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) accused the company of “price gouging” by killing its production of the widely used medication in order to avoid new government regulations that would have cost the pharmaceutical giant money. Instead, GSK has contracted with the drugmaker Prasco Laboratories to manufacture an authorized generic version.

“GSK has avoided accountability for aggressive price hikes on their life-saving drugs, and now, just ahead of allergy season, they’ve effectively ripped a go-to inhaler out of the hands of kids,” Warren said in a statement to the Globe Friday. “This is a shameful money grab that puts millions of children at risk.”



Warren’s letter linked GSK’s decision to stop manufacturing Flovent to the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, which requires drug companies to pay rebates that are more in line with their drugs’ prices starting this year.

The senator demanded answers from GSK by March 15 about the pricing of both Flovent and the generic drug and the impact of its decision to cancel the brand name version. Warren noted Flovent’s price increased almost 50 percent over the past decade.",2024-03-04T14:42:11+00:00

They will authorize the care on a prior authorization then send the claims to an outside company like Cotiviti, EXL or Optum who will then demand all medical records for a year or two at a time (against HIPAA, as it is not minimum information necessary) and find a reason to deny. There are several states where this is illegal to retrospectively deny authorized care. Another trick is they blow authorization requests for inpatient care, then deny stating the facilities did not attempt to authorize. If they do deny an admission and the hospital treats in observation, the insurance then denied observation care stating patient was in observation too long, yet they didn't want to pay as inpatient when patient was there more than '2 midnights'. When you call to get an authorization, some plans use outside companies that state the service does not need to be authorized then the claim denied for the authorization their third party vendor refused to provide, even when you appeal with the evidence in writing, insurance won't budge. You can also call these plans and 99 times out of 100 you are routed to an overseas vendor and speak to people who do not speak English and waste your time until they realized they fucked up and just hang up so you have to start the process all over again.

My husband has Aetna with 10K deductible that goes very quickly when he is in the healthcare system where the doctors cannot decide on not-so-complicated diagnosis ( infection vs. gout). Because of that my husband is currently in a hospital, for the 3rd time since December. He has been put on 6 rounds of antibiotics since then, first by his PCP, then hospital MDs. That didn't resolve the issue of substantial swelling and excruciating pain in the left arm. At some point my husband was denied an MRI, prescribed by an outpatient infection specialist, as a not necessary procedure, according to the insurance. I was writing about this on this subreddit 2 weeks ago. Interestingly, his first MRI was done during his stay in the hospital in December, but the MDs did not get to any conclusions!!! They continued giving him the prescribed antibiotics and discharged my husband home without resolving the issue, but promising that the medications work and he should continue taking them at home. 

Well, all the pills taken and nothing has changed.

 Now , the 3rd time around, my husband is in another hospital, bc same symptoms of debilitating pain and swelling. This time the doctors say 'gout', but who knows, the line for their MRI is so long nobody knows when it is going to be available.

I have health insurance through my employer and still can barely manage the co-pays and yearly out of pocket fees to actually use my insurance. It will come in handy when I’m hit by a f150 but even then if I can’t return to work and end up in the streets I hope the f150 kills me.,2024-03-03T15:35:12+00:00
Healthcare,comment,ktanl3x,daywalkerredhead,,"""Insurance is just legalized fraud at this point.""

Very true statement! I work in healthcare insurance authorizations and I battle these companies every day for them to give patients the full coverage they deserve. The companies go to all kind of ridiculous lengths to not approve care. There's a local hospital here that has, literally probably 1000s of their own insurance plans. The local hospital and it's offices won't even take their own plan cause of how shitty it is - like tell me how that's legal. The one plan is both Medicare and Medicaid - since Medicaid stopped paying for some service back in 2022, they put the full bill on Medicare, since Medicare doesn't think they should pay the whole thing, that remaining amount gets put back on the patient. That's insurance fraud 101! Especially when they have these fancy ass commercials saying, ""\*Insert insurance company name here\* gives me all the benefits and coverage I need!""",2024-03-04T13:48:31+00:00

Healthcare,post,1b39bt2,Jeffbak,Medicaid Reimbursement Rates ,"In Massachusetts, it appears that 9 low-income Steward Hospitals are on the brink of collapse.

Healthcare workers throughout NY state are protesting Medicaid reimbursement rates.

As someone who hasn’t worked in healthcare, I can appreciate the fact there is much I don’t know. However, sometimes an outside perspective, coming from someone not as in the weeds, can be helpful so here is mine:

Steward was gutted by Private Equity (PE), so it is not really in the best position to advocate for higher reimbursement rates. That said, let’s think about this for a minute: the 9 hospitals it operates that are on the brink of BK, are also low income community hospitals where the majority of patients seem to be on Medicaid. If the government is only reimbursing 55 - 65%, and these hospitals don’t have wealthy patients whose private insurers can subsidize the hospitals operating expenses, the low income hospitals are undoubtedly going to suffer. Ultimately, with such low reimbursements, these hospitals can not operate sustainably, and this crisis will continue once Steward is out and a new operator is put in place. Also, whenever an operator goes bankrupt, consolidation is usually the outcome. This is the same consolidation that the government says they are trying so hard to avoid…yet their actions seem to telling a different story?

From what I can gather, after chatting with the doctors and nurses I know personally, the government likes to use Medicaid as a bargaining chip to keep healthcare costs down. Whether this is the truth, or they just don’t have the funds to pay for Medicaid, I will probably never know. However, for the sake of this argument let’s assume it is their “bargaining chip” to keep healthcare costs down. As a taxpayer, using our low income hospitals, and their patients, as pawns to keep healthcare costs down, is disgusting and unacceptable. In light of what is going on in her home state of MA, Maura Healey was just recently quoted saying that the low reimbursement argument is “hogwash.” As I noted, she was referencing Steward which has huge problems because it was gutted by PE, but to not at least acknowledge the fact that low Medicaid reimbursement is a major problem our country is facing, really goes to spit in the face of the tens of thousands of healthcare workers serving these low income community hospitals, as well as the low income patients they serve.

I’ve started noticing more and more healthcare worker groups and coalitions beginning to protest the artificially low Medicaid reimbursement rates. I believe NY healthcare workers all across the state are doing this as we speak. I am 100% in support of these nurses, doctors, and admins because they know where the real problems lie since they are in the “belly of the beast” day in and day out. 

While PE and Healthcare should definitely not go hand in hand, let’s hold our elected officials accountable in terms of reimbursing low income community hospitals. This is certainly an area I don’t mind seeing my tax dollars go towards. ",2024-02-29T19:44:44+00:00
Healthcare,comment,ksscx1q,Lab_Life,,"While the low reimbursement rates from Medicaid are a problem for facilities balancing services with mixed reimbursements there is also a major issue with preventative care and incentives not to use it.

Preventative care coverage and reimbursement are also not up to par. This causes primary care physicians to have very limited patient pool and patients have limited access to these providers. Sometimes accessable providers are quite far away.

Since going to a primary care or an ER costs the same for Medicaid patients this causes many to use the Emergency services as their primary care provider.  This strains these resources and ends up costing the tax payer much more.  The incentives need to be revisited.  We have Medicaid patients come in all the time to the ER for routine work, pregnancy confirmation, or COVID/flu tests because it's convenient and they don't have to pay anything.",2024-03-01T01:30:13+00:00

It isn't that difficult to find a PCP even on Medicaid (in most states). Most big hospital systems take Medicaid. One simple phone call and you can find a doctor that isn't an ER doctor.

> well they won’t have the money to pay the massive fines so my guess is they’ll continue doing what they are doing and sending them to collections also won’t do anything

In Michigan the inpatient hospital copay is $50, they could easily add a $50 fee for a ER visit that wasn't an emergency.

> you’d have social outreach all over the place. Offices would be sending cars to go pick these people up. Giving them cell phones so they can bill Medicaid for follow up.

Normal doctors offices don't even do that for patients with private insurance so no they wouldn't do that if Medicaid reimbursed at higher rates

For example, we recently added one of our departments. That's one facility/place of service application and one application for each provider that will bill through there.",2024-02-29T23:51:53+00:00

Healthcare,comment,ksvq47f,Sstagman,,"The benefit would be that during the credentialing process, insurance companies would be made aware if the facility is somehow unsafe (The same is for credentialing a provider.). For example, if we can't get an insurance certificate or if we bounce around from insurance company to insurance company or if they're having claims made in the past vs the recent past. Has there been a state survey? What were the results? 

Additionally, depending on the facility, it may be treated as a provider. For example, I work with rural health clinics. Sometimes we bill under the rural health clinic npi rather than the providers. If you're doing this temporarily, what you really need to be aware of is are there any recredentialing applications coming due. Most insurance companies will have you recredential every 3 years for each provider or facility (they have a form they'll have you fill out and essentially you're just updating for the last 3 years. It's not a complete profile). Also, you'll need to attest the provider directories for each company every 90 days and stay on top of your provider's caqh profiles. Don't be intimidated, it's not as bad as it sounds and if the insurance companies need something from you they will generally reach out.

It can act as a front desk and answer calls 24/7

You can set it up to just answer calls after hours

It can automate up to 80% of your customer service calls

You can use it to take calls from Inbound leads and book appointments on your calendar for you.

It can be used to replace the old school (press 1 for sales, press 2 for support) IVR systems that most people find annoying.

And it can also preform tasks across multiple apps like putting appointments on your calendar, texting people reminders, logging notes and changing statuses in your CRM or support ticketing system, etc.

We want every company to be able to provide instant support, 24/7 to their customers and make support tickets / wait times a thing of the past.

I'm looking for a few businesses to try it out

I'll give you 1 month free trial to see if you like it, no payment details required, and my team will help you get all set up and running.

Healthcare,post,1b13576,pokemondoctor4,Darkside of working in healthcare,"If this doesn’t belong here let me know but as a health care provider I wanted to say it:

This is a bit of a rant, but I feel like it needs to be talked about more. There are a lot of benefits of working in the health field, with the biggest one being helping people. However, there are some dark sides of being in the health field. There are typically long hours that need to be worked as well as countless amounts of paperwork. Most people see the side of health care providers where we are interacting with patients and doing what we do to help them. What they don’t see are the long hours spent in front of a computer doing patient charts, billing, talking with insurance companies, research for a patient, or continuing education to further our careers. The other part that people don’t see, and talked about even less, is the toll it takes on our mental health. The days when a patient might drop some heavy info on you or you have to deliver potentially life altering information. It is an unfortunate truth that each provider has a timer in their head and once they are done with their current patient, they have to reset their minds and act as if nothing happened. This way they don’t reduce the quality of care for the next patient. Whether people believe in energies or not, the provider is trying to pull negative energy off them and give them positive energy. This unfortunately means you might be giving some of your own positive energy (especially for those providers where physical contact is necessary [chiropractor, physical therapy, massage therapist, etc.]).

That is just what happens during the working hours. This doesn’t include the time when you get home and are left to process everything that just happened that day. The days where you get home and don’t have any energy left to even talk with your spouse. The nights where you can’t sleep because you are thinking about what someone said or if there was something more you could do for someone.

Finally, the other side that most people don’t see at all is if the providers themselves are struggling with their own depression, anxiety, or other mental health condition. We spend so much time trying to help others that we often forget to take care of ourselves. All of this is leading to what I want to say to my fellow health care providers: You are not alone. Continue to be strong, but don’t be afraid to be vulnerable and take care of yourself. Talk to someone, exercise, rest, take some time away, whatever you need to do to help yourself recover. If we don’t take care of ourselves, then we are not able to provide the care our patients need from us. To the loved ones of health care providers (family, friends, spouse): thank you for being patient with us as we might have a hard time vocalizing our struggles.",2024-02-27T04:40:38+00:00

I see services approved on a pre authorization only to be sent to a third party company who claw back the money because they feel that it's not medically necessary. Then it literally takes months to get the letter explaining why. This is especially annoying because it's illegal in my state. They will also ignore admissions when we do pre authorization requests so they can deny on the back end, also illegal.

Last Summer one day though, I couldn't even move out of bed to go pee, let alone the thought of going to work. I literally had enough strength to reach over to my cell and call out. Thankfully I'm not someone who does that, so my boss didn't care, but I hate that this field got to me like that. Our field is thinning out so bad with staff, on every level, so we're mostly all working the jobs of 5-7 people with less and less staff to accommodate what needs to be done. I know most of us work somewhere that your managers or head's of departments write policies and procedures to follow, yet, when times get tough, they have no clue where to even begin to apply any of it to actually help out.

I also find the battle of getting providers, again on every level from facilities to office level, to actually follow through and help their patients get the proper care - that's a battle that eats at me. I literally just had a patient's family call me yesterday cause they are in desperate need for their loved one and their PCP said if they want it to seek it on their own. They just need someone to listen to them, which I did, it wasn't even a long talk, it lasted all over 15 minutes and I then directed them on what they needed and who to call. (It wasn't something my healthcare agency provides) I called back to the PCP office today and informed them of what happened and the nurse told me that someone would call me later to see what more she could do to tell me to tell the family. I said, ""This is YOUR PATIENT! You have to take the initiative to want to help them, that's not my responsibility. Since they aren't active with our agency, I'm 3rd party, I can't do anything more for them.""  The nurse sighed and said, ""Fine, I guess we can't pass this along then ..."" I deal with forms of that every single day. Patients discharged from the hospital with IVs, wounds, etc and their provider won't sign or send orders then they are pissed we can't do anything.

That's a bingo.

In many cases, everything you described seems to be the inevitable conclusion of the system we have. Many big payors (United, Cigna, Aetna, etc) are public, for-profit entities, *with a fiduciary duty to maximize value to the shareholders*. 

From the perspective of these payors, all of the inefficiencies, denials, appeals, ignoring correspondence, communication challenges, and straight-up crime are *not bugs, they are features*. With the top objective being shareholder return, it is impossible for the patient to be the priority. The incentive is not there: love it or hate it, that's capitalism. 

I, for one, fucking hate it. Like others in the thread, I've been in this industry for 20 years (paramedic -> clinical researcher -> MPH -> analyst for regional healthcare system), but have been increasingly questioning my purpose and future in a such a barbaric system that is so misaligned with my core values.

Makes sense if the total cost of care is jumping, pay rates are dropping, stars and coding getting tougher and they can get premiums that exceed expenditures with less downside (potentially). This spot isn't really my area of expertise, so take me with a grain of salt.

Healthcare,post,1azb0w9,cryptoconniption,Was I kicked out of my hospital bed early (2x) because of no insurance?,"Almost three years ago I got covid in a small town of 5k and wound up in a little regional hospital.  After about a week I got a call from someone demanding my insurance info and badgering me about payment. I told them I was on the verge of death and that I would look into it if they'd call back in a week or so when I felt better.  I was too sick to research the problem.  I finally had to block their number.

Later I would find out my insurance ran out after a week and I was supposed to renew it but since I was so sick I overlooked that notice so I became uninsured while laying in the hospital bed.

After two weeks a hospital administrator barged into my room like a whirwind, ""Okay, get up, you're leaving today!""  She was with someone from Lincare to teach me how to use my oxygen tanks.  This was totally out of the blue.  I begged them to allow me to stay saying I still felt too weak and sick. She wouldn't hear of it.  The Lincare guy tried teaching me to use the oxygen but I couldn't follow him: Everything was too fast and confusing.

The nurse loaded me into my truck that had been in their little ER parking lot and stuffed the tanks in with me.  She didn't ask if I had anywhere to go or anyone who coudl help me.  So I drove back to the motel I was staying hoping my belongings were still in my room (which I had been paying for the whole time).  I accidentally drove off the highway twice!  I kept forgetting I was driving and just spacing out and wound up 10 yards off the highway in the tall grass.   I thought about calling the police to come get me but I didn't know how to tell them where I was. I made it to the motel but I don't remember how I got my main o2 tank up to my room (it was too heavy for me to carry).

A week later in the motel my lung collapsed.

I wound up getting an emergency operation at the same little hospital and woke up in a larger hospital.  My lung collapsed again.  After about two weeks the doctor said they were sending me home.  I begged them not to (this again!) saying I was too weak.  Fortunately my father (a retired surgeon) was now with me and we both demanded that I stay.  They gave me one more day.  On that day, the day they were kicking me out, my lung collapsed again.  I would have been at a new hotel 45 minutes away from the hospital if I hadn't insisted they let me stay.  They did kick me out, early again, but this time I only had one trip back to their ER.

Anyway, I started thinking this all happened because I didn't have insurance.  I know my bill came out to over 200k but I also know that the hosptial was paid (medicaid rate, I think) because of the CARES Act.

I was just curious to know if I was getting the shaft.  Is this common practice?  Thoughts?",2024-02-25T01:06:31+00:00

Healthcare,comment,ks08wqa,konqueror321,,"""Utilization review"" is a process that payers (insurance companies) demand from hospitals. Hospitals want to get paid for the care they provide - if they don't get paid, they can't pay their employees or maintain or update equipment, and will eventually go broke (or so they claim). So nurses with clipboards watch admitted patients every day to ensure that their care is progressing and will be reimbursed by insurance. 

If you have no insurance company then the hospital would really rather that you leave immediately, or yesterday if possible. The hospital knows that it is  unlikely that they will ever be re-imbursed for the care they provided. I have no idea if or how the CARES act paid for covid related hospitalizations, but I would presume that the hospital administration felt that the reimbursement would not cover the costs of your care. 

All of this is how American health care financing is designed to work - it is not a mistake or an aberration, is is exactly what federal and state legislators want. Health care is capitalism and a profitable business, sucking money out of sick and suffering citizens who are unfortunate enough to become ill and need care. Anything that limits the profitability of care will be allowed to be halted, to the greatest degree possible. No insurance? No ability to pay? You better have a good lawyer on call or you will be forcibly discharged to the mean streets. Hospitals have put persons in taxi cabs and had them shoved out of the taxi across town in some other hospital's zone. 

It's just business and the bottom line. Welcome to America! You should have thought about this when you decided to get sick and not have adequate insurance or wealth to pay for your care, freeloader!  /s",2024-02-25T01:45:38+00:00

Healthcare,comment,ks5p9ib,srmcmahon,,"Most likely too late, most states have a 2 year limitation on malpractice suits. Also, unless there has been permanent injury or death, malpractice lawyers will not even look at it. I am helping a family member with a lawsuit against a hospital (admin not doctors, along with one nurse) for intentional infliction of emotional distress. We got a nursing board action against a nurse for abuse but the hospital  refused to acknowledge or investigate the abuse when it was reported properly to administration (that in itself violates federal rules that apply to any hospital that receives medicare payments, even if the patient is not on medicare). But they are doing it pro se. Reason is that the cost of litigation against a hospital is steep, and unless there is a large payout law firms cannot risk the cost of such litigation.    


Besides which, legislation was passed in most states during the pandemic severely limiting their exposure to medical malpractice during the pandemic because they were up against a major public health disaster. You could see if your state hospital licensing agency accepts and investigates complaints against hospitals even though it's been a long time (in my state there is no formal process requiring them to investigate a patient complaint other than EMTALA complaints, which they have to report to Medicare).

I'm trying to decide if it's worth switching into human healthcare for a better living wage. (I'm looking for something that makes at least 50k a year since my partner and I want to have kids and will need to be able to financially support them) I know I would need to go through schooling or a certain program and this is where the problem lies. 
I currently have a bachelor's in biology although most of the classes are almost 10 years old or older. Most of the health care programs I've looked up are in person only. And the last issue is that my husband is military and that means we move around a lot and currently we will be forced to move in 2 years. 

I've looked into nursing but most of the programs would take longer than 2 years to complete and from what I've heard would not transfer to another school. 

I'm trying to get more info on well paying careers within human health care that would have a short schooling option. Online or hybrid classes would be even better as I live in the middle of nowhere in my current state. 

So far I've looked up nursing but can't find a program I could complete in time.
I've looked up radiology and found it hard to find any school near me that I could complete in 2 years or less. 
So far the only short schooling I can find would be for surgical technician although the pay for that is much lower.

Looking for any ideas or insights that may help me out!

I DO NOT want or need Big Brother to protect me from myself and I reject the idea that non-smokers and the government should make my decisions for me. Once a Menthol ban passes, a total ban is next.

Healthcare,post,1awv3nw,mlt-,Can R63.5 be coded outright?,"Hello! I'm on the receiving end of healthcare. I got a coding related question.

Can R63.5 for abnormal weight gain be coded outright during an annual well exam based on patient's words alone? My wife got that surprise. A clinic says that they have a weight record from 5 years ago and that alone with the fact she casually mentioned weight increase during well exam, triggered that code that resulted in non-preventive visit and lab work. We are on HDHP.

Should the clinic *screen* for something first before using such diagnosis code outright? It is just about 10 pounds over 5 years wouldn't be ""abnormal"". Is it? It did fluctuate up and down in between due to pregnancy, but they have no records for that period.

She inquired about the change for birth control pills due to water retention (all other factors such as diet, lifestyle etc staying same) and it all went downhill from there.

Do I have any leverage into talking with the clinic to remove R63.5 and use some screening only code? It has been almost a year since we started this ping-pong and they wouldn't budge.

Is there a definition what is ""abnormal weight gain"" for 5 years gap in measurements?",2024-02-22T02:31:36+00:00
Healthcare,comment,krk4wuq,blackicerhythms,,"The medical record documentation needs to fully support the guidelines required for that diagnosis code. Patients word is not sufficient in this case when the place of service is a physicians office with the expectation of adequate equipment to perform a preventive/wellness visit. 5 years from the last data point would also be deemed insufficient. 

Besides ethics, accurate medical history and provider trust, I strongly doubt this will affect your out of pocket costs or future eligibility and benefits with your carrier. I also don’t think there’s a high probability of affecting future medical decision making based on this one code. 

A provider can change a claim and submit a corrected claim for insurance, but I doubt this dx code will affect your plans benefits at all.  They can’t change their visit notes once signed. Only add an addendum.",2024-02-22T03:49:17+00:00

Healthcare,comment,krlq2fi,ironicmatchingpants,,"If you discuss anything other than preventative care at your annual visit, you get billed for it. Plain and simple. Not coding an encounter as more than a preventative visit (basically reviewing shots and age related preventative screening only) when more topics were discussed (however briefly) is also fraudulent billing. 
If you bring something up, the provider can not just ignore it and is bound to address it, at which point, you've basically entered the zone of the medical decision making for each question you ask. You say weight gain, now we need to see if it's normal/abnormal, does anything need to be done about it, how much is it, and what downstream or causative things do we need to test for. It may come to no additional testing, but there's a thought process and training involved to get to that decision. Esp in your wife's case, where she was discussing medication related weight gain and expressing that lifestyle etc is stable therefore actually making it concerning for being abnormal weight gain. 
You bring up snoring, and now you need to be triaged for work up vs. no work up for sleep apnea and hypertension. 
Sorry, but that's not only preventative care. It's diagnostic work at this point and triggers medical decision-making codes. If a simple Google search is not sufficient to clarify your question and you need to ask a provider, then you're using expert knowledge and paying for it.",2024-02-22T13:18:38+00:00

With high deductible insurance plan, it is all pretty much out of pocket unless preventive visit. I don't mind to pay when it is due and I did pay for office visits and lab works in the past, but it seems this one should not be the case.",2024-02-22T04:22:22+00:00

Healthcare,comment,krlxzxp,mlt-,,"What I'm trying to say, they can't claim *abnormal* gain without a basis. Also, for snoring, you indeed need a sleep study and not a CBC and TSH tests. It is irrelevant in my opinion. Also, there are dedicated codes for birth control medication management. They didn't use any.

I went to another provider for my annual. I complained about TSH levels in the past. They did code it as screening and not abnormal thyroid function. The follow up visit for me was different. I had to pay and I have no problem with that. For my wife's case, it seems they jump to conclusions too fast as how to code.

I came across this textbook [1]. Here are a couple of quotes about *abnormal* weight loss R63.4 study case

> Significant unintentional weight loss is defined as > 5% loss of usual body weight in the last 6–12 months

You'd think they should have the measurements within the past year as a basis.

> First, the weight loss should be documented if possible; 25–50% of patients that complain of unintentional weight loss have not in fact lost weight (and do not need to be evaluated for causes of weight loss).

It seems unsubstantiated to blindly take a patient's word for it as there might be no change. There was also a pregnancy in 2019 that that particular provider has no record of. It seems too far-fetched to use 5 year old weight as a basis when so many things in between could happen.

Healthcare,comment,krlyzab,ironicmatchingpants,,"Your wife is the one who thinks her weight gain is abnormal and linked to water retention from ocps etc vs normal from dietary indiscretion/lack of exercise. If a patient is telling me they're doing everything right and the same way with diet and exercise and still gaining weight , am I supposed to dismiss it as normal weight gain despite their claims of a stable lifestyle? Or should I look into it with labs, including thyroid testing? 

If you do the former, you're dismissive. If you look into it, you're overbilling.  

What I'm trying to say is, regardless of semantics, there would have been an add on charge to her visit as an E/M level 4 because of these discussions regardless of how it was coded. 

So you'd pay the same amount of money even if it was coded with the changes you recommend and the correct billing for medication review and counseling and snoring with or without a sleep study order but with documentation about the discussion.

Annuals are for mammograms, paps, vaccination checks, cholesterol screening, colonoscopy discussions, med reconciliation, Medicare screening questions, and reviewing ongoing need for meds you're already on. Anything beyond this, please be ready for a different code.

 If you have a doctor here and there who answers questions or orders other things without billing for it, consider it a favor, not the expectation. Sometimes, I code for just annuals, and the billing department changes it based on the other things that were addressed and documented.",2024-02-22T14:21:12+00:00

I see they coded CPT 99396, but Google suggest there is a ""three-year rule"" for established patients. So it is new patient by the book without reasonable prior weight data.

I don't think it qualifies as E/M level 4 from what I see on the web. Is there a ""history"" component for a new patient? There is no way to examine weight *change* in one go for a new patient.

Healthcare,comment,krm17hl,ironicmatchingpants,,"So it's a lab and insurance problem, not a doctor's office problem. Looks like the doctor coded to get paid for less work than they actually did. 

Tsh, cbc, and cmp, as well as even HbA1c, for some insurances aren't considered 'routine' lab work anymore like they were in the past. Providers code them under diagnosis so they WILL get covered under 'medical necessity'. 

You've paid already, but next time, always ask at the labs and imaging counters BEFORE you get tested if your insurance will cover it for the particular dx code or not. The codes can't be changed retrospectively. And even ask for how much lab/imaging would cost with cash pay vs using insurance. Some labs are actually dirt cheap but cost hundreds if you use your insurance to pay for them. Same for medication/goodrx. 

There are hundreds of mini insurances, all with their own rules, exceptions, and coverages. There's no way for your physician to know how to deal with each of them.

The insurance companies love to throw their hands up and shift the blame but they really should have one set of guidelines of what's considered covered for everyone and what's not considered 'routine lab work'",2024-02-22T14:35:38+00:00

It is close to impossible to get anything from the lab or provider regarding costs when going through insurance. But I get your point to inquire about cash price next time. It just seems in-network facilities should have something pre-negotiated.

I'd give a credit to Medica. They are upfront and very good at explaining things. They specifically point to offending code and suggest to request a ""coding review"" from the clinic.",2024-02-22T15:30:51+00:00

Apparently they don't purge data on a whim and I wouldn't expect that. Compliance & Quality Assurance team also mentioned the history (5yr ago) of iron deficiency as a justification to retest ferritin among other things billed. However Medica didn't mention any related DX code as how it was submitted besides those weight & snoring Rs.

As I said it is not like Medica just dodges questions. They explain it all. They would pay like they did for me if not that ""extra"" code. I have no reason not to trust Medica based on my experience with other providers and facilities.

I was seen at my provider for an annual after quite a gap (>3yr) as well. As I mentioned, I didn't have to pay for the visit and labs although I asked explicitly to check thyroid levels. I didn't pay attention how they coded. Perhaps they treated me as a new patient as well then and just screened for TSH in spite of me admitting past diagnosis.

There is no way for a patient to see those anywhere so I have to call Medica and ask how stuff was submitted to them.

From what I understand, Medica doesn't care much about DX code order. As I mentioned before, I had same lab work CPT codes from another lab for myself but without R-codes, that was processed as preventive alright.

I'm awaiting for Compliance & QA Team to get back to me. They also coded my wife as an established patient. I'm trying to reason them that they can't do that with 3+ yr gap in visits along with some other things.

It is just astounding the clinic can drag it for a year while incorrectly submitting *additional* claims instead of *corrected*. It is like a total administrative incompetence.

Healthcare,post,1avtkj6,ivyvinetattoo,Void Claim Request Denied - What’s Next,"I went to a physician Nov 2023. My insurance noted the physician was in network on their website. Upon arrival the physician requested some X-rays unexpectedly which I didn’t check if the facility or diagnostic was in network. It turns out nothing was in network for a total of 3 charges.

1- Physician
2- X-ray
3- Diagnostic Physician

The insurance covered #1 since it was a mistake on their end and they updated their website. It took some back and forth to complete but was done. 

Item 2 was not covered at all but put through my insurance noting out of network.

Item 3 was covered partially by insurance (some % but oon and goes under my deductible) then part by me then more by insurance unnecessarily.

Once I realized the debacle due to out of network items I contacted my insurance and the hospital. Turns out my policy and insurance states a few things:

A- Claims for diagnostic services, including X-rays, not pre-approved will receive a fine of $1000 per incident if it goes through insurance. 
B- I can request a void claim 90 days from the initial claim.

I’ve tried doing B for both 2 & 3 to avoid A. The hospital is voiding #2 but refuses to do it on 3 because they say it’s a closed bill due to it being paid fully. Technically if what they say is accurate insurance accidentally overpaid it. I’m now past the 90 days and I’m concerned. I’ve put so many hours and calls and as of late emails in to deal with this and I am frustrated.

What do I do next? Do I have any recourse here? What if my insurance does fine me the $1000 for #3? 



Also not related but FFS the online estimates are a lame duck. They provide CSV files I can’t even open or when I go through their online estimator my code doesn’t even pull. Random added rant.",2024-02-20T21:33:42+00:00

I’ve already spoken to (3) supervisors and each have been very unknowledgeable. I can only get through to billing supervisors and they tell me I am not allowed to speak with anyone in insurance due to their rules, the just don’t talk to customers period. The last one is the one that told me they can’t void claim due to it being already closed but of course others have noted it can be re-opened. I have no way of speaking to the same person twice unless they call me back which has taken anywhere from days to weeks. 

If I can’t void the claim based on the fair lookup, I checked, by law they have to provide information. They provided it but not in a format I can access. The law does not state I have to be able to access it. But I do find it super odd that between their two locations they have different $ for different services and through interpolation the cost of the X-ray is at least 20% higher than expected.

Healthcare,post,1avtjw5,Objective-Meaning438,Medical no -compliance?,"Hello,
We just got a new PCP and unfortunately missed one appointment got charged a late fee. I told them we’d have to reschedule some appmnts because we can’t afford copays PLUS a $50 late fee. 

We got a reply from the PCP’s office saying that if we rescheduled too many appointments, they would consider this medical non-compliance. And this is beyond the whole 48 hours notice thing, meaning any rescheduling of too many appmnts.

Is this normal? Is there some kind of consequence of having a record of medical non-compliance other than being ‘kicked out’ from this doctors care?

Clinicians are trained how to work with patients. They will save lives, but then they are required to sit at a damn computer and write a book report detailing what they just did. Software is mostly a source of frustration for them. If you want to train them, their time needs to be reimbursed as mentioned above.

Healthcare,comment,krbml2q,OtherwiseGroup3162,,"I am in healthcare consulting and have been on the provider side, and insurance side. I want to put it out there that I believe the biggest issue with sky rocketing costs are caused more by the insurance companies than hospitals. Look at the stock prices of insurance companies, United Healthcare in particular for the past 10-15 years.  A lot of hospitals do not actually make a lot of money. There are many years they lose money. 

All of this being said, if someone does not have insurance and has a hospital stay, it is basically unaffordable - to sometimes being lifetime debt in the hundreds of thousands. So the key is for everyone to be insured. How that happens is not what I want to speculate on, but just saying that if you are not insured, and have a hospital stay, you're screwed.

High hospital costs have a couple of reasons, but full charged amount (what you get charged without insurance) is very high for a couple of reasons, one being rates with insurance companies.

How contracted rates work, is the insurance company has a contracted rate with a hospital. If the hospital CHARGES less than that contracted rate, the insurance company pays only that charged amount instead of the full value. This is called 'Lessor Than' Language. This incentivizes hospitals to charge more for each service, just so they don't get paid less than their negotiated rate. They actually don't care about charged amount, even if you don't have insurance, you can ask for discounts and they will give them to you since charges are just pie in the sky numbers.

Hospitals are not very good at negotiating rates because it is much more complex than you can imagine, especially on the Outpatient side. 

Making payments and rate logic more standardized would greatly improve efficiency and pricing, but insurance companies like to keep it complex. There are new laws in place to try and make these prices transparent (price transparency), but it is not going very well so far with the data that is out there.",2024-02-20T17:52:27+00:00

Some voting idiots think Health Insurance companies want to “keep the costs down” in “negotiated “ drug price, MD visits, and all the reimbursement rates… many of the same idiots don’t understand that in single payor, every doctor and provider is “in network”.

In reality, Health Insurance Companies (the payors) want healthcare to cost as much as possible because all insurance companies, not just health insurance companies, will/should make 2-3% annually of the total cost/expense of the value/price of what is “covered”, and will pass all costs onto the people paying for insurance, and will maintain that 2-3% margin no matter what.

It’s more profitable to make 2% of 1billion dollars than 2% of one million dollars per a static 1000 members buying into the policy, and if healthcare costs 1000 people one billion instead of 1 million dollars, it basically throws “not needing insurance and self insuring by having a healthy stash of cash” out the window for consumers, thus driving the demand and necessity for “insurance”.  

Ask yourself this.  Why can’t a middle class American buy into $0 deductible, $0 copay health insurance policy Medicaid gives to poor people?  I mean the middle class pays for Medicaid by paying taxes and can’t even buy into the same coverage we give to Medicaid recipients?

Me and my wife own a small business we make around $120 K Gross income  a year, We have owned our home for 5 years 

After 5 years of hard work we are finally starting to see profit from the business. we don’t have health insurance because we couldn’t afford it. That hasn’t been a problem because we are young and healthy. 

We recently found out my wife is 3 months pregnant, so we missed the deadline to get health insurance. 

When we had our son the bill was almost $30 K  but since we had insurance we ended up paying $5 K.
So I’m expecting the bill to be about the same this time around or maybe even higher since our son was born pre covid 

We recently went to Mexico to visit family and we went to a local maternity clinic to get an ultrasound, we asked them about the cost of giving birth in that clinic and they quoted us $600 for a normal birth or $1200 if it’s a c section. 


Paying $30 K will take us at least two years of savings, so we are seriously considering coming to this clinic in Mexico.

Any suggestions?",2024-02-19T15:58:50+00:00

Here’s the 411, shit stuck in ear bad, not the first time, this time is actual “something” the last time it happened was water. Point is startin to “chafe” and I have 0 clue what to do or where to go easily

Issue was the first time I went to get the gunk removed, I had to be ushered too by my folks. I was hesitant to go because I was POSITIVE I’d get some kind of overpriced debt over it. (I recently was paying off a car accident at the time and technically still am with a NOW sick dog)

I did tons of research AND called my insurance, they said they covered it and recommend and in network place and that I had nothing to worry about. Double checked again when I arrived and they said the same thing. Procedure was done and over and was charged 20 bucks

Got a letter in the mail that I “dine and dashed” and now owe 300 bucks when I had little money.

Called the insurance.

“Idk what happened, sorry man”

Asked around, my initial fears were true, this shit happens all the goddamn time to people.

TL;DR

Something (prob wax) has been stuck in my ear for awhile, , can anyone just name a place i can talk to so i can get it done for cheap in my area so I don’t vault further into debt?

I have basically no money now anyways btw and i’m debating on what to spend it on because it’s all essential stuff, just tryna weigh my options. paying anywhere from 10 to even 1000 dollars isn't so bad as long as you consented to it and knew what you were paying for from the outset",2024-02-19T03:14:05+00:00

Healthcare,post,1auc4ks,SomeGrumption,Who to call to actually get my dad his retirement money?," 

I don’t know all the details, so I know what advice is given will be moot, I’d just like to know where to start.

Essentially they’ve been saying since 2020, that once my dad goes into full retirement, he’d get the rest of his money, once that’s settled I become his paid caretaker. He was slott Ebro become one in 2021, then 2022.....see the problem here?

My dad honestly not the best person overall, morally and mentally. He's getting dementia and with all the other issues that come with aging his mind is obviously deteriorating being sad, sick and indoors all the time isn’t helping much.

My dad personality wise is a lot like moe Howard, Peter griffin, Homer Simpson, eddy from Ed edd n eddy etc.

Which means on his own, even before all this usually when he goes about solving his own problems with no one to reel him in, something gets horribly broken and nothing gets done in the process.

After getting beaten down all this time his new solution is to get money streaming porn online live. Y’know “goin Indy man, because I’m tired of people tryna surveill and censor me”...

Yeah.....this is 2 story house with 4 people and 2 dogs, no amount of a job or money we make alone can fix a systemic issues like this.

and obviously while i don't know what to do or have the answers, it isn't wise to just let him solve these issues on his own in good conscience anymore.

i work as a freelance artist, no school or anything as of yet, it wasn't intentional, it's just the role i adopted because everyone else is leaving or too irresponsible to help much. Issue is obvious now tho, can't go out much cause no money, job market is awful and even if i do go out and get one, my dads situation has detiorated so much that leaving him alone by himself for most of the day for years would 100% guarantee his death; i'd be getting more money, sure, but at what cost? part of all the money i've had goes to helping him out; and if i'm out and away like everyone else and he hurts himself and dies, what good was all that time and moeny for beyond saving myself??? And even then while helpful, everyone knows any job a guy like me could get at this time wouldn't be enough to pay for anything meaningful anyways,

So at minimum what can I do to get this guy his money so i can better take care of him and he can better take care of himself and others? Because if this continues, the only viable solution is collective suicide.

morbid statement ik, but when you’re in a situation that we are, we don’t even have to do things like that manually anymore. Poverty is already pushing us into depression and being ultimatum’d into making more and more self destructive choices to survive so we can continue living the bare minimum. we're all ALREADY dying.

Healthcare,comment,kr469kp,Environmental-Top-60,,"The solution is probably going through the process of getting a conservatorship. You need to bring him to the doctor and get the diagnosis established first. Don’t do it at a regular physical. Make a specific appointment to have a mental health evaluation at his PCP and get a referral to a geriatric psychiatrist. It may take a few weeks but you can start the paperwork while this is going on. This is literally what conservatorships are made for.

Here are some Reddit colleagues of mine that might have better insight. u/lizziemac123  u/warfrogs figured since y’all  work in benefits, you might have a little bit more insight here.

You need to do some digging and see what legal documents are in place, get dad to a geriatric psychiatrist and prepare yourself for the possibility of getting a conservatorship if your dad does not have the proper legal documentation. 

This will take some time. 

You can get a fee waiver for the conservatorship hearing and filing if you so need. Generally, after 60 days, you have to do an inventory of the assets, and that will be a little difficult to do. You’re going to need an extension on that probably.

I would start looking at the mail with his permission see if he is getting any statements such as 1099. 

I would also contact former employers to see if there is a place that has retirement accounts for him. 

I’m sure there is a service somewhere that gives you the opportunity to search a database of whether there are life, insurances and 401(k), etc. 

What state are you in? 

I’ve been through this before, so I know a thing or two. 

You were going to need a doctors visit with Dad and the psychiatrist within a certain period of time. If they try to charge you cash for it and say that it’s not billable to Medicare, they are incorrect. The disease process makes it medically necessary for a Medicare visit it is not considered administrative. They can bill that visit either as a comprehensive evaluation specifically for dementia screening, which they can do or they can do that as an established visit 99215. 

Treatment is going to either involve Memantine or donepezil. 

They may require an MRI, but depending on the physicians findings, it may not actually be necessary. They can diagnose dementia without one. if you are going to get that CT or MRI, scan, just know that you’re gonna look for atrophy on the brain, and that generally is a good indication of dementia.

Getting checked for urinary tract, infection, syphilis, deficiency, hypothyroidism, etc. are going to be things that are part of that process.

In my experience, a sudden worsening of symptoms is usually caused by UTI, but not always. 

UCLA has a great resource for demerit training online on YouTube and that is actually extremely helpful and dealing with a specific situation. 

After you figure out what the money situation is, I would start applying for public benefits, such as snap, QMB status if on Medicare, energy assistance if offered in your state. 

If you’re getting paid from the state to take care of him, that usually means that they will eventually be an estate recovery. Do your best to get anything that you can through Medicare, not Medicaid because Medicare cost sharing is not recoverable (despite what the state says) as well as premiums and deductibles. It does not mean you can’t, just know that depending on how long this goes on, the estate will be charged for the supplies and a markup which may be more expensive than buying from Amazon. 

If possible, daycare may also be an appropriate even part-time for the social aspects and keeping the brain stimulated.",2024-02-19T09:19:22+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kr4wdpm,RainInTheWoods,,"Money from who? Do you mean Social Security Disability Income (SSDI)? If so, call your local social security office to make an appointment. Go from there to  apply for SSDI 

If you mean Social Security because he is retirement age, call the same office as above.  He will have a case worker assigned. 

In either situation, you will receive USPS mail with drop dead dates for complying with what they request of you. Don’t wait until the last minute to meet the dates. Give them what they request as soon as you receive the mail. If you miss the date, call their office. You aren’t dead in the water, but you’ve slowed yourself down. Keep ALL of the mail in one place at home. Just throw it all into a box if need be, but keep it all in one place. 

Get a job. Some income is better than no income. In USD $12 per hour take home x 20 hours per week ~= $1000 per month. You already know it would help. 

It sounds like you are concerned about leaving your dad alone, but it also seems that he is high functioning enough to be employed. If you can’t leave your dad alone at this time (I’m not talking about some unknown time in the future, I mean now) and you don’t have family support to stay with him, then your dad probably needs to be evaluated for residential care. Contact your local social services department.  Another option is to contact 211 if you are in America, but they will have you contact your local social services department.  

If he has dementia, the long term goal is to petition the court for a conservatorship. The social services agency can help you get started with that. Sometimes i’s helpful to have the conversation with them now so you get some seed knowledge that you can ponder until it’s actually time to proceed with the paperwork. It’s a process; it’s not fast. There will be more steps. 

When you talk to a case worker for your dad, I encourage you to talk to them about getting mental health help for yourself.  If you are in America, 211 is a good place to start. There will be more steps for you to take after that, but it’s your starting point. Again America…you can also  call your county’s social services agency to ask about low cost or free mental health support. There will be more steps to take after that call. I encourage you to take them.

Healthcare,comment,kr80hga,warfrogs,,"Thanks for the ping /u/Environmental-Top-60.

So - my background: worked for a few years as a call center rep, moved up through various groups and now work in appeals and compliance with some QI duties - my primary population segments are Medicare (65+ population) and folks with special needs or disability. Previously, worked in a group home for folks with significant disabilities and deficits, and prior to that, worked in banking. On top of that, also **technically** a licensed agent for health, life, and accidental death and dismemberment, though I don't use that licensing and only did it to resolve complex issues that would otherwise require a licensed agent.

This is all stuff I've handled in the past.

You've got a ball of wax going on that has a few different options depending on the exact situation - if you can provide a bit more info, I can likely advise how to get the ball rolling on all of this.

To echo /u/Environmental-Top-60, your dad needs to have his faculties rated. If he's suffering deterioration or mental decline, that isn't a thing that gets better and will only get worse. You want to take action before it's reached a critical point to keep yourselves above water. I do want to counter one thing though.

I'd suggest not actually scheduling an appointment yourself with an MD for an assessment. First, reach out to your state or county's Health and Human Services group and ask what's required for a Medicaid application; you may also be able to find this online (or if you're willing to let me know what state and county you live in, or even ZIP, I can likely find this for you.) You're going to want to gather ALL of that stuff ASAP and apply. Since your dad is out of work, I suspect he's largely not-covered in terms of insurance. Another big thing you'll want to ask about, or again with more info I may be able to provide, is what the requirements for acting as a Home-Health Care Aid or PCA are for family. In my home state of MN, family can get special dispensation for providing these services, but in some states, you may have to be licensed or certified for PCA work and have an NPI and/or TIN.

If your father is already enrolled in Medicaid, that could be a holdup on you receiving any payment. That can also be unwound and handled, but I need to know a bit more info.

Prior to going through the guardianship or conservatorship process (which may be required but keep in mind, that is quite a lot to take on) - I'd suggest talking to your dad about making you his Power of Attorney or at the very least, CMS Authorized Representative. Depending on your state, you would not need to consult with an attorney or anything for a Power of Attorney - but YMMV. Most states offer free legal clinics that are great for things like this. You may be able to find a simple POA agreement by searching ""<your state> statutory short form power of attorney."" In MN, they're SUPER simple documents. Otherwise, you can access the [CMS-1696 Appointment of Representative](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/cms-forms/cms-forms/cms-forms-items/cms012207) form from CMS. An attorney is not required for this.

With these documents, you will be empowered to act on your father's behalf. You will likely need to send a copy (electronic or otherwise) to any entities you interact with, though this may be able to be shortcutted if your father is on Medicaid. A Power of Attorney will grant you ALL sorts of powers, including financial powers, while the CMS 1696 will only allow HIPAA-regulated entities to speak to you on your father's behalf. If your father has an active Medicaid enrollment, you can likely send a POA or CMS-1696 document to them and they will ensure that any entity they interact with directly will speak to you on your father's behalf. I would do that **immediately** as it will make your life **way** easier in the future.

Feel free to PM me if you want (though I do not suggest it) as some of this info may feel sensitive, but isn't any info that would put your father at risk. If you can let me know the following, I may be able to help further.

* Your father's age
* The state in which your father has his permanent residence (and county if possible)
* The specific funds that you're trying to access and their source
 * Pension
 * Short-term or long-term disability policy
 * Medicare or Medicaid covered benefits
 * 401k, IRA, mutual fund, stock options, etc. etc.
 * Other (Commercial or Marketplace primarily) Insurance benefits
* The nature of your father's condition
 * Specifically is the condition any of the following:
  * End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
  * ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease)
  * Disability due to on-the-job injury
* Current ACTIVE insurance enrollment
 * May include grandfathered healthcare policies
 * May include long-term and short-term disability policies

It's very likely that there are benefits and options out there your father would qualify for - but if you folks don't have a social worker to help out, you may not be aware of them.

If you can let me know that sort of thing, I can likely help further! Good on ya for stepping up to help your dad.",2024-02-20T00:40:48+00:00

the get a job thing is a no-go for now; i didn't choose this position, and my dad was never even that good of a parent.

&#x200B;

but a big part of why this house remains afloat in the first place is because both parents are incredibly irresponsible so a lot of the things that can't be bothered to be taken care of get swooped up my sister and i. Which is especially bad for me because i've pretty much spent my childhood playing adult and parenting my family, the situation sucks for me of course and is obviously unstable, but as long as i live here, it makes sense to help with the stuff that'll obviously self destruct if left untreated.

it's a diff story if i were unaware of this, but i feel if you KNOW something bads about to happen, and what little, anything you can do to prevent, you should probably do it, especially in my case. the fams a sinking ship, but as long as i'm on it, it's best to look out for icebergs on your way down.

my dad retired, BECAUSE of how much his condition is deteroating, he tried to do virtual teaching at the start of quarantine and he couldn't sit for that long

the amount of times i've come home or woke up from sleeping to see the guy face first with shattered glass everywhere is a bit too much to count

he doesn't do it often, but its enough to be alarming; ntm the amount of times i've caught some medical hiccup or oddity in the house, been told i was paranoid, only for an expert to come and be like:

my dad's mostly still here but that ""mostly"" a big asterisk my guy, driving off somewhere alone and forgetting where you were going isn't good, dude tried to clean a stain out of dish by accidentally making the chemical for mustard gas; only reason he didn't kill us was because i stopped him before mixing it for the final time.

&#x200B;

these examples are the extremes, but the fact that they happen at all and i've prevented several livelihood disasters single handedly isn't a good sign. I love art but i also wanna be a voice actor, a teacher of english, writing, an animator a preformer etc; but my family is incredibly shitty, incompetent and selfish. Me and to a lesser extent my sister are the only real assertive and proactive ones here, either of us leave now, we're screwed but more importantly, the rest of the family would IMMEDIATELY tank.

&#x200B;

i had an irl job for a little bit, it was honestly a good experience, the only one i had so far, but back then my dad's condition was better and (i don't quite remember) but i think my mom was there to help him out too, +my sister was home more often; but as she gets older and her desires and responsibilities grow, she obviously isn't gonna be home as often anymore. 2020 is almost 5 years ago dude.

i'd honestly love to get outta the house again, but doing that for a long period of time, would 100% end in me coming home to a corpse. and all that money would evaporate again, AND i'd have nowhere to go.

&#x200B;

\+given the current job market at least where i live, the amount of time dedicated to job hunting would 100% eat away from my art time (the only amount of income i got rn keepin the house afloat) took me half a year to get my first job and that was BEFORE the economy got worse; i was able to take a break from art then because i hadn't decent stable flow set up so i still made money even when not drawing

&#x200B;

i'll set up something like that again, but everything from freelance art, setting up that other form of income and applying for irl jobs AND watching my dad, are ALL jobs my guy.

&#x200B;

in order for that to work, i got to take a substantial amount of time out to invest, time i genuinely don't have rn. I'd love to live in a world where i set the other sources up in about a couple hours to a week, but i don't live in that world.

&#x200B;

if things workout i'll be his paid caretaker, but by then situation for him will also have stabilized and can take the time to look into getting a nurse or something to look after him while i'm away.

&#x200B;

idk, i'm sure you've been in similar situations, once you get a good read of your surroundings, you realize its not doomspiraling, but real things that can happen when not careful. you're ultimatum'd into a choice, no matter what you make you won't feel satisfied but its infinitely better than doing nothing. if you can do something LITERALLY right now, to make money and make your situation better, why not do it? That's what i face everyday.

&#x200B;

if you were in my shoes, you'd make some choices better, and some worse; but you'd ultimate come to a similar point of ""wow, these people are incredibly useless, if i lveave, i'm screwed and their screwed, and we're still screwed if i stay, but i can at least delay the inevitable"" i don't fault the mfs who see fmaily shit like this and just drop out and cut contact, homelessness or not, nor the ones who choose to stay like me. I weighed my options, and as of now i can NOT be ""that"" kind of a trailblazer.",2024-02-20T00:12:58+00:00

Healthcare,post,1au2h5g,Any-Lack1453,Difficulties With 15-Minute Appointment Slots,"I have a few ongoing issues that require more than a minute or two of review. When I see my PCP, there is often a lot to discuss. For example, I was given a diagnosis by a specialist recently and saw my PCP to receive more information/get her opinion. We spent the full 15 minutes discussing the diagnosis, and I still felt like it wasn't enough time.

I am planning on making an appointment for my annual physical. However, during past physicals, there never seems to be enough time for my doctor to complete both a thorough exam and answer questions about my health in just 15 minutes. I always leave the appointment with unanswered questions and worry that the physical exam was unthorough.

From my understanding, booking two back-to-back appointments is frowned upon, as the doctor would only be paid for one, but doing the work of two.

My doctor is also extremely booked, has stopped taking new patients, and is already taking appointments for 2025. I worry that making 2 appointments would take time away from someone who may need it more than myself.

Would it be weird/inconsiderate to book a second appointment a few days after my physical for the sole purpose of discussing ongoing issues, or should I just try to cram everything into one appointment, even though there would be unanswered questions?",2024-02-18T19:30:05+00:00

Healthcare,post,1at7kqn,GrabzakTurnenkov,Can I dispute or negotiate a bill after visiting a Doc. for the same thing in a week?,"TLDR: made appointment to see doc. Thought it could be strep, but Doc said no it’s something else. Gets billed $80 for the visit. Come back 5 days later with the same issue. Same doc then says we can test for strep— we do and it comes back positive. Billed for $200.
 

Back in September I was sick. As soon as I figured I was I made an appointment for Wednesday 9/6. Answered all the questions and even put out there that it feels like it could be strep, but being so early I didn’t know for sure, though it feels like it does pretty much whenever I do have it. Doc ultimately said it’s probably not strep, likely allergies or something and sent me on my way with a script for such.


Whatever he gave me didn’t help and I get a bit worse over the next day or so and make another appointment for the morning of Monday 9/11 since that was the soonest I could get in and I made sure to do it with the same doc. We go through the same process and I tell him I’m pretty sure now it’s strep.


After typing up to here I forgot to say that I took a home Covid test and it was negative. I’ve had it before and it felt nothing like this, so I was positive it wasn’t Covid.


The Doc asked me again about the Flu/Covid symptoms, to which I said no to almost all of them and that I was pretty sure it’s not, but again you never know how those change and affect people differently. He then said that we can swab/test for Strep and Flu/Covid if I want, and I suggested we do. Turns out it is strep, so Doc writes the corresponding script and I’m out.


So that right there is my issue. Visit 1 I said it feels like strep and Doc ultimately said it wasn’t and didn’t even offer the ability to test. I get charged $80 for that visit.


Visit 2, I come back 3 business days later (5 calendar days) feeling worse. I give him similar details to which he then says we can test for strep if I want, and I do.  Comes back strep positive. Get billed $200 for visit 2.


I feel it’s extremely unprofessional/unfair to have to go back a second time with the same issue before getting offered (from the same doc) the ability to test for the illness I came in for (suspecting) initially. So is there a way I can dispute this or negotiate the $200 bill? I don’t even need it to be wiped out completely— since I paid my $80 for the first visit I’d even be fine paying the difference and calling it good.


I realize after I was about to submit, based off the flairs, that I didn’t say anything about insurance. This is all after insurance (Ameriben which I think is a subset of Blue Cross Blue Shield) did it’s thing and left me with this.",2024-02-17T17:42:49+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kqxbj4z,floridianreader,,"The doctor not doing the test on the first visit was him trying to save you some money. Unfortunately it did not work out for you and you had to come back and have the test, which made it more expensive. I'll explain. (I used to work in a medical clinic that did this type of billing). 

You came in the first time for the sore throat. No test. You were billed for the basic visit charge, which was $80. 

You unfortunately got more sick and had to come back. You also had a test done. So because your case got more complicated, you were charged a ""complicated office visit"" fee which was probably in the ballpark of $120-150. Then you also had the test itself, which involved a swab of your throat, examined microscopically, and the time of the doctor or the other specialist who may have been involved with handling your test. That was probably another $50-80, making your bill a nice round $200 for that second visit. 

The doc was trying to save you the money for the test by not doing the test on visit #1. Unfortunately his crystal ball could not have foretold that your condition was going to get worse and he would still have to test you for it three days later. 

You can try to dispute the charges with the business office or the billing person at the office, but the charges seem all on the up-and-up. It sucks, but that's just how medicine works in the US.",2024-02-18T01:00:22+00:00

Healthcare,comment,kqyl3e9,GrabzakTurnenkov,,"Thanks for the detailed reply. I didn’t really look at it that way— which does make sense, but at the same the only thing different from visit 1 and 2 procedure wise was the test, so wouldn’t everything done in the $80 “basic visit” also have been in the 2nd “complicated visit?

At the same time, my biggest qualm is that the possibility of getting a test done was essentially withheld from me. Sure, it would come at an extra cost, but I would also have to agree/consent to having it done. If I declined, then at that point, needing to go back for a second time would have been my doing. But because I was never given the option, it’s on the Doc at that point, and essentially double charged for the “basic visit” but with the added fee for the test.

So would that be possible to work out? Is my thought process flawed thinking this way? I talked with some friend and family to see if they’ve had anything similar and the only suggestion I got was to contact my insurance and see if they’ll do anything or not...

I have been applying to jobs for the last month or so and have been looking for a couple months. I had 50 hour internship my last semester as a public health intern. From this, I learned that I want to work in health promotion/public health. But getting into that will be hard without a masters degree. So I have been applying to entry level or no experience jobs because that’s all I feel like I will be able to do. One of the jobs I applied for is basically working at a front desk in a doctors office through a prestigious University in my area. I currently have a part time job that pays $15/hr and currently work like 16 hours a week there. I got a call from HR at this university and got an interview with them (which is on Monday). The position is full time and great benefits but the problem is that the pay is low to me. The recruiter asked about my salary expectations and I said that I would hope to be paid $20/hr but that is negotiable. She said that the starting salary is $16.50/hr and pay is determined through experience. I have not received any job offers/Interviews since I’ve been applying. I feel that the pay is low considering I have a bachelors degree. I still live at home and have minimal bills to pay (car payment and eventually student loans). If I’m offered this job, should I take it even if it pays low? I feel like I am worth more than that but ultimately I’m young and don’t know anything but I still feel like I should be paid more than offered. Currently I’m not sure when/if I will get any calls back from other jobs I’ve applied to and am tired of being broke. But should I take it or wait? Is this a good opportunity to get my foot in the door or should I wait for something else that pays for?

The biggest thing I would say, is to really understand healthcare data elements, and be very good at pulling data out of systems, and putting it into something that you can work with the data and build out analytics products whether that would be reporting or modeling or just analyzing.

I cannot tell you how many 'healthcare analysts' who do not know the difference between allowed amount, and charges. Knowing healthcare data is the first step for anyone trying to look at the data.

For pulling data and putting it into something for reporting/modeling/analyzing, I   like to say start with whatever you comfortable with and then grow from there. I started with Excel since I knew it. And while I would argue Excel is not strong enough in today's world, it is a good place to start.

Now I pull data down directly from EHR's like EPIC through FHIR API's into my database, normalize the data, and build web and mobile applications on top of that data that I sell to providers. However, it took a little while to get to that point.

As a PC manager though, you will get more experience with LEAN practices, since the variation of services will differ from the oncology practices (you could have someone with strep, someone with a skin tag, and someone with minor pain in their abdomen all in the waiting room). 

While these are all great opportunities, I do think oncology will be the best opportunity to learn and grow... People who are good at case management/treatment plans and facilitating those are invaluable, because that is where so many practices try and save $ for the patient/practice and if you are good at it, you will positively impact the bottom line, and you will QUICKLY be promoted.

Healthcare,post,1arr45v,Ltsmba,"Does Minnesota have laws around ""Timely access to Care"" in regards to HealthCare?"," I have not been able to find anything about this online in regards to Minnesota.

My wife and I pay over $800/month for our HealthPartners insurance premiums every month. I know we are fortunate to not be paying $1k+ like many families, but even still, $800/month is a lot of money.

We have been finding more and more that getting an appointment with either a primary care physician or specialty physician has been increasing. I truly believe it has now increased to ""unacceptable"" levels.

Just recently for example, my wife attempted to make a dermatology appointment for an issue she has had for most of her life and has been seen for many times within our healthcare system. This is not a ""new"" issue for her. When calling to make an appointment she was told that the next appointment available ANYWHERE near us (aka within a reasonable distance of around 1 hour) is in NOVEMBER. 9 full months from now.

In my searches I happened to come across california's law regarding this:

[https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/healthcareincalifornia/yourhealthcarerights/timelyaccesstocare.aspx](https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/healthcareincalifornia/yourhealthcarerights/timelyaccesstocare.aspx)

Turns out if we were in California, the law says 15 business days, maximum, aka 3 weeks.  
If we were comparing what HealthPartners is stating vs Californias current law, HealthPartners is approx **12x the legal limit** of California's ""timely care law"".

Sorry for the rant... but i'm really just trying to find out... is there any recourse to this? Morally speaking, my Healthcare provider (healthpartners) should owe us a major refund on our premiums, but legally, is there anyone to contact to at least get them fined or similar?

Thanks!",2024-02-15T21:42:41+00:00
Healthcare,comment,kqlner9,PeggyAnne08,,"The short answer is, no - Minnesota doesn't have a similar provision as CA does when it comes to access to care.

There are likely a few things coming together for your wife -

\- I'm assuming that this is your wife's first time visiting dermatology with HealthPartners. So from their perspective she is a ""new patient"". New patient visits are typically longer (and are billed for differently). Not all practices are taking new patients or have physician availability for new patients -- even if the condition itself isn't new.

\- Dermatology is notorious for long wait times. It's one of the highest demand specialties with a nationwide shortage supply of doctors. It's also one of the harder specialties for new doctors to get into because of the low number of residency spots available each year for med students.

\- Availability/Access is divorced from your health plans premium. You pay a premium to your health plan will pay for (or some of) the services that you receive as long as you go to in network providers. You could pay twice what you do and still have the same outcome.

So... unfortunately there isn't much recourse. HealthPartners doesn't want there to be a 9 month waitlist to get into their clinics. There is no incentive for them to have you wait that long, in fact it's probably the opposite. But there isn't a lot they can do. Depending on the condition your wife is trying to be seen for, she could consider going in through family medicine or even urgent care. There are some things those can cover (like prescription for acne medicine).

I know it sucks. I think the time between when I requested a visit to Derm, it took me about 7 months before I was actually seen.

Editing to add - you could also consider cosmetic dermatology. These are usually folks who do have medical licenses but work in a more retail setting. Again this is condition specific, so like acne or wart removal or esthetic-related procedures could all be handled by a cosmetic dermatologist. Some of these procedures may be covered or partially covered by your health plan, or you may be able to use an HSA towards.",2024-02-15T22:26:50+00:00

Healthcare,comment,kqp90ch,HIPAA_University,,"I will say this will be pretty difficult in the hospital setting. 

Hospitals, especially in admin, do not pay what people think they do, and many of the larger ones (think AdventHealth, Kaiser) require an advanced degree for leadership positions, which are the ""6-figure"" jobs. Many people get into hospital admin because there are always jobs, pays decent, (usually) great benefits, and it's consistent with hours. 

Definitely not impossible, but without an advanced degree, you will likely settle in the 75-85k range, but the job(s) in that range are typically incredibly stable. This includes jobs in Patient Access, Rev Cycle, Patient Financial Services, Compliance, etc. 

If you want to make the most $ in the healthcare space, working at an insurance, pharmaceutical, or digital health company is the way to go. Many of the jobs are remote and if you find a ""start up"" -- even if it is just in Customer Experience/Care your career could take off. 

For digital health, think places like [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/), [Everly Health](https://www.everlyhealth.com/), or [Modern Health](https://join.modernhealth.com/mentalhealthawareness.html?qgad=665965342535&qgterm=modern%20health&gclid=CjwKCAiArLyuBhA7EiwA-qo80F7XBU8T7Uvcr-jxFUMJoJjX-u0Od8rOBVMO3n3zhxDqgNqSd1P2wBoC2JMQAvD_BwE).

There is ALWAYS hope in HC haha! There are so many jobs/orgs/companies who do health/health related things, that it's hard not to find at least something.

>How would you recommend searching for a remote job at a healthcare startup?

I am not sure of your age/experience/network size, but I would start by going through your family and close friends in healthcare and finding exactly what they do and for who. From there, reach out to the ones you think would be most willing to help, and see if they know anyone at a ""start up"" or digital HC company.

If you don't have the network to do that, I would simply just Google ""best healthcare start ups 2024"" or ""best digital health companies"" and just read up on them. If you find one you like, check their LinkedIn page to see what is posted, AND if there is a person posted as the hiring manager. If there is, try and get a message to them via LinkedIn. If it requires LI Premium, sign up for the free month and send a message.

Though, little tip about LI Premium... Get your resume updated (and have someone proof it!), narrow your search, then sign up for it. A lot of people immediately activate it then spend a week doing those first 2 things and end up not using any of the features for half the free month.

Once you have narrowed your search and have your resume updated, you should be sending out \~15-20 apps/day for at least the first 2 weeks. After that, you will see that the same ones keep popping up. I will say, I have had the most success on LinkedIn job searching, and if you feel the same, Premium is definitely worth it, especially if you're job hunting.

>And do they usually offer entry-level opportunities?

Yes, but they are usually in the customer service/experience department. That is tough work, but if you just stick to it, there are always people coming and going in the ""start up"" world, so you could get promoted relatively fast.

I know people who went from CX, answering calls about packages being lost, to Enterprise Account Manager's, working with some of the largest insurers in like 2yrs, and an EAM will likely be making close to 6-figures.",2024-02-16T16:23:29+00:00

Cleaner is obviously out. Our orderlies often transport people who are actively vomiting, and also turn up to emergencies where bleeding/vomiting etc are happening.

I guess you could work in the kitchen, but they still go round and deliver to patients. And some people's nausea is triggered by food. You'd also have to interact with patients, so you might have people with drains post surgery, or sudden bleeding, same with security. 

I guess there's stores, but that's quite competitive, especially if you only work part time. Hr usually requires experience. Administration or teleops? You'd have to be careful where administration is - I'm sure Ed admin sees body fluids all the time. Clinical records? Those jobs are usually held for years tho.  Physio assist would be lower risk, but moving people can be a trigger for vomiting, and also you have to work with people who are incontinent or might need aid in the bathroom if you're working with them away from the ward.

Messaged the chat line and was put on hold for another 30 minutes.

Patient agent first placed the blame on me saying I was late, before I clarified I wasn't. Then said there were technical difficulties on the doctors side. When I asked why the doctor or an MA hadn't just phoned me if that was the case they dodged around an answer.

Healthcare,post,1aqjwvj,MoVodka,Received vague letter that PCP left practice,"On Feb 8, I received a letter through my healthcare app stating that effective Jan 22, my PCP was no longer affiliated with the clinic, noting that anyone with an upcoming appt with said PCP would be contacted soon to reschedule their appt (I was not one of these individuals).

I was a bit bummed bc I really liked my PCP and she helped me a lot with my physical and mental health, so I started some Google searching to see if I could find out where she maybe went or transferred to. It didn’t occur to me until tonight that the letter I received was dated and sent out over a week after my PCP’s ‘effective’ departure date, leading me to wonder if this was a termination or if there was legal issues involved. 

Her biography was already removed from the hospital’s website, and I can’t even refill my prescription until I’m assigned to a new PCP. I also found it interesting that the letter noted anyone with upcoming appts with said provider will have to reschedule, rather than have these appts completed by the provider and just not schedule any new appts.

Has anyone ever experienced something like this? Is it worth trying to hunt down this PCP to transfer my care to wherever she goes, or is the verbiage in the letter likely indicating she maybe is no longer practicing at all (legal or not)? Also, could this possibly be a situation of the clinic dropping the ball and failing to notify patients in an appropriate timeframe of the doctor’s departure?",2024-02-14T10:36:27+00:00

Healthcare,comment,kqepkhc,reindeermoon,,"Every time I've had a doctor I was seeing leave their practice, it was to leave private practice entirely and do something else. For example, my amazing PCP just left to work for a concierge telemedicine service where she makes even more money and gets to work 100% at home (I asked her where she was going, and she was soooo excited). So you can try to find where your doctor went, but she may not be taking private patients anymore.

I wouldn't assume she was fired just because it was sudden, it might be that the office just wasn't on top of the administrative stuff to notify patients, or she might have just quit with minimal notice. Or it may be something legal from the other side that's not her fault, like she was sexually harassed at work or quit because of unsafe working conditions. 

So yes, go ahead and see if you can find her, but don't count on that working out. Get set up with a new PCP as soon as you can, so you will be able to get refills when you need them. You can always switch back if you are able to find your old doctor.",2024-02-14T17:08:01+00:00

You can try to track down if you want, you can also check with your insurance to see if the new practice is still in network. I've gotten those letters before but it was a doc I already didn't plan to go back to so I didnt care to follow up beyond that. Most doctors around me are booked a few months out, so I can't imagine a doctor choosing to stay for any prior bookings like that (especially because if they only have 1 that day are they going to come in special just for that? Presumably the further out you get the less patients have already booked). Very common IMO to simply be reschedule to other providers schedules",2024-02-14T16:44:55+00:00

Healthcare,post,1aqi9kn,skrait-,Pregnant in Alabama - denied for Medicaid. Medically unable to work,"My sister is 24, unmarried, living in Alabama and working at a restaurant. She was admitted to the hospital this past weekend in early labor at 22 weeks. (Dilated to 4cm, bulging sac w/small rupture) She is currently in the antepartum wing on strict bed rest and will be until she delivers. If baby survives delivery, it will be in NICU care, likely for months. Sister has been unable to work for 2 weeks at this point, and will be unable to work for the duration of her pregnancy 

My sister was denied for Medicaid and WIC when she applied in November 2023. She is a restaurant manager making about $10.16/hour. Even with tips on some shifts, she should qualify under the Medicaid income guidelines from what I can tell. 

What do we do next? She is terrified of the upcoming medical bills but will do whatever it takes to give baby a chance even if it will destroy her financially.

The issue with Alabama and most of those non-participating states is that they presume people are able and are capable of working. What we have to do is prove that she’s disabled enough to meet the guidelines. May require disability status, and that’s not gonna happen.

She should immediately file for FMLA from her job and accommodations under the pregnant workers fairness act.
