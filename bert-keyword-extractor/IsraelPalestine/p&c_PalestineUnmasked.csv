This is why anti-jew posts get a ton of upvotes and hit the front page.

Arabs and Muslims are NOT a minority! Jews are a minority! That is math!

  
It is ok for the woke to scream how whites and patriarchy are/is oppressive but it is NOT ok for us to discuss the religion of peace and how oppressive it is on women and on Jews.

PalestineUnmasked,comment,l3hrnjk,Fulmunmagik,,"To your point, even on reddit Jewish I was put on a 14 day ban because of this response to a comment: 

‚ÄúEurope allowed those who hate Westernized society through their borders and Europe is paying the price. Those refugees from Islamic countries were not able to assimilate and want Sharia law. That means LGB++ murdered, women mandated in hijabs or burkas, women stoned to death for accusations against Sharia law like adultery, woman accompanied by a male relative, everyone converting to Islam, and so much more evil. Many people on here do not seem to understand the ramification of taking in refugees that hate America, Jews, and basically anything that is not allowed within Sharia law.‚Äù

The moderators on that reddit felt I didn‚Äôt put ‚Äúthe human first‚Äù, or some shit like that. Meanwhile, my post was very tame. 
My experience with that subreddit is that it‚Äôs filled with mostly Jewish progressives who are shocked that their progressive non-Jewish friends are Pro-Hamas, and to their detriment, they would rather censor themselves then god forbid sound politically incorrect, and address a major issue that is impacting Jews. This means we are doomed as a people because the hundreds of millions of Islamists and their allies are not going to give a shit about your lives, much less our feelings.",2024-05-10T21:54:16+00:00

They don‚Äôt even like their own country because they lack so many privileges that the west has given them, yet they continue to complain and play the victim card. Muslims are NOT a minority and majority of Muslims don‚Äôt believe in peaceful coexistence. Today if UK became a majorly Muslim country, the centuries of socio-economic progress would be ruined in a second. Now there are Islamic countries that don‚Äôt follow sharia but the people in these countries don‚Äôt exercise the level of freedom that most western countries do.

Even in prison, Islam is seen to be on the rise with potential links to social indoctrination especially in the white prison community but they make up 15% (Christianity is anywhere from 30-40% depending on the source).  But really what you‚Äôd like to do is dehumanise Muslims to make what Israel is doing feel less morally reprehensible, if you‚Äôre able to denote an entire religious group as ‚Äúless than‚Äù you‚Äôre essentially praising other groups for ‚Äúclearing them up‚Äù for you.

PalestineUnmasked,comment,l3t5usf,Witty-Border-6748,,"The sheer ignorance and misinterpretation in this comment is crazy lmao. First of all, never claimed that every Muslim is a terrorist who wants to bomb me or hurt me in any sort. That is your shot at trying to downplay my entirely valid argument. Second of all, Muslims constitute 7% of the population which is about 4 million in number. The majority of this Muslims are immigrants for Afghanistan and Pakistan, these countries are falling under Islamic extremist regime. They‚Äôre own countries are doing pathetic under Islam which is why they immigrate to the UK. This is not the problem, the problem is when they try to run things THEY are according to what THEIR religion dictates. If you want proof then you can take the example of Savile town where couple of years ago protestors demanded sharia law to be implemented just because they were too sensitive to handle pork and alcohol. They are a minority but don‚Äôt act like it. They still believe in sending their children to Madrasas (over 2000 madrasas running even today in the UK) which is VERY wrong. From what history tells us, no country thrives when religious faith dominates a government. Look at Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon etc. There are sikhs and Hindus too who enjoy an even smaller minority than the Muslims but have you ever heard of them advocating for laws suiting their beliefs? And not just the UK, look at France or even Switzerland where burqas are banned. Most muslims living in these countries like to enforce their religion and it‚Äôs true, believe it or not.

# Why are the protesters calling for an end to Jewish organizations and Jewish Studies on campus?

Under Complete Academic Boycott.

Hellen Diller and Koret. These are all research organizations for Jewish studies and for fostering community for the Jewish people.

Santa Cruz Hillel is literally a Jewish community center for students on campus. I‚Äôm an UCSC alumni and attended many Shabbat services and even passover services at Hillel. It‚Äôs a safe space for Jewish voices on campus, and it‚Äôs a welcoming space. What would be the response if the demand was to shut down any other student group on campus?

If you keep insisting that Anti-Zionism is not Anti-Semitism, then why are they calling for the elimination of all organizations and programs for Jewish students on campus?""",2024-05-07T21:10:07+00:00

p -> f

b -> v

k -> kh

This is a feature Hebrew gained from Aramaic influence during the babylonian captivity, but Arabic has no such feature, which is why ""mevurakh"" in Hebrew has the Arabic cognate ""mubarak"", without b and k lenited. Normally when Arabic has loanwords, like ""Pepsi"", they substitute p with b because they don't have p, e.g. ""bibsi"". The only reason they say ""Falastin"" instead of ""Balastin"" is because it's taken from Hebrew, they don't have the mechanism to lenite p into f like Hebrew does. So both Palestine and Falestin are exonyms, they don't have an endonym at all, unless they drop the facade, in which case their endonym is just Arab or Suri (South Syrian).",2024-04-30T22:32:11+00:00

It's a weird way to phrase that question in my opinion. The survey also showed that people are very critical of Netanyahu and the government. 

You say people are ""good at disassociating an ethnicity,"" but you're blaming the majority of a country of wanting to ""commit genocide."" Like 7 million Israeli citizens wake up every morning and the first thing they think about is ""committing genocide."" Do you listen to yourself? You sound like a broken record. There's no genocide, there never was (Gaza population growth is some of the fastest in the world), and even Hamas admitted that their reported deaths were ""inaccurate,"" what a surprise ( [https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/gaza-fatality-data-has-become-completely-unreliable](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/gaza-fatality-data-has-become-completely-unreliable) ), and in addition, the combatant to civilian deaths in Gaza is some of the lowest in any urban conflict - [Israel‚Äôs war against Hamas posts lower civilian-to-combatant death ratio than other urban battles ](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/apr/18/israels-war-against-hamas-posts-lower-civilian-to-/)

Also, you want to talk surveys? ""**Almost three in four Palestinians believe the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel was correct**, and the ensuing Gaza war has lifted support for the Islamist group both there and in the West Bank, a survey from a respected Palestinian polling institute found."" ( [https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/poll-shows-palestinians-back-oct-7-attack-israel-support-hamas-rises-2023-12-14/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/poll-shows-palestinians-back-oct-7-attack-israel-support-hamas-rises-2023-12-14/) )

[A poll shows Palestinians overwhelmingly support Oct. 7.](https://jewishchronicle.timesofisrael.com/a-poll-shows-palestinians-overwhelmingly-support-oct-7-what-does-that-mean/)

In the same way, Palestinians do not see the bad side of hamas, they only see them as the only group that could achieve their liberation. This ignorance is, again, a product of their lack of access to media ( imposed by Israel through generational impoverishment and oppression.)

PalestineUnmasked,comment,l14k5be,One_Nut_Man,,"First, you‚Äôre bastardizing history. It was a group of countries in what is now the levant, including the kingdom of Israel and Judah, both ancient Jewish states, but there were also Philistines so I‚Äôll give you that. However, the Jews also have lived there since that history began as a levant people. Their temples, ruins, and countless archeological and historical records from various  ancient civilizations confirm this. It was named Syria Palaestinia only after the Roman‚Äôs conquered it as a ‚Äúscrew you‚Äù to the Jews after their rebellion, naming it after their ancient foes. Even then, they were never identified as ‚ÄúPalestinians‚Äù that‚Äôs a modern pan Arabist term coined in the 60s. 

Now to modern times, the order of rulership of the land went from the Roman‚Äôs to crusaders to Muslim Arabs to ottomans to British. So never has there been a free Palestinian state in the modern sense or otherwise. 

Today, Palestinians are in fact free. They don‚Äôt have a Palestinian State, but they are free to elect their government, rule themselves in Gaza and the West Bank, have traveled to other Muslim Arab states (and caused pure havoc) and those that are peaceful freely coexist in Israel proper. 

There‚Äôs that buzz word ‚Äúgenocide apologia‚Äù. If it‚Äôs genocide how is their population exploding, how was the Gaza Strip so scenic, and how come Israel continues to try and offer two state solutions that are shot down with acts of terrorism?

PalestineUnmasked,comment,l14qf2v,ITGOES80808,,"‚ÄúBastardizing history‚Äù ironic coming from the dude who said Palestine has never been a state lol. Buddy , Israel was not an established state until 980 BC, Judah wasn‚Äôt a state until 934 BC, Palestine (Philistina at the time) was established in 1175 BC. Not sure if you know this, but BC era goes DOWN in years, not up. Listen buddy, no one is debating whether or not Jews lived in the region, that‚Äôs a widely accepted fact by literally everyone. What I‚Äôm arguing here is that Palestinians are just as indigenous to the area as Israelis claim to be ([although 3/4ths of them have only been there for 2nd-3rd generation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis#:~:text=Among%20Jews%2C%2070.3%25%20were%20born,Africa%2C%20and%20Middle%20Eastern%20countries)). All that being said, why is it that you‚Äôre trying to discount the Palestinian right to remain home? [81-87% of Palestinians have family lineage there dating back to the BRONZE AGE!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_the_Palestinians#:~:text=Palestinians%2C%20among%20other%20Levantine%20groups,10%25%20from%20Bronze%20age%20Europeans) How can you make arguments these foolish when history and empirical data easily debunk you? 

‚ÄúNever has there been a free Palestinian state in the modern state or otherwise,‚Äù okay, so using this argument you agree that Palestinians ARE NOT free, correct? You‚Äôve spent this whole argument saying they are. Sticking with this, because Palestine has been colonized/imperialized/occupied for its entire history, it‚Äôs okay for Israel to do it? Once again, sounds like genocide apologia, ‚Äúeveryone else killed and occupied these people, why can‚Äôt we do it too?‚Äù

Dude, the Palestinians clearly aren‚Äôt fucking free if they don‚Äôt even have access to agriculture and travel/commerce without Israeli approvalüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Also, they‚Äôre ‚Äúfree to rule themselves,‚Äù but I they‚Äôre also ‚Äúnot a state.‚Äù How does that work? üòÇüòÇüòÇ

‚ÄúIf is a genocide how is their population exploding‚Äù it‚Äôs funny you mention that, because genocide deniers said the EXACT SAME THING during the [RWANDAN GENOCIDE.](https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno1-3-04.htm) ‚ÄúHow was the Gaza Strip so scenic‚Äù probably because it wasn‚Äôt the frontline for a war until Israel bombed it. Ironic that you bring up a two-state solution since that‚Äôs what [the majority of Palestinians want and have wanted for decades.](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna144183) I find it funny that you guys treat Hamas like it‚Äôs some boogeyman, the only reason it exists is because of Israeli occupation. It‚Äôs like the American government being mad about ISIS when they‚Äôre the ones who created them. üòÇüòÇüòÇ",2024-04-25T00:43:13+00:00
PalestineUnmasked,comment,l14tgkg,One_Nut_Man,,"First, I know how BC works. Jews were still in the region as nomadic Semitic tribes just as the Philistines were. They were ‚ÄúPalestinians‚Äù they were either Canaanites or Philistines. We agree both ancestors of modern groups have been there as far back as memory and records exist.  

Arab Muslims as an identity didn‚Äôt begin until the 700s when‚Äôs Arabism and Muslims flooded out during the emergence of the caliphate. Palestinian Muslims as a group thus begin then, before then they were either Jewish, Greek, Roman, or any mix of cultures that had conquered the region by that period. 

The Palestinian identity as known today originated in the 60s thanks to the Pan-Arab movement, which was a Arab Muslim movement to establish a neo-Muslim state. 

I‚Äôm not arguing against Palestinians living in coexistence with Jews in a two state solution, you can check every comment on the thread. I call out how Palestinians live in Israel with complete freedom. You can live freely, and have self governance, as Gazans did until hamas came into power or as the West Bank and PLA. They are free, israel has no governance over them. They also get billions in aid and are able to travel in and out of the regions. I wonder why hamas hasn‚Äôt better invested that aid towards infrastructure or building up the strip? Or why they haven‚Äôt tried to find a compromise with Israel like similar to the Greeks and Turks in Cyprus or the Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland? Could it possibly be due to being blinded by ideology? An ideology which even other Arab states are becoming lukewarm towards as more radical Palestinians destabilize their states when seeking asylum?

Finally, idk why you shared the link to the history of the Rwandan genocide. It lasted several months, and was a brutal, calculated act of extermination. I don‚Äôt see any equal comparison to Hamas and Palestinians waging constant terror attacks and being responded to with force, nor how they continue to explode in population size under 70+ years of ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù. 

Gaza was scenic until the war started, I‚Äôm glad you agree. Too bad hamas didn‚Äôt invest in making it a safe place for people, didn‚Äôt tolerate anything besides radical Islam, attacked their neighbor to prompt a military response, or tried to find a peace with Israel. At what point is it on hamas to take responsibility for their own destruction?

The fact that you think the US created ISIS and not a multitude of complex factors shows me that you‚Äôre just a moron and this is a waste of efforts to even try to discuss with you.",2024-04-25T01:02:33+00:00
PalestineUnmasked,comment,l14zedl,ITGOES80808,,"1.) okay, so you agree both Palestinians and Jews have a right to live in the region then, correct? Great, glad you agree. That being said, both groups should be able to have a two-state solution that is fair and equal to all groups. The occupation of the others territory should be out of the question, i.e.) Palestine should be free from Israeli interference and should have its land restored. 

2.) the semantics of ‚Äúactually they weren‚Äôt called Palestinians until this date, and they weren‚Äôt referred to as this until this date‚Äù aren‚Äôt important, what‚Äôs important is that we understand that the Palestinian people, as we know them today, have an origin dating back before the existence of Israel and Palestine itself, the issue of ‚Äúthe never had a real state‚Äù is irrelevant to their existence. These people exist, historically they‚Äôve existed longer than the ‚ÄúIsraeli‚Äù people (not Jewish people, Israel as in the nation) have existed, and that shouldn‚Äôt be negated or overlooked. 

3.) ‚ÄúPalestinians live in Israel with complete freedom‚Äù they don‚Äôt, though, Palestinians have [numerous restrictions on movement and daily activities in Israel.](https://www.btselem.org/topic/freedom_of_movement#) ‚ÄúThey are free, Israel has no governance over them‚Äù YES. THEY. DO. THEY LITERALLY CONTROL THEIR ABILITY TO TRAVEL IN AND OUT OF PALESTINE üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Funny that you keep bringing up Hamas‚Äô poor leadership, considering the majority of Palestinians DISAPPROVE of Hamas. What‚Äôs even funnier is that you justify Israel‚Äôs abysmal actions by saying ‚Äúbut Hamas does this too!‚Äù Like yeah, Hamas is bad and doesn‚Äôt take proper care of Palestine, how does that justify Israel‚Äôs oppression and ongoing genocide? Do two wrongs make a right? 

4.) ‚ÄúIdk why you shared the link to the history of the Rwandan Genocide‚Äù I literally explained it in the very same sentence that the link was in, buddy, but I‚Äôll explain it again. You said ‚Äúif there is a genocide why is the population exploding‚Äù which, like I said, WAS A PHRASE USED BY GENOCIDE DENIERS DURING THE RWANDAN GENOCIDE. Let me break something down for you, a genocide can occur why population grows. Genocide is a systemic mass murder of members of a nation/ethnic/religious/politcal group for the purpose of eradicating and destroying that group(s). Israel is killing Palestinians IN MASS, and for that matter, MOSTLY CIVILIANS. If the roles were reversed, and Palestine had killed 13,000 Israeli children I‚Äôd be just as mad. I understand you view this matter with rose-tinted glasses, but you need to understand that this war is much more complicated than you think it is. 

5.) No one is negating Hamas‚Äôs poor leadership or saying they aren‚Äôt responsible for any issues facing Palestine. As I‚Äôve argued, though, Israel‚Äôs long-time occupation and current genocide of Palestinians isn‚Äôt exactly making city-planning a hot number. 

6.) The fact that [you couldn‚Äôt even do research or a simple google search on this matter shows me you‚Äôre an even bigger moron and that I‚Äôm wasting my time discussing this with you.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/11/isis-origins-anbari-zarqawi/577030/#) This whole debate goes to show that the average Israeli supporter argument is backed by personal feelings and minimal facts.",2024-04-25T01:40:29+00:00

Are we going to ignore that the ICJ has declared that there are grounds to investigate further into the Israel genocide? Are we going to ignore the UN ceasefire resolution calling for Israel to stop blocking food and supplies from entering Gaza and effectively using the lack of food and medicine and supplies as a weapon against the general population? Are we going to ignore the 100+ dead journalists and doctors?  Are we also going to ignore that Israel tortured and coerced UNRWA workers to lie that the UNRWA was helping hamas on October 7th, thus resulting in a UN owned humanitarian organisation being refunded by governments across the globe thus resulting in not just aid being lessened in gaza, but to all countries that need aid across the world?

All of this is publicly available on social media and on articles but most importantly in government's and institutions' publicly available legislation, resolutions, statistics and articles.

To expose the lies and hypocrisy of radical Pro-Palestinian groups is not an easy feat, Especially with the fact that most people assume Palestinians can only be victims and never the aggressors.


But we want to make a few important clarifications regarding the sub:

1. This sub is dedicated to exposing the hypocrisy and lies of Palestinians and Pro-Palestinian groups. This sub is not for demonizing Palestinians and not for joking or meming on the Palestinians.

2. Posting posts from subs like r/Palestine and other similar subs without any relevant context will get your post removed. It will seem as if you are trying to brigade the sub with those posts rather than point out a lie or a propaganda post.

3. Please understand there is a line between ranting about Palestinians and their supporters, and exposing them. Don't use this sub as a daily rant sub, if there is a demend we will open a weekly discussion post for you to discuss and express your opinions and emotions.



On another note, we would like to announce that we are looking for new mods and people who can help this sub in other ways. 

With the help of more mods, we'll be more able to stop the brigade of Hamas supporters and make the sub organized and maintained.

We also want to come up with a clear set of rules, a sub logo, and a better description for the sub.


We would love to hear your opinions or concerns for us to improve.

When it came to what Reddit termed ‚Äúlegally grey‚Äù areas surrounding CSAM, Reddit initially dealt with them on a ‚Äúcase by case basis.‚Äù But eventually Reddit took more sweeping action to curb CSAM on its platform. For example, Reddit administrators banned the controversial community r/jailbait after a nude picture of a 14-year-old girl was posted on the subreddit.   
By 2012, Reddit had reformed its content policy: All subreddits that focused on the sexualization of children were banned. But in 2014, The Washington Post suggested little had substantively changed, with ‚Äúevery kind of filth and depravity you can conceive of‚Äîand probably quite a bit that you can‚Äôt‚Äù still live on the site.

Here is what you are trying to ignore. 

there are 10 million jews; that's an actual ""minority"" group.

The reason they call themselves palestinians in Gaza is so they don't have to call themselves Arab. Because everyone knows that Arabs are 500 million strong, they are Arabs in Egypt, they are Arabs in Jordan, and then the question becomes why is Egypt building a wall to keep out the Arabs of Gaza and why does Jordan mistreat them so much if they are all the same people?

This is the same reason why your woke and Islamic friends don't care about China running **uyghur concentration camps.** Because your woke and Islamic friends are ok with China abusing innocent Muslims, but they are NOT OK with Jews defending themselves after children and women were raped and murdered.

Do you understand the difference now?   


I'm glad you are concerned about the Arabs/Muslims of Gaza, I am too. But I am also concerned about the Muslims of China, but you're not. Your woke friends are not. Your Islamic friends are not. There is NO ONE coming to the defense of the uyghur in Chinese concentration camps, because there are no Jews to blame.

Jews through out history have been the scape goats for everything under the sun. Now you are part of the group that are scapegoating them.

&#x200B;

On October 7th, hundreds of women and children were raped and murdered by Hamas. Everything that came after October 7th is to ensure that this never happens again. 

Even today Hamas still doesn't want a cease fire; all while UN is screaming and pretending that it's the Jews who don't want a cease fire.

Saying ""Palestinians"" are not a ""minority group"" of people is NOT ""dehumanizing.""

Dehumanizing is what Arabs and Muslims and woke liberals, do and say about Jews; that's dehumanizing.

Nobody likes war and the death and destruction it brings ‚Ä¶.. BUT

How dare you celebrate that atrocity..
How dare you celebrate the innocent slaughter, rape, torture and maiming of humans (doesn‚Äôt matter if they were elderly adults adolescents children or babies) 
You don‚Äôt celebrate death like that. 

Then you become the victim‚Ä¶ oh woe is me look what they are doing 
WELL THEN DONT POKE THE BEAR. 

You deserve all the destruction that is raining down on you. 
It‚Äôs sad but WAR brings death and innocent people get hurt‚Ä¶.

The 1000‚Äôs of miles of death tunnels built.. what are they for 
Don‚Äôt be naive. The billions in charitable donations went to building a clan descent terror war machine. So sophisticated and robust that new pieces of their puzzle are being discovered every day!!
That infrastructure built close to ‚Äúinnocents‚Äù, those tunnels built for miles and miles‚Ä¶.
That was by design, not by mistake. 

WAR IS WAR PEOPLE‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs ugly!!

Yes it will take a while for Israel to recover from the propaganda and lies that have been spinning out of the Hamas communication machine.

PalestineUnmasked,post,1azz6mq,fewatifer,Urgent: Sign the UN WATCH petition to replace UNRWA!,"





Urgent: please sign the UN WATCH petition to replace UNRWA at https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/replace-unrwa/

And when you are done, go over to the UN WATCH site and sign these other important petitions: https://unwatch.org/take-action/

UN WATCH does incredible and tireless work and the least we can do is sign a petition. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Here is the text of the petition about replacing UNRWA:

Enough is enough. UNRWA must be dissolved and replaced.

In the last few weeks, it has been revealed that:

12 UNRWA staff took part in the October 7th massacre
1,200 UNRWA staff in Gaza are members of terrorist groups
3,000 UNRWA teachers were in a Telegram group that celebrated October 7th
Hamas built a terror tunnel directly below UNRWA Headquarters in Gaza, hiding a computer intelligence center that was powered by the agency‚Äôs electrical grid
The UN and its secretary-general Antonio Guterres cannot pretend they are ‚Äúhorrified‚Äù by this news.

Because for the last decade, UN Watch sent them countless warnings about UNRWA staff support for terrorism. The UN did nothing, except to attack the messenger.

That terrorism would find a haven in UNRWA is no surprise. The entire purpose of the agency is to perpetuate grievance, hatred, and war, by refusing to resettle Arab refugees from 1948 and their descendants.

Today, UNRWA absurdly deems 70% of Gaza‚Äôs population ‚Äî who live in what they call Palestine ‚Äî as ‚Äúrefugees.‚Äù

Since its creation in 1949, the agency has brainwashed Gazans into believing that their home is not Gaza, but rather on the other side of the fence, in Israel.

There is a direct line between this narrative, part of a radicalization process that took place over many years in UNRWA schools, and the invasion of Israel by thousands of Gazan terrorists breaking through the fence and massacring Israeli civilians on October 7th. For Hamas, they were merely exercising their UNRWA-promoted ‚Äúright of return.‚Äù  

The lie that UNRWA‚Äôs humanitarian work is ‚Äúirreplaceable‚Äù is now being used to further entrench the agency‚Äôs poisonous ideology of Palestinian ‚Äúreturn‚Äù to Israel.

Don‚Äôt let your government continue spending your money on the radicalization of Gaza. Humanitarian aid and UNRWA‚Äôs toxic mandate must be immediately decoupled.

Aid should flow through other agencies which already operate in Gaza, and which are experts at this task everywhere else in the world, such as the WHO, the World Food Programme, or UNICEF.

Enough is enough. It‚Äôs time to stop the perverse logic of an agency that perpetuates war. It‚Äôs time to replace UNRWA.

1. I'm not Muslim, or a jihadi and those two things do not go hand in hand. In fact I don't agree with any religion, so don't make assumptions. I respect people of all faiths and there's a clear line between Jews and Zionism mate just like there is a fine line between Islam and Jihadists. 

The abrahamic religions have all spread hate one way or another throughout history E.g. Christianity and the crusades. 

2. If you actually studied other religions or utilised Google, a free resource in 2024, you would know and understand that most abrahamic religions are not built on violence. Islam preaches peace and patience. 

The violence you base your assumptions on Islam are radical groups who ruin the image of the religion like we see in Catholicism with pedophile clergymen or the Westboro Baptist church and their treatment of people of colour, LGBTQ+ communities and women seeking healthcare or abortions OR the Jews and Zionists - completely separate groups and ideologies. 

3. Is your evidence based on fact or feelings? I'm upset over the treatment of Palestinians based on factual reporting from reputable news outlets and journalists. You're allowed to feel however you'd like, but you can't simply state that the information you have is true because of how you feel. 

Countless Muslim and Jewish faith groups and communities are coming together to protest against the ""war"". Historically, the Jews and Muslims in the middle east lived together harmoniously, here are some reputable sources:

""Jews at the time of Muhammad and the rise of Islam had a long history in Arabia and were well integrated into both urban and rural environments as urban craftsmen, traders, farmers, and bedouin.""

The Jews of Arabia at the Birth of Islam(pp. 39-57)

""The Islamic world housed the majority of the world‚Äôs Jews for most of the medieval period, and the Jewish communities of the Islamic world were responsible for many of the institutions, texts, and practices that would define Judaism well into the modern era. Islamic rule remade the very conditions‚Äîintellectual, demographic, economic‚Äîin which Jewish communities lived, and created a civilization that enabled them to thrive""

There are countless reports of pissrael forces committing numerous war crimes e.g. dressing up as civilians and storming a hospital, destroying hospitals, universities and other important infrastructure, targeting journalists, crushing people with tanks and the list goes on and on. It's a disgrace.

Yes, it's horrible what happened on October 7th but don't you think after 75 years of an open air prison that they would eventually revolt? Are you not aware of what the IOF are currently doing to hostages too? Rape, torture, humiliation and posting it all online for fun. Don't you think that's disgusting? How can you defend this behaviour?

I've watched almost every video of Israel/Palestine for the last 10 years, including the 7th October massacres. But these videos were difficult to watch for me. 

Adults and teachers brainwashing little children, telling them that Jews are the source of all problems, preaching that they will conquer the entirety of Israel, inciting violence by encouraging them to kill Jews. Singing songs about conquering the whole land, practicing school plays about kidnapping Israelis. Worst of all, the adults feel absolutely no remorse encouraging the kids to sacrifice their lives for the cause.

Moreover, just because someone was a Jew in the eyes of the Nazis doesn't mean that they saw themselves that way unlike in Gaza where Hamas has no regard for the human rights and suffering of Gazans almost all of whom are Muslim like themselves and from the same tiny region. Also, you can learn more about kapos from the Stanford prison experiment. In addition, by calling Hamas the kapos then who are the Nazis? Obviously this just fuels the narrative that Zionists are Nazi's. Holocaust denial is rampant and the lack of education is apparent from misguided comments like yours. Please try to shut down these comparisons and not add to them.

PalestineUnmasked,comment,kghktm9,FearlessZone2,,"The terrorists who started a war on Oct. 7, according to Palestinian Authority law, will be compensated financially for a massacre well done. The same PA that President Biden wants to run postwar Gaza will reward the murderers‚Äô families with grants followed by monthly stipends for life. That means taxpayers from the U.S. and Europe will help pick up the tab.  
  
The Palestinian postal service [said](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=751871243654431&set=a.295993912575502&type=3&locale=ar_AR&paipv=0&eav=AfbTOnPUemJai6QuWliNJyAMC6Sc2755wu4zLlXGuva1zJZBggVw5JtxIJmDe6gqSz4&_rdr) at the end of the year that ‚Äúmartyrs, wounded and prisoners‚Äù‚ÄîPalestinian terrorists or their families, in other words‚Äîwill receive their November stipends starting this past Saturday via the Palestine Post Bank. The PA is in a fiscal crunch, so this time payments will be at a reduced rate of 65%, plus 14% of the money that the martyrs & co. are owed from past deductions.  
  
The money is paid out in the PA-run West Bank as well as Hamas-run Gaza, often with a lag. Before the Oct. 7 terrorists can be rewarded, their families must submit paperwork for proof of martyrdom and power of attorney to open a bank account. But unless something changes, a salary will be sent to reward the family of the terrorist who was recorded calling home on Oct. 7 to tell his mother, ‚ÄúI killed 10 Jews with my own hands!‚Äù  
  
So we have that to look forward to. For now, the PA keeps paying the established terrorists, unmoved by Mr. Biden‚Äôs combination of U.S. pressure and endorsement. According to Itamar Marcus of Palestinian Media Watch, ‚Äúmartyr families‚Äù typically receive 1,400 shekels (almost $400) a month for life. Salaries for terrorist prisoners rise over time from 1,400 shekels to 12,000 shekels ($3,300) a month.  
  
This ‚Äúpay-for-slay‚Äù program costs more than $300 million a year, about 8% of the PA budget. Mr. Marcus also [shows](https://palwatch.org/page/34891)  that 65% is the same rate at which the PA is paying civil servants. Apparently, compensating terrorists is no less a priority than staffing the government. The PA may judge both essential in keeping the streets at bay as President Mahmoud Abbas begins the 20th year of his four-year term in office.  
  
Treated by the West as the ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù Palestinians, the PA is showered with aid, including much of the more than $700 million a year the European Union sends to the Palestinians. President Trump stripped more than $200 million in aid in 2018, but Mr. Biden restored it in 2021 and has since sent more. Aid dollars free up the PA‚Äôs own money to pay terrorists.  
  
The West forgets that moderation is relative. Leaders of the PA‚Äôs dominant Fatah faction have praised the Oct. 7 massacre, while its military wing claims to have taken part.  
  
Israel, which collects tax revenue for the PA, is currently withholding the 30% of it that the PA sends to Hamas-run Gaza. Mr. Abbas has refused to accept the remainder, and Mr. Biden is unhappy about the impasse. Axios reported last week that the disagreement led to ‚Äúone of the most difficult and ‚Äòfrustrating‚Äô conversations Biden has had with Netanyahu.‚Äù  
  
Mr. Biden insists that Israel hand over Gaza after the war to the PA, which he promises will be ‚Äúrevitalized.‚Äù But the money the U.S. funnels still ends up subsidizing terrorism. Perhaps the President should redirect his frustration to the Palestinian Authority.",2024-01-05T20:59:04+00:00

She only mentioned Israel by mistake because she had a mask off moment for her hatred of Jews and said the President of Ukraine is Israeli Jewish before correcting herself and just saying because he is Jewish. 

I am not Jewish or religious, but through all the books I have read, the conflict really boils down to Muslims hating Jews. They thought when the British left they would just steam roll the Jews and be able to genocide them. So they immediately tried to do that, but they lost. Then they tried to do it again, and they lost again. Then they kept trying and kept losing. After Israel caught on that they would never stop trying to destroy them, they took measures to protect themselves. The measures the Jews took to protect themselves are now in some peoples view a genocide, oppression, or an open air prison to the side that kept trying to genocide and oppress the Jews.

I lost all sympathy for the Palestinians, as have many Arab countries that originally supported them. If my neighbor constantly attacked me in my home, shot rockets at my house to try to kill my family, and occasionally crossed into my land and killed my family, I would certainly build a really high and secure fence to keep them out and make sure they could no longer get rockets to shoot at my house. 

This is such a damning interview into the mind of certain Palestinians that have their opinions strictly fueled by Antisemitism and it should be so easy to condemn as wrong, yet some people can‚Äôt condemn blatant Antisemitism when it is as clear as day.

PalestineUnmasked,comment,kcmb0tn,None,,"Arab expulsion of Jews did happen as a response of the news of the Nakba and zionism , but there's more to this. 

Did you fools know that at most it was mass Jewish immigration? And did you also know that many Jews wanted to remain in the Middle Eastern nations? They were pressurised by the israeli government.. For example in Morocco? 

 So much so that a series synagogue in Iraq was almost bombed by [mossad ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950%E2%80%931951_Baghdad_bombings)
This happened to convince the Jews that it's unsafe there.

Another brutal and messed up thing was the [Yemenite Children Affair ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemenite_Children_Affair), basically... israel kidnapped Yemenite Kids, told their parents they died but gave them to rich European settlers.

Another big reason as to why Jews are forbidden to take a DNA test.

Speaking of of.. Here's some historical facts after which I'll go to my conclusion 

1)And also.. Ask yourself.. Why did so many Jews live in this Middle Eastern nations? I thought all Arabs and Muslims were barbarians and very Anti-semetic.. Isn't it obvious? You were lied to.. I read an article about this issue and the author repeatedly said the reasons were because of nationalism.. Which is obviously false because israeli historians disagrees, hence everything up top.. The article was given to me by a pro-israeli.. It was a zionist website and had no source that was cited. Hence the lies.. Why lie about this? Hmm?

2)Anyway, the reason so many Jews were there was because they were fine, and some were previously expunged by Europe for their Anti-semetism and finally taken in by the Ottomans. Or they have lived there ever since Islam's spread.. Morocco for example, many Jews were in Al-Andalusia, but when the Muslims returned their Jizziyah tax to the Jews as they were leaving.. The Jews didn't want to live there and instead immigrated with them back to Morocco.

3)Again.. Why do you never hear about this as israelis? I thought Jewish history was important.. How come you don't know the Jew's time spent with Muslims in their golden age was also labelled as the ""Jewish golden age"" for Jews?

This 2 sections were to prove that israelis have no historical knowledge and the reason is because of their dehumanisation of Muslims and Arabs which they don't want to admit and their hypocrisy of having said knowledge. Another reason, we know how israel twists their stories around right? Well this ""Arabs were nationalists"" is one of them.


Anyway, this is not a trump card for zionists and I'll tell you why.. Zionism, with it's racism aside.. Is the belief of a nation for all those who claims to be Jews.

So, this ""ethnic cleansing"" should not be something you ideologically complain about about because this is what zionism is and what it wanted . Your status quo was met, this is why many Jews were terrorised or at the least pressured to go back.
Because you wanted it, and zionism doesn't care about how it gets the Jews to comply as long as it's effective.. You heard it ""effective"", this is how the israeli government functions. This gives the Baghdad terrorist attacks a darker shade.. They were terrorising them to get fulfill what zionism wants.. No matter how twisted.

In conclusion, this all happened because of zionism, Jews were never hated until you showed up, you wanted zionism to be Judaism and it worked.. But it's side effects were people fell for it and mixed up the 2.. Hence even more persucation from the Arabs because you made them see the Jews as ""bloodthirsty murderers"".. And when they were left alone.. You pressured them to leave.. If that didn't work you terrorised them or kidnapped their offsprings in the hopes to make them think they are unsafe.

You stole land and wanted people to go there by any means possible and to make it even more effective, you ignore and change history and brainwash your civilians with the lies, which dehumanises them

So.. Remember.. There's nothing more Anti-semetic or racist that zionism",2023-12-09T10:57:50+00:00
PalestineUnmasked,comment,kcllj0x,Turbulent_Public_i,,"Here is the thing. Nakba isn't fake, dir yassin isnt fake history, tantura isn't fake history, israel taking more land than was designated by the UN isn't fake history, Trump helping Israel annex the westbank isn't inaccurate history. Those events happened and those events are filmed with color cameras, with Israeli witnesses telling the stories. This isn't an education problem. The children in gaza for 17 years had to listen to the loud buzzing sound of the unmanned israeli drone 24/7 that would only stop when Israel was planning an air strike. That's not an education issue, they just had to look up in the sky and see it. 

You can't round up a huge amount of people in a box. 

Pick half of them, treat them as sub human and let them exist among you, pick even a fewer number of them to tokenize their existence, and then boast about how good of a person you are.

Go learn about the conditions of those non Jewish Arabs, get educated about Nakba and right to return. Go learn about the early zionist project that lead to all the arab jews to leave to Israel, Then come and accuse others of being uneducated.

Palestinians are not taught lies, they were taught about Nakba which is historically accurate, and even Israel doesn't refute it, they just defend their actions by using religious texts like ISIS fanatics, they didn't even need to be taught, they saw the annexation of the West Bank in 2020/2021, they lived through covid when they had to smuggle the vaccine, they witnessed their own airport get demolished, they saw their friends from school get apprehended, 12 year olds going to prison like fully grown adults, they saw Shreen Abu Akleh get sniped and then saw israel admit it and get no repercussions,  they saw tanks in residential neighborhoods. You can't just throw numbers around and then blabber about how it's not ethnic cleansing because it's not as successful as you want it, because people resisted you.

Most of the Israeli land is not accessible to Palestinians, the natural gas fields on their shoreline is not accessible, they can't leave their own beach, and they can't just simply go to other countries without your approval. They can't import things without you watching them and controlling how much they can get. 

Non Jewish Arabs in the west bank cannot leave their homes and just simply return, if they exit to gaza they have to sign that they're ""voluntarily"" never coming back. Armed settlers go unchecked in the West Bank. Palestinians don't need education to tell them this, they live through them.",2023-12-09T05:22:27+00:00

Yemeni-born Yisrael Yeshayahu, former Knesset speaker, Labor Party, stated: ""We are not refugees. [Some of us] came to this country before the state was born. We had messianic aspirations.""

 Iraqi-born Shlomo Hillel, also a former speaker of the Knesset, Labor Party, claimed: ""I do not regard the departure of Jews from Arab lands as that of refugees. They came here because they wanted to, as Zionists.""

Historian Tom Segev stated: ""Deciding to emigrate to Israel was often a very personal decision. It was based on the particular circumstances of the individual's life. They were not all poor, or 'dwellers in dark caves and smoking pits'. Nor were they always subject to persecution, repression or discrimination in their native lands. They emigrated for a variety of reasons, depending on the country, the time, the community, and the person.""

Can you point at what isn't a fact here?

I will never deny the current nationality of the Palestinians as I still hope for a solution to this never ending conflict together with the hope of seeing a peaceful Palestinian country in the WB. However, using lies and twisted facts isn't going to bring us to this milestone. 

For example - acknowledging the roots of the Palestinians is important - they are a diverse group of Arabs who settled in a land ruled by so many different empires that used to be called Palestina, a name based on an ethnic group that is gone for thousands of years and has nothing to do with the current Palestinians, most of them were brought in from other Arab nations to be workers. That said, they still deserve to be govern properly. Most of the WB is settled by Palestinians who are not wanted anywhere they go. They deserve to live peacefully like anyone else, but they have to get control over the terror groups and their violent culture (yes, going to Israel to kill Jew civilians, then celebrate with candies each time is a violent culture).

Through the years I met a few WB Palestinians (before the current war), and they were kind, gentle and peaceful. They also spoke ill of the culture in the WB (especially the culture towards gays) and even called me out on not living in reality when I said peace is achievable. 

Before you say anything about Israel's actions in the WB - I preach for the same thing. Denying the deeds of our government and the violent settlers and acting as if Israel is completely innocent isn't going to get us to a two-state solution. Our current government is the worst government to ever exist in Israel - a bunch made of moronic radical right wingers, messianic lunatics, ultra orthodox who basically extort the rest of the country, and a wannabe makyavelist dictator loser and liar with no backbone as a PM.

Israelis blame the continuous settling in the WB for the war for many reasons. Israelis want to see Bibi **go** (preferably to prison for the rest of his life), and want the illegal building in the WB to cease.

Hopefully things are going to change drastically in the next few years when we'll finally switch government and in a hope to see most of this government sent to prison for crimes against Israel, against the Israeli people, and against innocent Palestinians.",2023-12-22T19:14:36+00:00

Just like Arabs have settled here back then, so did the Jews. Just like there were Arabs who lived here with no government or any clear system in place, so did Jews. 

>israelis expel 700000 palestinians 2 days BEFORE the arab israeli war

Can you provide citations please? I have no idea what you are referring to, and I need to read about it. From speaking to pro-Palestinians in the past I learned things aren't always as they seem at first, but sometimes they do.

>how did various riots between arabs and jews happened due to jewish immigration in the 20s and 30s?

Both are to be blamed. Don't forget Arabs massacred Jews in Hebron in 1929, and it was just one case of Arab violence against Jews at the time. Do you have any incidents of Jews massacring Arabs before 1948? As I said, I am harsh on both sides when it comes to this kind of violence.

>if you engage in nakba denial here, i would consider you as bad as a nazi

The Nakba was real, and Israel likes to cover it up. They don't teach us ""that part"" of our history, and it sickening. Not acknowledging past crimes is what brought us here, and I am referring both to Israel and the Palestinians. I myself keep raising awareness about the Nakba to anyone who's willing to listen. Go watch Tantura (2022). 

However, times were different back then for Israel, it was just after the Holocaust ended, and all Arab nations chose to attack a day old country with basically nothing. No way to control its soldiers affectively , and there was a lot of rage against Arabs back then. The antisemitism from Arabs countries against the Jews was dangerous and scary, it still is to this day.

The horrors against the Palestinians should be acknowledged on our part, but also the horrors done and keep being done by Palestinians and the rest of the Arab nations against Israel.

Stop pretending to be human, you also use the word Zionists as if it is an evil ideology. Zionism stands for the ideology that the Jewish people deserve a state of their own in their homeland, Israel.

While it is well-documented that the Arab population from Arabia in the area (nowadays called Palestinians) has been persecuting Jews, slaughtering them, and dehumanizing them for centuries.
