Netanyahu's Israel is doing to the Palestinians, the same things in plain sight, and there is no government except Spain and Ireland protesting.

 It is time to give the Palestinians their sovereignty. Let them have their own government. Rule them selves, protect them selves since no one is. They have been paying the price that they didn't do. Their lands were taken from them and given to people who lived more than 2000 years in there because no one wanted them. They don't want the Palestinians there.

Netanyaho, read the old testaments again. It was God who expelled you from those lands. 

Netanyahu sounds like a damage record, saying the palestinias killed almost 1300 of Israelis every time they speak. They play the victims. Yes, everyone, even in the most remote places on earth, heared it.  Life is precious no matter who's it is. The Israelis have been killing, aresting, and imprisoning thousands of Palestinians for decades. Treating them less than subhuman.
Less than 1300 vs. more than 40,000 and rising. Is there a comparison.  Not to mention the ones they long killed before Oct 7th.?
There is no way Israeli intelligence didn't know what was going to happen.  Egyptian intelligence informed  the Israelis of a plat. Netanyaho intelligence should be investigated. 
Netanyahu is benefiting for the October 7th attack.  He is staying in power, avoiding prosecutions of his coruption charges, and extermination an entire ethnic group off the face of the earth, so they can anexed what little was left to them.
Him and his ultra right miniums should be tried for crimes against humanity.  
It seems to me that Israel should have taken the Oct 7th and responded more as police or military tactical action instead of a full military assault. Hamas never was a match to Israel military supremacy. 
Shame to those politicians using Israel as a political score, be it Republicans and some Democrats.
Israel doesn't need more weapons. They have enough to kill every Palestinians at least twice. 
Give those weapons to Ukraine.  They are the ones fighting a real imperial terrorist state, Russia's ""ras-putin."" 
rus-putin & Netanyahu they both should be tried in the Hague, side by side.
You are not only going to be responsible for the 40,000,  50,000, 60,000 killed by your weapons, but also many thousands more will die of hunger and diseases.",2024-05-12T12:00:16+00:00

israelexposed,post,1cpkndc,oneoftheroadstorome,Israel is subjecting the world to narcissistic abuse,"The rhetoric cascade used by Israel for any given action facing condemnation has been shared in this community before, and to those familiar with The Narcissist‚Äôs Prayer, I‚Äôm sure it has felt familiar. I‚Äôve taken the liberty of rewriting the rhetoric to fit the format of The Narcissist‚Äôs Prayer and, well‚Ä¶

¬†

The Israeli Prayer:

Hamas did it.

And if they didn‚Äôt, they made us do it.

And if they didn‚Äôt, it wasn‚Äôt that bad.

And if it was, it was justified.

And if it wasn‚Äôt, Hamas is still worse.

And if they‚Äôre not, you‚Äôre anti-Semitic.

¬†

The Narcissist‚Äôs Prayer:

That didn't happen.

And if it did, it wasn't that bad.

And if it was, that's not a big deal.

And if it is, that's not my fault.

And if it was, I didn't mean it.

And if I did, you deserved it.

¬†

But the narcissistic parallels runs deeper than that.

Narcissists tend to portray themselves as the good guy, vilify the object of their abuse and portray themselves as the victim of the abused person.

Israel paints themselves as the only country in the Middle East upholding Western, democratic values, claims that Gazans support and protect Hamas and that their ultimate goal is to kill Israelis and destroy Israel. ¬†

To successfully recruit people who can aid in the abuse, narcissists need to control the narrative surrounding themselves and their victim. Through lying, manipulation and triangulation, narcissists can recruit flying monkeys, who accept the narrative presented to them and who will volunteer to partake in the manipulation and abuse of the victim. These people are usually motivated by their own desires. Narcissists also usually have enablers who tend to have a close relationship with the narcissist, show unconditional support and make it easier for the abuse to take place. These people can be driven by hope, fear, or admiration.

To control the narrative, Israel has lobby organizations primarily acting in the US and the EU. These organizations influence politicians to enact legislature that supports the Israeli narrative and Israel as a country (anti-BDS laws, entangling the definition of anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism and criticism of the Israeli government, and approving increased military aid to Israel). Israel also has organizations such as NGO Monitor and UN Watch, entirely focused on delegitimizing criticism of Israeli actions and any organization that is remotely critical of Israeli actions (including Human Rights Watch, the entirety of the UN and everyone involved in the organization, Amnesty, Oxfam, Save the Children, Doctors Without Borders, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor and the World Health Organization). The media allowing representatives of the IDF to make statements as if they were a neutral party presenting an objective course of events also helps Israel control the narrative.

The enablers are other countries that through military and financial aid, continued trade and a lack of condemnation ensure that the Israeli assault on Gaza can continue. The US is the biggest enabler, and countries scared of losing the US as an ally if they were to act out of turn are likely more of an enabler to the US than they are to Israel. If the US were to change its position, they might therefore follow.

The flying monkeys are the people who are in it for themselves ‚Äì either for the status or for the money. Every politician taking money from the Israeli lobby would be in this category. Every tech CEO censoring social media platforms would be in this category, too.

Israel is being abusive not only towards Gaza, but also to its supposed allies. And we keep seeing Israel use tools straight out of the narcissist‚Äôs handbook. We see gaslighting when Israel tries to construe October 7^(th) as the beginning of the conflict, erasing their own oppression and massacre-riddled past. We see manipulation when Israel tries to evoke the Holocaust to guilt other countries into supporting them and equating anything not unequivocally supportive of the Israeli government with anti-Semitism. And we see DARVO when Israel denies all accusations of war crimes, promptly accuses the person raising concerns of siding with terrorists/being anti-Semitic and painting themselves ‚Äì a country with nuclear weapons, the second highest military spending per capita in the world and the unrestricted control of movement, food transports, water, electricity, whether a building should be reduced to rubble and whether a person should exist in the region where their enemy operates ‚Äì as facing an existential threat posed by a comparatively small organization without advanced weaponry, tanks or organized military that is also facing international condemnation. Then they use that DARVO logic to indiscriminately kill tens of thousands of unarmed men, women, and children. And the prayer starts right over.",2024-05-11T15:59:20+00:00

Don't lose your revolutionary optimism. The best advice I can offer to not do so is to let go of requisites for what you feel you should achieve personally. And don't tie your conviction to what we will achieve in our lifetime.

Let your values lead you. Let your humanity define your values. You are part of a movement to create a better world. We don't need to get there. We just need to never give up. Just as the people who came before us didn't, and the people who will come after us will look to us. When they do, they may just see the luminaries,  the way we do; the great orators, and the martyrs. But they will know, implicitly, about the millions who just did what they could, and never gave up.

israelexposed,comment,l3ncg9r,JeffThrowaway80,,"If you google 'Chabad' you'll find several sites that explain the messianic beliefs and the moshiach stuff. It all reads like very doomsday cult stuff to me - a great leader rises from the ranks of the Jewish people, there is widespread turmoil, suffering and a great battle that envelops the world. This leader will usher in the moshiach (messiah) and all nations of the world will bow to Israel and live by Jewish law. World peace will ensue, the laws of nature will change and the dead will come back to life.

I don't know how widespread these beliefs are in Israel though or if they reflect the beliefs of the leadership. One of the Zionist thugs who attacked the protesters was waving a moshiach flag though which is very disturbing and hasn't been mentioned enough. The flag suggested to me that the bearer was a follower of these messianic doomsday beliefs and I think that could make them very dangerous. If you think the outcome is world peace and the dead coming back to life then you could use that to justify killing anyone who got in your way for the greater good.

One of the Chabad sites says the moshiach will either come at a time when humanity is at its best and living in a utopia or when humanity is at its absolute worst and most depraved. If they believe this stuff and they know the positive option is pretty much impossible to achieve then it would be logical to try and be as absolutely depraved as possible to summon the messiah. It would certainly explain the barbarity, torture, mass killing and endless lying that is destabilising the world by turning the people against their corrupt governments. It feels like they're trying to be as awful as possible.

This included regions like Poland, Ukraine, and the Baltic states. The Nazis aimed to establish these settlements to support their ideological goals of expanding German living space ([Lebensraum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensraum)) It referred to the belief that the German people needed to expand their territory to accommodate their growing population and to establish dominance over other nations for security reasons.

Israel builds [settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement) in the territories it occupies, which include the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Golan, (previously built in Gaza and Sinai) for religious, nationalist, and sometimes strategic and security reasons All settlers are of exclusively Jewish identity, [and most of them come from an extremist and violent background.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settler_violence)

israelexposed,comment,l3jsb4g,MadJakeChurchill,,"The term Lebensraum was coined by Friedrich Ratzel after returning from an excursion to Western United States and its frontier. He was astonished by the settler life and yeomen staking out ‚Äòunclaimed‚Äô land that the government said was free for the stealing (from the indigenous people).

This idea of Lebensraum and frontier living penetrated the Second Reich so pervasively that much of German pop culture was dedicated to American cowboys and the ‚ÄòWild West‚Äô. Being raised in that time inevitably had an effect on Hitler, who saw a mirror parallel between America‚Äôs West and Germany‚Äôs Eastern neighbours. He deemed them to be using the land poorly, and created a racial hierarchy to justify their expulsion.

The parallels between the settlement of the West and the settlement of Nazi-invaded European land stem even deeper when you look at propaganda pictures of the time and see new German settler families setting off to Poland and the Baltics in horse-pulled WAGONS - just like the frontier settlers of America did!

They wish to maintain relations with China as they sell a lot of oil to them so will happily turn a blind eye to the genocide of the Uyghurs. Many other countries in the OIC have equally shitty human rights or are part of the belt and road initiative due to their corrupt leadership profiting from it even whilst their people will not and will just be exploited. Ultimately it's more profitable and easier for them to just turn a blind eye to the obvious genocide, lie and pretend it isn't happening in order to retain good relationships with China.

If you want the truth about the genocide of the Uyghurs then listen to the Uyghurs themselves. There are countless videos of them talking about their families being disappeared or women being forced to live with Han Chinese after their husbands are taken away. That plus all the ridiculous, lazy propaganda China puts out to try to deny the genocide. ie.

Also the fact that the ruling party BJP who promotes such stuff is ruling for the past 10 years and is probably gonna win this year's election as well clearly shows that many adult men and women in India support this as well.

Actually rape is a big part of the Hindutva ideology. The guy who developed Hindutva named VR Savarkar actually justified rape of Muslim women as a political tool and said it is okay if done for the sake of religion. Also Indian politician Yogi Adityanath openly talks about abducting Muslim women and converting them to Hinduism. His supporters even said that they should bring the bodies of dead Muslim women from the grave and rape them. Some politicians in India are also promising jobs and money to young Hindu men if they manage to sleep with Muslim women and convert them to Hinduism. Some men who raped Muslim women were even welcomed with sweets and garland by politicians when they got released from jail. And people were taking blessings from those men.

‚ÄúBelgium chocolate?‚Äù

If we‚Äôre talking about colonization and human rights abuses committed by European states, especially against poor and indigenous labor forces; Then Belgium‚Äôs history, and especially their imported chocolate (ain‚Äôt no cacao growing in Flanders) need to be put into proper prospective. 

All love and solidarity to the Belgian union standing up against Zionist colonialism and Western imperialism. Africa has been abused, drained, and deliberately underdeveloped by the West‚Äôs programmatic exploitation and genocidal capitalism, and Belgium has a heinous past. 

‚ÄúWhen Belgium colonized the Congo, they stepped up their chocolate-making game. It was here that they discovered a huge number of cocoa beans. Their ruler King Leopold III quickly took advantage of this, and Belgium became the main trader of cocoa and chocolate.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeopold's reign over the Congo Free State, however, has become infamous for its brutality. The people of the Congo were forced to labor for valued resources, including rubber and ivory, to personally enrich Leopold. Estimates vary, but about half the Congolese population died from punishment and malnutrition.‚Äù

https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/belgian-king-establishes-congo-free-state/#

‚ÄúForced labour, corporal punishments, kidnapping, and slaughtering of rebellious villages were among other atrocities recorded during the period. As international condemnation grew, the Belgian state took Congo over in 1908. The country achieved independence 52 years later, in 1960.‚Äù

israelexposed,comment,l3gm5hk,thecapitalparadox,,"While I had a very immediate and similar reaction to Belgian chocolate, the slave labour thing is complicated. There most definitely is quite a bit of child slave labour that occurs in the cocoa industry. However, the way it is combated by, for example, chocolate producers, is to certify the problem away with so-called fair/ethical trade. First, it poses challenges to smaller-scale cocao producers that will typically get absolutely demonised by NGOs and international organisations an such for involving their children in the production process, which is a very normal thing that people do in their professions and especially in agrarian societies across a wide spectrum of cultures. It is simple an activity that families do together and is one of many prongs of Western ethnocentrism. This is all not to say that addressing actual slave labour isn't a real and urgent issue - it's just that this particular method often misses the mark and hurts the livelihoods of people that do not use slave labour.

Then we have the additional issue being that so-called fair/ethical trade chocolate is hardly fair trade. It's really a misnomer and helps to completely was over how exploitative the industry is, as are most industries that rely on primary resource production/extraction. Cocao prices are, to put it bluntly, fucked. Cocoa processors and chocolate producers have quite literally created a cartel to deflate crop prices. Obviously, those who get hurt are the farmers who depend on the crop to sustain their livelihoods.

While there has recently been sharp increases in cocoa prices that is creating a perfect blowback for processors and chocolate producers, the reasons for these price increases are mostly bad. Yes, Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire intentionally raised prices but both governments are fairly well-entrenched in Western corporate interests so it's hard to say how much is really reaching the average farmer. However, the other reasons for price increases relate to reductions in supply likely due to a combination of poor pay and climate change that have led to issues such as pest infestation, yield reductions in general, and quality reductions. I'm not a massive expert but I have had some close involvement in the West African agricultural sector so this is kinda a high level overview.",2024-05-10T17:36:49+00:00

The point is that Zionism is the belief that Palestinians have to be expelled from their homeland to make way for Jewish settlers, although historically it was only Ashkenazi Jewish settlers and all other Jews were heavily discriminated against. Even today, Ethiopian Jews have a [very hard time in Israel](https://www.theracialequityinitiative.org/anti-black-racism-in-israel/) due to [rampant racism](https://twitter.com/MintPressNews/status/1595114386280304640?t=p2-Ta9KDV_8pBIUdjzjTPg). May Golan, a far-right politician who proclaimed that she is proud to be racist, became a top diplomat to New York and it currently the minister for the advancement of women‚Äôs status. By the way, anti-Arab racism is still racism. Please note that [‚ÄúDeath to Arabs!‚Äù](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_to_Arabs) is a common chant in Israel. Lastly, apartheid is racist. Israel literally has a law that says that self-determination in Israel is ‚Äúunique to the Jewish people,‚Äù and this law also encourages the construction to Jewish-only communities, effectively promoting segregation.
 
Gay marriage is not legal at all in Israel. Claiming that it is legal in ‚Äúsome jurisdictions‚Äù is pure disinformation. To get the full picture, civil marriages as a whole are illegal in Israel. Interfaith marriages are also illegal on account of this.

israelexposed,comment,l3l5mnj,bluesimplicity,,"Here is today's email to the President:

‚ÄúYou may choose to look the other way, but you can never say again that you did not know.‚Äù 

Israel is violating U.S. laws:

1. Multiple provisions in U.S. law restrict the sale or provision of weapons to other countries, including the federal Arms Export Control Act, the Foreign Assistance Act, and the Leahy Law which prohibit military assistance to forces engaged in gross violations of human rights. The ICC has ruled that the claim that Israel is engaging in genocide is credible.

2. The U.S. Foreign Assistance Act requires Israel to uphold international humanitarian law and allow free flows of U.S. assistance. Israel has violated U.S. law by  deliberate withholding of humanitarian aid to Gaza. 

3. American aid to Israel is illegal under U.S. law passed in the 1970s that prohibits aid to nuclear powers who don‚Äôt sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

We must cease weapons transfers to Israel immediately.

We must demand the humanitarian aid in trucks at the border be allowed into Gaza immediately.

We must fully fund UNRWA to effectively distribute that aid.

We must demand an immediate, permanent ceasefire.

We must see the withdrawal of all Israel troops from Gaza immediately. 

We must rebuild Gaza for the Palestinians much like the Marshall Plan.

We must demand that Palestinian prisoners -- many children -- being held in administrative detention without trial or rights be released immediately. 

We must move towards one country with democracy, equal rights, and citizenship for all people --Jews, Muslims, and Christians, Arab and Israeli together -- in one secular, democratic Palestine. A single-state solution for Palestine reflects the reality that the two-state option is dead. One Democratic State is the only way to achieve justice and permanent peace by dismantling the colonial apartheid regime returning stolen property to all victims of dispossession.",2024-05-11T15:45:11+00:00

Israel allowed Hamas to develop. Multiple officials have said that in retrospect it was probably a mistake, but Israel didn‚Äôt want the PLO in power and so they turned a blind eye to and in some cases actively aided other political groups vying for power in Palestine, the result of which is Hamas. And now, whether part of a plan or not, Hamas‚Äô actions are being used as a convenient political scapegoat to commit mass murder against the Palestinian people, which has always been Israel‚Äôs prerogative.

Please for the love of humanity we can't let this happen. I don't care who's doing the oppression, if you're gonna bomb civilians you aren't the good guys. Why Israel? Why? You want to represent the state of the Jewish People right? Why would you want this to be a part of that states legacy? Zionism makes sense if Mandatory Palestine was unoccupied by people, say the area has no residents, okay yeah, take the land, sure. But there were people settled there, I understand the desire for your own state, I understand this desire came from centuries of oppression, having attrocities committed against you changes people.

No matter how many you kill, or how many voices you can silence, what's wrong will always be wrong. You will die, and the world will recover, and once the world gets comfortable again, they will forget, they will forget the signs of fascism, they will forget the manipulation, they won't know.

And yes the way idf has been handling the situation, like for example they‚Äôre just leveling neighborhoods.

The idf could be handling the situation better tho, it‚Äôs the modern age.

I just remember trying to wrap my head around how the Nazis had the entirety of Germany and a good chunk of Europe on their side, and thinking it must be a product of the times.  That that can't happen now.  And now we have Israel calling the people they are colonizing, displacing, segregating, and genociding ""Nazis"" as quite literally their last resort to justify the atrocities they are committing as being somehow any different.  And watching propagandists on the news drop those words out of their mouths without a shred of irony.  As Jewish activists against apartheid are removed from campuses in Germany and having their voices silenced for being anti-semitic.  Oh, the life in Gaza until very recently was much better than most WWII concentration camps?  I guess it isn't happening at all.  As the 5000th IDF viral video comes out on tiktok of them destroying yet another family home and mocking the former inhabitants.  


Justification isn't even in the forefront of their minds anymore, to them this in unquestionably just.   The only difference now is that the whole world is watching, and they can no longer hide behind their lies.  Any potential good faith argument they have left falls apart with each passing hour.  They've already proved with this that it was never about the hostages.  Palestinian deaths and land mean more to Zionists than Israeli lives.",2024-05-09T03:38:48+00:00

While I do think there are certain powers within the US who want the genocide in Palestine to escalate on the religious and defense industry-profiteering side of things, the fact of the matter is that this conflict is a complete public opinion disaster for the sitting US government. Most within the Biden administration would have preferred that it not escalate the way it has behind closed doors, not because they care one bit about Palestinian lives, but because they do care about winning elections and maintaining relatively stable public opinion (both of which are teetering on complete disaster in large part because of the escalation of this genocide and the US's inaction in response). 

Israel is a colonial outpost that has proven it cannot be controlled by its masters and is now unilaterally making decisions and US leadership is so spineless and weak that it just goes along with this state of affairs instead of reasserting control via showing it could figuratively starve Israel into submission by withholding funding and weapons - even temporarily - until Israel re-establishes a more stable status quo. Even from the perspective of a colonialist/imperial overlord, the US is showing complete weakness and cowardice as it bends backwards for Israel while it openly defies what the US wants it to do. Obviously their spinelessness is largely influenced by those previously mentioned defense industry lobbies and Israeli-backed funding of politicians' election campaigns, but it has gotten to the point that ""red lines"" that the Biden administration has previously publicly stated could not be crossed or else they would cause a change in policy towards Israel (such as invading Rafah) are now being re-defined as the Biden administration weakly bends over backwards so the Israeli government can do whatever it wants while clearly ignoring even the US's direct attempts to help broker a ceasefire. 

Israel escalating this genocide while stoking tensions with Iran, which could escalate to a wider regional conflict, is NOT what the US wants because the US literally cannot afford to be directly involved in what would be a far more costly and lengthy war than Iraq and Afghanistan combined, especially as they gear up to face off against China over Taiwan and the Pacific waters and islands off the coast of SE Asia. The US and its defense industries wants a status quo where they can keep manufacturing and supplying arms to nations that saber rattle at each other indefinitely (which was the status quo between Iran and Israel previously as well as North and South Korea as examples) or that are engaged in more minor proxy conflicts that can be turned into quagmires that can continually receive arms for the foreseeable future (such as in Ukraine). What they don't want is a ""hot war"" between superpowers or major regional powers because a world war that could result from that would likely also result in industrial production capacity getting destroyed by ICBMs and countries like the US devastating their own economies via fully engaging its military in worldwide conflict, which would result in loss of continual profits for the defense industries ultimately, not gains, and these industries are motivated first and foremost by profit.",2024-05-09T14:35:50+00:00

I'll tell you how. Stop recording and fuckin run to the smoke and pick up a kid like others are doing. 

Get them as far away from the smoke as possible, just that can harm a person, esp a child. Start providing basic first aid, i.e finding any type of cloth like a shirt and use it as a turnakit if severe bleeding, find anything to use as a disinfectant or clean the wounds as best as you can.

I'm sorry, but this is the problem with bystander syndrome. Too many people see a crisis and either stand in shock or pull out their phones. I disagree with you that it's futile and the fact you think it is is concerning to me. 

All cultures have medical treatments that does not require traditional education to learn. Usually passed down through generations. And that is better than nothing. The assumption that all Palestinian civilians are under educated in basic first aid is just that, an assumption. 

Esp with internet, which to upload the videos we are seeing means some of them have it. So they can even learn from that. 

And yes, we don't know the situation but doesn't mean you can't help. Look, the video shows people helping, so the first point you made is moot because whether they are banning and bombing doesn't mean citizens can't risk their safety to help. Not doing that is prioritizing self preservation over helping others. Which is their choice but what doesn't help is recording in a crisis. We can agree to disagree but if you subscribe to its futile or its hopeless then you are telling them to give up trying to help. basically lay down, and let their fellow civilians die. Not the type of world we should live in and if this is the basis for our morality then we are seriously backwards.

israelexposed,comment,l3cnm69,BoIshevik,,"In many African nations, I'm only sure here as those are the ones I've delved into, there are many of these children who are violently removed from their families. Perhaps by massacring them, and then forced into combat. A 12 year old boy will obey. He watches his loved ones die and then a man tells him it's time to fight to avenge them or to end this. Likely you don't want to end up like your loved ones so you obey. 

It's not as simple as them ""picking up a weapon' as if they in their youth decided they will be in combat because it's what they want. 

Even those soldiers are victims if you ask me. Personally I am of the mind many soldiers are, but are not victims in that they need help or deserve it, but in that they have been manipulated into doing what they are - as adults they should know better. especially once their behavior becomes more than just being a soldier and is being a tyrant, rapist, murderer, whatever you got. 

Regardless I'm not sure what the OG comment was but it's a hard situation. Anyways what we are seeing here are **not child soldiers**. Boys and girls 0-10 in character PJs with their parents holding them or their body they're clearly innocent children Israelis intend on genociding.",2024-05-09T22:41:33+00:00

The British have also been involved in many wars and pillaging. If we go back to the times of the crusades and the white people of the Roman empire, I'm sure we'll see similar numbers. You can count the Europeans too, who were and are predominantly white.

Although this isn't about race, we shouldn't kid ourselves here. Why shouldn't we be unapologetic in stating the obvious? They've tried to pin this on Islam and the Arabs for centuries. I think it's just fair that they should be highlighted now.

If you are white, European or American, don't feel bad about what I'm saying. We don't need your apology either. As someone who is of Asian descent and of a Muslim background, I believe I have a shared right to defend many of my Muslim brothers and sisters who have suffered at the lies and deceit spewed by the West for centuries.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has been systematically censoring Palestinian voices and content supporting Palestine, according to multiple human rights organizations. This censorship is not only a violation of free speech but also a complicit act in Israel‚Äôs ongoing oppression of the Palestinian people.



Access Now has reported that Meta has been censoring Palestinian voices through arbitrary content removals, account suspensions, ‚Äúshadow-banning,‚Äù and other restrictions, especially during times of war. This censorship is not only a violation of free speech but also a complicit act in Israel‚Äôs ongoing oppression of the Palestinian people.



Human Rights Watch (HRW) has documented a pattern of undue removal and suppression of protected speech in support of Palestine on Instagram and Facebook. They identified six key patterns of censorship, including content removals, account suspensions, inability to engage with content, and ‚Äúshadow banning‚Äù in at least 100 instances each. This censorship is not only a violation of free speech but also a complicit act in Israel‚Äôs ongoing oppression of the Palestinian people.



HRW found that Meta invoked its ‚ÄúDangerous Organizations and Individuals‚Äù policy to remove content, which fully incorporates U.S. designated lists of ‚Äúterrorist organizations.‚Äù Meta also misapplied policies on violent content, hate speech, and nudity to censor Palestine-related posts. This censorship is not only a violation of free speech but also a complicit act in Israel‚Äôs ongoing oppression of the Palestinian people.",2024-05-07T22:27:05+00:00

They are providing schools, medical care, as well as basic supplies to Palestinians in all the neighbouring areas, including Lebanon and West Bank. UNRWA is a serious help to many Palestinians and is facing incredible challenges with such a decrease in funds.

Please donate, if you can. As for any charity, a monthly donation is better even if small, because you allow them to plan on longer periods.

And you don't think that's accurate? Your side will always defend the actions on 10/7 because they're so oppressed and have the right to be angry. Why would that change for the next generation?

The [programming they show to children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow%27s_Pioneers) completely brainwash them and celebrate hating Jews. They lie and say Israel wants to takeover or demolish Al-Aqsa.

The martyr's fund encourages the youth to try and kill Jews to help their family financially. Martyrdom is celebrated as an honorable thing to strive for.

israelexposed,comment,l310rku,thecapitalparadox,,"Yep. if you even just look at the governance structures of all these international organisations, they are set up in such a way that the governments of a few Western countries have massive voting power and, in several cases, veto power, while having either direct or de facto power to make their own appointments to the highest posts within these institutions. 

It has always been about a very particular type of international order, namely one that has existed for hundreds of years. They may have largely stopped with state-sponsored trafficking of non-citizens to be used as slave labor and may have mostly stopped with exerting direct and absolute control over colonies. But colonial power structures have never really been dismantled - in fact, I would argue that since the widespread adoption of neoliberal ideology and adoption and enforcement of its associated policies that colonial power structures were fortified well beyond anything seen from the 1400s through the mid 1900s.",2024-05-07T19:57:32+00:00

The occupation, expulsion, disposession and ethnic cleansing is a fundamental part of the fabric of Israel's existence. Ben Gurion would be described as a left-wing politician but he also was root-and-branch committed to the expulsion of the native people of Palestine from their ancestral land by force.

That's exact the kind of attitude that makes Israel look so bad in the eyes of many people around the world. It doesn't need Hamas propaganda to achive that. Israel is quite good at achieving this on its own.  

Israeli government expects others to take all the blame for everything bad happening, and wants to accept no limitations for its own goals and ways to reach them. This is 110% self centered and 0% cooperative or empathic. 

And it has all the ingredients to end up in the exact genocidal dynamic people fear or see already. If you can only see yourself win when others are absolute submissiv and you except nothing but a win while others don't accept to do everything you want, what else should be the result? 

Israel flatened Gaza completely and still claims it needs to beat Hamas harder for the sake of peace? When will this kind of peace be achieved and when will it be good enough for Israel? Palestinans will continue to rebel, as long as they exist. And so Israels 'peace logic' will end up in a never ending chain of attrocities until every resistance is eliminated in the region.

israelexposed,comment,l2yc9p9,Quen-Tin,,"You think after Israel getting its overpowered revenge now for months instead of weeks after October, that Hamas got what it wanted? Everything? Including draging Lebanon and Iran into the war? I can't understand how you think, that the beating Hamas and the civil Palestinians got are not disproportional, but even underproportional in favour of Hamas. The only victory Hamas got was Israel giving its best to look like the aggressor in many peoples eyes, who had strong feelings for Israel before. But that was not achieved by Hamas who I consider as terrorists, but by Israel who has more and more difficulties to look like a peaceful democracy just wanting to live in peace. 

Yes, Hamas will likely continue to try to attack Israelis, including civilians. And yes, Israel will likely continue to keep control over a jewish non secular state by limiting and reducing the influence of non jewish inhabitants of the region, for example by occupying the Westbanks and not seeking a two state or one state solution with equal rights of all residents legitimated by different narratives of ownership resulting out of a complex history, where no side started anything, but all sides contributed in good and in bad ways to the actual situation and patterns of violence that haunt the region for decades. 

Speaking about human shields and hostages: if Hamas is hiding behind civilians in an overpopulated area, then hiding illegal settlers expansion behind claims of self defense might also be mixing up civilian and military interests on both sides. And what about uncounted Palestinians sitting in Israeli prisons without trials for months, including children? Is that the moral lighthouse of the region? Did you know, that the Westbanks experienced one of the bloodiest years for Palestinians before October? Without Hamas ruling the Westbanks, but with radicalized settlers claiming more and more land and protected by a military, that left the Gaza borders unprotected. Lead by a government in witch the PM will face prosecution as soon as he stops to make his radical ministers happy and the coalition falls apart or the war ends. Colliding interests, I guess. Speaking about a government, that was voted for by enough Israelis to come in power but then didn't give a sh*t about the liberal part of the jewish society when pressing for democracy endangering judical reforms. While Palestinians in Gaza had no chance to vote for or against Hamas in the past 16 years. Now who is actively contributing to the actual situation? The civilians dying in Gaza, while many Israelis say that there is no innocent Palestinian in Gaza, but complain when Hamas or Iran would say likewise about Israeli civilians? 

You are right ... war crimes shouldn't be legalized. Neighter formal nor informal. And Hamas did a lot to depict their own cruelty not just during the October terror. And so did countless IDF soldiers in their drome and tiktok videos or members in the Israeli parliamenent during their speeches. 

The conflict was there before Hamas existed. And it will not stop if Hamas will stop to exist in an unforseeable future. But Israel had its time to achive its goals in the current round of mutual escalation and it failed (again). More Palestinian blood will not path the way to a safer future for Israel. So stop hoping for solving the problem by escalating non working attempts. It's enough! Safety has to be reached otherwise and retaliation was there, more than enough.",2024-05-07T08:40:35+00:00

USA's support and mild chiding of ""stop, I'm concerned about Rafah"" falls on deaf ears when it's clear they are tacit in their approval of it.

Germany always stood for genociders, so it doesn't surprise me that they had banned all the imagery, all the speeches to try to deny their history and failure of healing.  If they had truly learned, then they would learn not to side with the genociders. It's not deniable anymore. ""Who knew what when"". ""I was just following orders"" is not a valid excuse at the Nuremburg trials, and it won't be an excuse going forward.

But the USA already knows that this looks bad. It's why they're threatening the ICC court, a WAR CRIME, to not issue an obvious warrant for a war criminal Netanyahu.

But, regardless, let this testimony serve as a reminder to every one of us that conflating zionism with the values of Judaism and the aspirations of all jews will NEVER be acceptable. And that if that ignorant, hateful generalisation were to ever take solid root within the antizionist movement, it would be the death of it. Zionism is fascism. Fascism is distilled selfishness. A drop of it is poison to the soul.

Whomever you are, whatever your conception of yourself, you are not immune. Your national, ethnic, religious identity, i.e., the conception of yourself that you use to fit into a social group; that group is not immune. If anything, that is the most likely vector of transmition.

NEVER EVER let anything but your humanity lead you in word and deed in this fight. Do not let your anger turn to undisciplined hate. What we aim to expose here is the criminal inhumanity inherent in zionism and all colonialism and the hateful dehumanisation that Israel promotes. We can not do that honestly if we tolerate the same from ourselves or our own ranks.

I know what we've been witnessing is very emotionally evocative, to say the least, and the attitude of zionists is disgusting. But don't forget your own humanity. It's what separates you from fascists like zionists. Don't even forget theirs. By all means hate their weakness.They are sick and cruel, but even they are still humans, most of whom were indoctrinated from birth and are too weak to have the courage (of this man) to break away from the pack that they feel they belong to.",2024-05-06T07:40:54+00:00

He also discusses how American media, paralleling the propaganda of the Israeli lobby, deliberately trivialises such violence and misleads the public. 

As Hedges points out, this reflects how such media including outlets that enjoy a ‚Äúliberal‚Äù or ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù reputation like The New York Times ‚Äúembraces American militarism‚Äù, contemptuous of both human life and the possibility of peace grounded in actual principles of justice.

He and the majority of his fellow members of Congress, object to the principle that people have a right to know about and to express their thoughts and feelings about what's going on in the world.

They, quite frankly and obviously, are betraying and foresaking the oath they swore.

However, you say ""1400 people"", implying those were all civilians, and then ""countless"" civilians to boot. Both are objectively (and easily provably) wrong.

The final count of deaths was 1139 (so less than 1400 even counting soldiers), of which 373 were IDF personnel (imposing the blockade on Gaza and thus legitimate military targets) meaning 786 civilians (of which 695 were Israeli) were killed.

It was only many years later that the UNHCR was established and it's honestly baffling to me that it took so long for the UN to figure that out. And the thing is that Palestinian refugees would probably be better off with UNHCR, since it's a larger centralized agency with better funding that's less vulnerable to political machinations like what the Zionists pulled with defunding UNRWA. But Zionists don't want that, they just want to leave Palestinians either destitute or dead. Another thing they hope you don't know about is that UNRWA initially also served Jewish refugees, but ""Israel"" offered to service them instead and thereby resolve the Jewish refugee problem, yet ""for whatever reason"" no such accommodations have been made for Palestinian refugees.",2024-05-05T04:00:54+00:00

The Palestinian conflict is 75 years old and due to simple fact that Zionists displaced millions of Palestinians to other countries (many Latin American/ western countries). Is the reason why there is so much attention. Palestinian diaspora have been trying to figure out how to support this cause for 75 years and I think they cracked the code. The support would not have happened without the education they instilled in the entire Arab diaspora and middle eastern studies conflict classes throughout the world. They‚Äôve written books, created many activists, simplified it to people on social media. They have created the MARKET for their cause. Because a strategy is the key to success. 

The BDS movement is an old concept and no one was doing it like they are today. Palestinians have been spreading their story and MARKETING like crazy to every country they are displaced in for the past 75 years and that should not go unnoticed. 

The marketing education done by Palestinians for the past 75 years is the reason they are succeeding.

Not many Sudanese diaspora is simplifying it and asking other Arabs to help out. Not much infographics on insta or tiktok. Not much videos to draw attention. Not much coverage. At the end of the day it‚Äôs marketing education. And I haven‚Äôt seen much Sudanese or African diaspora breaking conflicts down. You may say it‚Äôs shallow, well it took 75 years for the entire world to say end the occupation now! 

You need to understand that every single Palestinian on this earth is speaking out every day. Since before Oct 7th. They‚Äôve made thousands and thousands of insta and tik tok pages to educate people. They‚Äôve gotten Palestinians in high up places to speak up. Palestinians have also been displaced for decades, so they have assimilated and created wealth in the west which has abled them to have higher positions. This shouldn‚Äôt go unnoticed!! 

I don‚Äôt see this effort for other African diasporas. 
I truly believe it‚Äôs the diasporas responsibility to help their people, spread awareness and etc. Like it or not it‚Äôs about marketing not about what country they‚Äôre from. 

For instance, I remember when invisible children was a thing and everyone wanted to be apart of helping Uganda. They got white people screaming for Ugandans even though invisible children was kind of a scam.

israelexposed,comment,l2o6blh,Approximate-Infinite,,"It's terrible how places like Sudan and Congo don't get much attention from Western media simply because they are in Africa.

I think one of the reasons why Palestine has gotten so much attention on social media is because the western media has spent decades propping up Israel's image and now it's falling down like a house of cards. Many people feel enraged that that the news reporting has so often been at odds with the reality and they feel they have been lied to for a long time. There's also a feeling that Israel and its supporters are incredibly hypocritical and hypocrisy is something that can easily get under people's skins.

When it comes to African conflicts, the western media may report on it sometimes but they rarely take a particular side. There's usually some western involvement behind the scenes, but they don't really care about persuading the population to support a particular 'side'. Conflicts in Africa are often presented as endemic to the continent and no mention is made of how European colonialism and neo-colonialism has played a part in it. Sadly Africa is presented as a homogenous entity associated with constant war, famine and suffering.

In other words, you can talk more freely about African conflicts compared to Palestine/Israel, where you could be accused of ""anti-semetism"" and the American government is actively trying to limit free speech on it. I could be wrong, but I don't think any African conflict (expect maybe Apartheid South Africa) has had such a push by Western Media and government so support only one side like it has with Israel. The problem with African conflicts is that reporting in western media is limited so people are less exposed to it. There also aren't any major African groups who influence media and government the way AIPAC does, so naturally Israel/Palestine becomes a major point of focus.",2024-05-05T10:50:00+00:00

The Palestinian conflict is 75 years old and due to simple fact that Zionists displaced millions of Palestinians to other countries (many Latin American/ western countries). Is the reason why there is so much attention. Palestinian diaspora have been trying to figure out how to support this cause for 75 years and I think they cracked the code. The support would not have happened without the education they instilled in the entire Arab diaspora and middle eastern studies conflict classes throughout the world. They‚Äôve written books, created many activists, simplified it to people on social media. They have created the MARKET for their cause. Because a strategy is the key to success. 

The BDS movement is an old concept and no one was doing it like they are today. Palestinians have been spreading their story and MARKETING like crazy to every country they are displaced in for the past 75 years and that should not go unnoticed.

i have a questtionChatGPT

**ChatGPT**

Of course! What's your question?

üì∑**You** what are the similarities between nazi Germany and the current Israeli government given their policies and actions in Gaza over the last 7 months?

**ChatGPT**

Drawing parallels between Nazi Germany and the current Israeli government can be a sensitive and contentious topic, as it involves complex historical and political contexts. While there may be some superficial similarities in certain policies or actions, it's crucial to approach such comparisons with caution and nuance.

Some individuals and groups have pointed to perceived similarities between the two, particularly in relation to military actions, occupation, and treatment of minority populations. Critics of the Israeli government's policies towards Palestinians in Gaza may draw comparisons to Nazi Germany's treatment of Jews during World War II, citing issues such as restrictions on movement, military checkpoints, and the use of force.

However, it's important to note that making direct comparisons between the two regimes can oversimplify complex geopolitical dynamics and historical contexts. The motivations, ideologies, and historical circumstances driving the actions of Nazi Germany and the Israeli government are fundamentally different.

Additionally, engaging in such comparisons risks trivializing the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime and the unique historical context of the Holocaust. While criticism of government policies and actions is valid and necessary in any democratic society, equating contemporary governments with one of history's most notorious regimes can undermine meaningful dialogue and understanding.

Instead of focusing on comparisons, it's often more productive to analyze and critique specific policies and actions within their own historical, political, and humanitarian contexts. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the complexities involved and fosters constructive discourse on how to address ongoing conflicts and human rights issues.

2 / 2üì∑**You**

can you actually state the historical facts instead of an Israeli narrative where you don't uplift the Jews and demonize the Arabs? can you be truly centrist in this manner?

**ChatGPT**

Certainly, let's examine historical facts without bias toward any particular narrative:

1. **Occupation and Control**: Both Nazi Germany and the current Israeli government have been criticized for their policies of occupation and control over certain territories. Nazi Germany occupied and annexed various territories during World War II, implementing harsh policies against the populations of these areas. Similarly, the Israeli government has occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip since the Six-Day War in 1967, leading to the establishment of Israeli settlements and imposing restrictions on the movement of Palestinians.
2. **Treatment of Minority Populations**: Nazi Germany infamously targeted Jews, Roma, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other minority groups for persecution, leading to the systematic genocide of six million Jews in the Holocaust. In the Israeli-Palestinian context, critics argue that the Israeli government's policies and actions towards Palestinians in the occupied territories have led to human rights violations, including displacement, restrictions on movement, and military operations resulting in civilian casualties.
3. **Use of Force**: Both regimes have faced criticism for their use of force against civilian populations. Nazi Germany employed brutal tactics, including mass executions and concentration camps, to suppress dissent and eliminate perceived threats to the regime. In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Israeli government has faced condemnation for its military operations in Gaza, which have resulted in civilian casualties and destruction of infrastructure.
4. **International Response**: The actions of both Nazi Germany and the Israeli government have sparked international condemnation and calls for accountability. Nazi Germany's atrocities during World War II led to the Nuremberg Trials and the establishment of international laws and conventions aimed at preventing genocide and protecting human rights. Similarly, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been the subject of numerous United Nations resolutions, international investigations, and calls for a peaceful resolution based on international law.

It's important to recognize that while there may be similarities in certain policies and actions, the historical contexts, motivations, and ideologies of Nazi Germany and the Israeli government are fundamentally different. Additionally, discussions about these issues should prioritize factual accuracy, empathy toward all affected populations, and a commitment to promoting peace, justice, and human rights for all.

üì∑**You**

again you show bias toward Israel with your terminology. nazis killed/persecuted Jews but Israel is only accused. please give me a truly unbiased answer where it is truly fair to both sides

**ChatGPT**

I appreciate your perspective, and I'll strive for impartiality in presenting historical facts without favoring one side over the other:

1. **Occupation and Control**: Nazi Germany annexed territories and imposed control over various regions during World War II, implementing oppressive policies against the populations in these areas. Similarly, the Israeli government has occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip since the Six-Day War in 1967, leading to the establishment of Israeli settlements and imposing restrictions on the movement and daily lives of Palestinians.
2. **Treatment of Minority Populations**: Nazi Germany systematically targeted and persecuted Jews, Roma, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other minority groups, resulting in the genocide of six million Jews in the Holocaust. In the Israeli-Palestinian context, there are allegations and documented cases of human rights violations committed by the Israeli government against Palestinians, including displacement, restrictions on movement, and military operations causing civilian casualties.
3. **Use of Force**: Both regimes have faced criticism for their use of force against civilian populations. Nazi Germany employed brutal tactics, including mass executions and concentration camps, to suppress dissent and eliminate perceived threats. In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Israeli military has conducted operations in Gaza and the West Bank, leading to civilian casualties and infrastructure damage, while Palestinian militant groups have also engaged in violence against Israeli civilians.
4. **International Response**: The actions of both Nazi Germany and the Israeli government have generated international condemnation and calls for accountability. Nazi Germany's atrocities during World War II led to the Nuremberg Trials and the establishment of international laws and conventions aimed at preventing genocide and protecting human rights. Similarly, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been the subject of numerous United Nations resolutions, international investigations, and calls for a peaceful resolution based on international law and the principles of justice and human rights.

It's important to approach discussions about historical events and conflicts with sensitivity, empathy, and a commitment to understanding the perspectives of all affected parties. By acknowledging the complexities and nuances of these issues, we can work towards fostering dialogue, reconciliation, and ultimately, a just and lasting peace for all involved.

üì∑**You**

in point no 2 you mention the amount of Jews killed, please add the amount of Palestinians killed and revise the whole statement

**ChatGPT**

Certainly, I'll adjust the statement to include the requested information:

1. **Treatment of Minority Populations**: Nazi Germany systematically targeted and persecuted Jews, Roma, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other minority groups, resulting in the genocide of six million Jews in the Holocaust. In the Israeli-Palestinian context, there are allegations and documented cases of human rights violations committed by the Israeli government against Palestinians, including displacement, restrictions on movement, and military operations causing civilian casualties. According to various sources, including the United Nations, human rights organizations, and Palestinian authorities, thousands of Palestinians have been killed in conflicts with Israel since 1948, with estimates ranging from tens of thousands to over one hundred thousand. These casualties include civilians, militants, and children.

üì∑**You**

You're correct, and I appreciate your clarification. Here's a revised statement with a more accurate representation:

1. **Treatment of Minority Populations**: Nazi Germany systematically targeted and persecuted Jews, Roma, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other minority groups, resulting in the genocide of six million Jews in the Holocaust. In the Israeli-Palestinian context, there are allegations and documented cases of human rights violations committed by the Israeli government against Palestinians, including displacement, restrictions on movement, and military operations causing civilian casualties. According to various sources, including the United Nations, human rights organizations, and Palestinian authorities, it's estimated that tens of thousands to over one hundred thousand Palestinians have been killed in conflicts with Israel since 1948. These casualties include civilians, militants, and children. The exact number remains a subject of debate due to the complexities of conflict and differing methodologies of counting casualties.

**ChatGPT**

Approximately six million Jews were killed during the Holocaust perpetrated by Nazi Germany and its collaborators.

üì∑**You**

how many Palestinians died?

**ChatGPT**

The exact number of Palestinians who have died in conflicts with Israel since 1948 is difficult to determine precisely due to various factors such as differing methodologies of counting casualties, ongoing conflict, and the complex nature of the situation. Estimates range from tens of thousands to over one hundred thousand.

üì∑**You**

who killed them?

**ChatGPT**

The deaths of Palestinians in conflicts with Israel have occurred in various circumstances involving a range of actors. These include casualties resulting from military operations conducted by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), clashes between Palestinian militants and Israeli security forces, targeted airstrikes, artillery shelling, and other forms of violence within the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Additionally, there have been instances of Palestinian casualties resulting from intra-Palestinian violence and armed confrontations between rival factions. It's important to recognize that attributing responsibility for specific deaths in a complex and protracted conflict like the Israeli-Palestinian one can be challenging and contentious, and different perspectives may offer differing interpretations of events and culpability",2024-05-04T23:01:10+00:00

Following World War II, certain NAZI / ZIONIST groups remained intact, and some of their leading figures, including scientists, relocated to the United States. This migration played a role in advancing nuclear technology, aligning with the goals of the Nazi regime and the aspirations for the US to become a global empire. These individuals eventually assimilated into American society, often securing high-ranking positions in government. Today, it's plausible to suggest that elements of U.S. policies and perceived corruption can be linked to the influence of these NAZI / ZIONIST figures and their integration into American life. It's a complex narrative, one that prompts us to consider various perspectives. As for Hitler's motives, there are different interpretations, including theories about collaboration or conspiracy, but it's essential to approach such claims with critical thinking and open-mindedness.

There's a few things you  have to consider:

1.  Nazis were banal. they were not black-blooded psychos, they were just regular people who really believed the ideology, or who did what they were told. ANYONE could be a nazi with the right circumstances.
2. The OG nazis got most of their bad ideas, money and technology from the USA. Extermination, concentration camps, lebensraum, manifest destiny, all USA.
3. This means that the inspiration, driving force and ideology of the Nazis never fell, even if Hitler etc did.
4. However much Hitler believed what he said, or Mussolini, they were the visible face of fascism. The useful idiots. The real power behind all of that was US finance. And it never went anywhere.
5. Operation paperclip and so on did smuggle lots of fash out of Germany, Ukraine etc into USA, Canada etc. But these were the expendable footsoldiers, useful idiots.

Yeah, maybe by zionists. For people that care about history, they were terrorists. From the last line of the Wikipedia summary:

Like Saddam Hussein for example, i wouldn't say he was a saint but he did try to protect Palestine and intended to destroy zionazi which you know America as usual will do anything to label him as modern h*tler and etc. that started a Gulf War even before 9/11 was relevant. Ever heard the WMD in Iraq that they say about the invasion? Well, turns out there's nothing nor any evidence that they find such a weapon or a secret lab BS.

Well, i can't tell for sure but upon my short time analysis he does involve with inspection of bio-chemical weapon and stuff like that during Soviet Union era or in other words The Cold War including involvement in Iraq-Iran War. Part of the member in United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), a WMD dossier. What happened to him exactly? I don't know, gotta have some legitimate information for that.

He died in 2003, which is way before the invasion of Iraq hunting down for (fake) WMD that caused millions of civilian Iraqi murdered by the US. 

Now whether or not either Iran or Iraq did use a chemical weapon during Halabja Massacre, it remains controversy to this day. From what i understand, it is a conflict war between Iran and Iraq and you guessed it, US involvement. Which side USA on? Iraq. Then what are the US conclusion to blame upon who uses the chemical weapon? Both. Yep, BOTH. Typical isn't it? Tell me if this isn't just a deceptional alliance then backstab them when the mission is completed.

Don't get me started that only couple of years later after that conflict, the Gulf War begin. Then there's this b**** (sorry to say) Nayirah Testimony who lied about Saddam k*lling babies in incubators on Kuwait. Which she also part of America's puppet.

Then Afghan Civil War which Osama bin Laden were supported by the US, UK, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and France (keep in mind, this is during 1989 Afghan Civil War). Yet somehow Islam/Muslim got labelled as the terroriz when you have a literal psychopath leaders/state destroying other countries.

israelexposed,comment,l2c8hb3,Master_Xenu,,"Here's an article with some more information.

https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/6202

>Euro-Med Monitor documented the Israeli army‚Äôs killing of a Palestinian man called Jamal Hamdi Hassan Ashour (62) who was deliberately run over in Gaza City‚Äôs Al-Zaytoun neighbourhood on 29 February after he was arrested. The father of five was subjected to harsh interrogation by members of the Israeli army, who bound his hands with plastic zip-tie handcuffs before running him over with a military vehicle from the bottom to the top of his body.

He wasn't the only one, the report says there were dozens of people run over by tanks.

edit:  These monsters are running over people sleeping in their tents and cars.

>Another documented incident took place on 23 January, when an Israeli tank ran over members of the Ghannam family while they were sleeping in a shelter caravan in the Taiba Towers area of Khan Younis. As a result, a man and his eldest daughter were killed, and his remaining three children and wife were injured. Amina, his 13-year-old daughter, confirmed that her father and older sister were killed when an Israeli tank unexpectedly and repeatedly ran over the caravan, where the family had been sleeping. While her mother and two other siblings survived the attack, Amina experienced extreme pressure in her eyes, nearly losing her sight.

>Euro-Med Monitor also documented Israeli tanks and bulldozers running over and crushing displaced people inside their tents in Beit Lahia‚Äôs Kamal Adwan Hospital courtyard on 16 December 2023. Several people were killed during the incident, including individuals who were initially injured and did not ultimately survive. The corpses of those who had been previously buried in the courtyard were also crushed in the 16 December incident, stated the rights group.",2024-05-03T02:11:43+00:00

They have been gifted with multiple cease fires and restarted hostilities in every case. It is entirely their fault.

Israel has been attacked for 75 years and defending itself after they declared independence. They are responding to the attacks and oppression of innocent Israeli citizens. 

> Israel steals land, steals homes, bulldozes olive groves. All long before October 7. Long before Hamas even existed.

Yes - they did this back when instead of Hamas it was the PLO - which was also a terrorist organization. 

> You have no humanity. You have no soul. 

You have been duped and allowed your mind to be hijacked by evil mysoginistic, racist murderers who's stated goal is the destruction of an entire people who would kill you for simply existing in their society because of your behavior and beliefs. You are defending people who are literally like the people who perpetrated 9/11. These are the people who invented hijacking planes. 

> Israeli snipers shoot children, for fucks sake. 
No, they don't. Hamas snipers shoot palestinians and film it and publish it to convert the simple-minded young westerners to their cause through misguided pity.

> Israel steals land, steals homes,  

This is a point of contention. Israel was attacked from all sides by all of their neighbors and defeated them in a war. They conquered that land. It is Israel's property. 

They offered to give it to the Palestinian authority in exchange for recognition of Israel's right to exist and surrender of right to return in whole and allow it to become a nation.

The Palestinians refused that offer and prefered to go on fighting.

If you believe the land is stolen, then move. The land you live on is also stolen, and you are a hypocrite for asking others to surrender conquered land when you live on conquered land yourself. Which Indian tribe died so you could have a house in the suburbs? Which people migrating through Europe wiped out the natives who were there and took up residence?

You‚Äôre kidding right? Any ignorance at this point is wilful.

It wasn‚Äôt a surprise and they weren‚Äôt blindsided. 

They [knew](https://web.archive.org/web/20231201013804/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-attack-intelligence.html) Hamas‚Äô plans in great detail for more than a year beforehand.

When I say great detail, I mean they knew the attack would be heralded with a barrage of rockets.

They knew they‚Äôd use drones with incendiary payloads to take out automatic guns, communications and cameras along the border.

They knew they planned to cross into Israel on paragliders and motorcycles.

They knew they planned to take over kibbutzim. 

But they dismissed this intelligence because they didn‚Äôt believe Hamas had the capability to pull off such an audacious.

They then observed them training for all of the above things, and once again the dismissed it, believing the training to be purely performative.

Then only months prior to October 7th Shin Bet [warned](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj1mq6cwp) that a large scale attack was planned for the week after Yom Kippur, it was carried out exactly seven days after.",2024-05-03T15:31:25+00:00

Also which videos are you talking about ? I genuinely haven't seen them. But keep in mind Isreel would do anything to lie and direct the narrative according to their wishes and we've caught them red handed many times.

Also while I condemn the Hamas members who klled civilians I don't see any point in condemning Hamas, most of them seem to be only fighting fr freedom and not the dth of all Isreelis. Confirmed by their charter as well as their treatment of kidnapped Isreelis.

Again remember Isreel itself planted it's own men in Hamas and took 6 hours to response to the attack, plus Netanyahu also initially supported Hamas. Doesn't this ring a bell ?",2024-05-03T02:55:53+00:00
israelexposed,comment,l2i69rr,Shoddy-Operation4197,,"So just to be clear you support 75 years of ethnic cleansing, land dispossession, arbitrary arrest amounting to political prisoners/ hostages, arbitrary execution, literal genocide, apartheid and the list goes on and on. Like i said a ceasefire is still a state of war. And every Palestinian organization has tried to end it by agreeing to a peace which includes the establishment of a Palestinian state‚Ä¶ yes, even Hamas did it. In fact, just recently Hamas announced that should China be successful in reconciliation between Palestinian politicsl organizations it would be happy to integrate with other groups into one single government. Its the israelis that continually sabotage it. In fact, one message that has repeated by the foreign minister, the ambassador to the UK, and natenyahu himself is that they refuse to work for a Palestinian state. Literally every attack and rocket barrage committed by Hamas is an act of resistance against literal military occupation and siege which is in their right as an elected government. Just remember they called mandela a terrorist and he too used the exact same measures Hamas did. In fact, Palestine and South africa share one massive similarity which is when they tried to protest peacefully through the march of return in 2018 Palestinians were fired on and slaughtered by the Israelis. They literally dont have an option. Just like South Africans when they were slaughtered for attempting the thing. The result was armed resistance by mandelas forces just like Hamas. So yes, I do and no i do not condemn them. Moreover, the hannibal directive was utilized where tanks fired into homes in israeli kibbutzes indiscriminately killing everyone. In addition, they fired on their own civilians with attack helicopters indiscriminately as well. The number of dead was drastically reduced, the narratives published in media outlets were all slowly retracted as well including the stories on women being raped, women having babies cut out of their stomachs, and babies being slaughtered. The vast majority of those taken hostage are active military personnel. Hamas released hostages that were civilians including a mother and her child without negotiations. And all those who have been returned have stated they were treated well by Hamas before suddenly retracting their stories and spewing another narrative. That lack of consistency can only mean one thing which is that they received something in exchange for doing so. And indeed the one girl who did suddenly got a nose job right after. So do I support what happened? Yes I do. And taking a position to virtue signal someone else while not taking a position yourself is frankly a weak position to be in because not taking a side is complicity in the crimes being committed against the Palestinians.

I don't care what you believe in, I too think you are free to believe in whatever you want but you not realizing that religious structures among men are used to steer the masses, to create enemy images, fuel hate and abhorrance towards everything that is different then what 'your book' tells you and to separate the world in 'you and them' that is just sad.",2024-05-03T14:53:03+00:00

I am sorry if I come off as rude when I'm talking to you but although some massacres were done ""In the name"" of religion that doesn't mean that religion is bad or causes war or anything of the sort and the whole steering the mass thing has always been done one way or the other and I'm pretty sure you can find examples of this in history just because Religion was used to steer the mass a couple of times doesn't mean that it itself is inherently bad that just means that whoever steered the masses using it is bad

  
""According to one reputable source, only 7% of the 1763 recorded wars in history were fought on religious grounds (Encyclopedia of Wars).

* Even in ‚Äúreligious wars‚Äù, religion is often a cover for ethnic, social, economic, or other power struggles
* In comparison, Atheist leaders (Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Lenin, etc.) killed at least 110 million people (according to the BBC War Audit) in the 20th century alone, more than all religious wars in the previous 19 centuries combined. (Russell). All of these leaders were bent on the destruction of religion
* Yes, religion has been the direct cause of some wars. But so has economics, politics and geography. Are we ready to throw out these institutions simply because they've been misused?""

Why do they describe Israel killing dozens of Palestinians a ""Confrontation"" and hundreds of Palestinians a ""Skirmish"", but describe dozens of Israeli injuries a ""Terrorist attack"", dozens of Israeli deaths a ""Massacre"" and hundreds of Israeli deaths a ""Genocide""?

The language used to describe Palestinians by western media is so dehumanizing and biased, to mention nothing of dishonest and dangerous. The examples go on and on, and are used in every aspect of reporting when it comes to Gaza, Palestinians and Israelis.

Something not spoken about nearly enough is the Censorship Agreement we signed with them in 1966, and that has been in place since. Or the fact that they have an entire government censorship department, with a Chief Censor and a separate Chief Military Censor and hundreds of employees beneath them. Or the fact that they have hundreds of thousands paid and unpaid volunteers to censor, dox, suppress real news and promote fake news - 65,000 in CAMERA alone - but add in Jewish Internet Defense Force, Brand Israel, Yesha Council, Israel Sheli, Percepto, Iron Swords. Or the fact that they ask every single Jewish person in the world, the entirety of world Jewry, to participate in Hasbara - then deny that it exists while literally offering Hasbara fellowships and Wikipedia Editing Courses where they give prizes to the person with the most pro-Zionist edits.

Assuming Hazem is Muslim (based on him reciting the verse at the end 'Sufficient for us is Allah, and \[He is\] the best Disposer of affairs'), in Islam, having the status of a martyr is one of the greatest titles one can achieved, so him using that term is to honour their dead/killed.

Also, whoever doesn't understand what he means by martyr is honestly just stupid af or blinded by their racism.

He feared the consequences of this I somehow can see why.

Lately, I'm trying to think about what is happening with the police and universities crushing student encampments, and this might sound like a trope but a high majority of American Billionaires are Jews. Support for AIPAC and Israel in America is at its peak; there's a lot of jew money flowing, massive pressure and influence, even on the POTUS so much so that Biden's hand seems tied. Look Netanyahu sounds like POTUS and Blinken are beneath him when he's talking and making demands to Americans on TV. It's ridiculous. 

Jews might have successfully put America right on the palms of their hands. 

When I think about it more, maybe Epstein was a plant in a jewish long game. He played the politicians, the most influential personalities. The Zionists have extremely intelligent people and they could have planned this dark manipulation for a long game. I know this sounds crazy but there could be truth to this. 

Also, listen to an hour long interview of Prof Richard Wolff on Dialogue Works channel on YouTube. He talked about Zionists Jews threatening to bring the world down with them if things don't work out for Israel. It's an impending doom that the world is facing if America doesn't take Israel out of the equation as early as now, but is it possible? I can't say anymore.",2024-05-03T14:37:02+00:00

israelexposed,comment,l2dd9b9,israelexposed-ModTeam,,"The letter written by Albert Einstein is referring to his criticism of the Irgun and the Stern Gang (Lehi), whom were labeled as terrorist organizations due to their methods.

Irgun and Stern Gang: These were Zionist that used violent tactics to oppose British rule and Arab resistance. Both groups are known for their attacks on Arab and British targets. Notably, the Irgun, under the leadership of Menachem Begin, was responsible for the bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem in 1946, which killed 91 people. The Stern Gang also engaged in assassination campaigns and other violent acts.
  
Albert Einstein was a supporter of Palestine, advocating for peaceful coexistence between Jews and Arabs. 

In 1948, following the Deir Yassin massacre, where over 100 Palestinian villagers were massacred by Irguns alongside members of the Lehi group, Einstein co-signed a letter to the New York Times, denouncing Menachem Begin's visit to the United States and condemning his party, Herut. The letter described Begin's party as closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy, and social appeal to the Nazi and Fascist parties. It specifically called out the tactics used by these groups as terrorist.

Einstein‚Äôs stance reflects his deep concern over the use of violence in politics and his fear that the emerging Israeli state might adopt a character counter to the ideals he believed were essential for peace and justice.",2024-05-03T08:44:42+00:00

israelexposed,comment,l27oeb5,isawasin,,"Only 8 countries have officially and individually designated hamas a terrorist organisation. That number goes up significantly with the addition of the EU. But that's it. [The UN doesn't designate them as such either.](https://youtu.be/4RLMtFqZFdc?si=2Bj3e6EDp3e6FkWD) You can jump to 2:40 for the statement that's relevant, but the whole interview is worth a watch or listen. 

Speaking in terms of pluralities, the whole world certainly was shocked by the events of Oct 7. There's little doubt at all that serious crimes were committed despite an absurd list of lies running through the Israeli narrative of events. 

But it's simply not true (as much as it's presented as such) that the overwhelming majority of the global community, as individual states and as individual world citizens, aren't cognizant of the hard truth. A truth some people will never accept:

The basic (and thankfully increasingly transparent) colonial double standard of the Israel Palestine ""conflict"" is that any Palestinian violence justifies any Israeli violence, but no
Israeli violence ever justifies any Palestinian violence, and once you see it, you'll never stop seeing it.

Hamas are a terrorist group the same way the ANC were, and the FLN, Viet Cong etc.

Depending on when you start the clock, apartheid South Africa lasted anywhere from close to half to almost the entirety of the 20th century. I personally consider the latter to be as accurate as the former because, regardless, it was an unbroken continuation of prior centuries of colonialism and imperialism. There was nothing ideologically separating it from the
Trans-Atlantic slave trade. From the Belgian Congo, from British concentration camps (arguably the first in the worid) in Kenya, from the brutality of France Afrique, from the first genocide of the 20th century in Namibia. But of itself, it lasted almost a century. Most of that century, this state that today is regarded as a stain on history enjoyed perfect, unblemished respectability. The USA, Canada, all of Europe supported her and her defence against the resistance that existed from apartheids's inception.

No one today but an inveterate racist would argue that Nelson Mandela and the ANC deserved the libellous slander of ""terrorist, nor the FLN in their contribution to the fight against France in the Algerian war of independence. Resistance to such racism and injustice (up to and including armed struggle) are entirely vindicated by history. Those two struggles are regarded as two of the most significant wars for liberation in modern history. Yet for almost a century, those brave people were first regarded and described by civilised people and in their civilised newspapers as savages and then, as the language of oppression evolved, terrorists.

Does hamas employ terrorism: The use of violence or the threat of violence, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political goals? Yes, sometimes. So, aren't they terrorists? Here we come to the problem. Why doesn't the UN regard hamas as a terrorist organisation? Terrorist is being used as a Hollywood term. We're being asked to accept it as shorthand for: these are monsters incapable of sincere agency and reasoned reasoned thought. Sadistic to a degree that it would be offensive to even try to empathise with them as human beings.

Doesn't the Israeli state employ terrorism: The practise of coercion to achieve political demands by committing violence on civilian targets? A mode of government by terror or intimidation?

Hamas are a political movement and one of many resistance groups within the broader movement for Palestinian liberation. Right now they are the main material force for Palestinian resistance. I don't want them to be, but I want there to be no need for them. They're a perfectly reasonable response to a brutal injustice to which the global community has proven, unable, or unwilling to address. Fom one side Oct 7th is called Israel's 9/11. I call it a Palestinian Warsaw Uprising. 

Every few years, Hollywood will churn out a film or a series of films that play out a very broadly American fantasy. But in a more specific sense a very white post-colonial fantasy. Star Wars, The Hunger Games, Red Dawn, Battle of Los Angeles. It doesn't really matter who the enemy are, communists, debaucherist elites, aliens even. The overall question each time allows people to entertain the fantasy of what they would like to think they'd do if they were oppressed. If they were invaded and occupied. You know these films: You are the underdog. Your back's against the wall. No one is coming to save you. It's just you and others in the same situation, everyone you love, everything you hold dear, you are watching being stripped away. You'll probably be killed anyway, and everyone you love. So what will you do? Will you fight? The heroes do, and no one calls them terrorists.",2024-05-02T07:18:41+00:00

The IDF conducted an investigation and found it's forces were not present, that ambulances didn't require permission, and they had no knowledge of anything to do with this.  Washing Post confirmed IDF forces were present and the damage was from Israeli weapon systems.

The USA started trying that approach in Vietnam, but when the public heard about My Lai and a few others, they were disgusted and it had a lot to do with making the US government pull out.

But it isn't that way for Israel. there is nowhere else in the world they can go. They have no choice but to win or die, because no other nation will take them. Everywhere in the world there is so much irrational anti-semitism that they can't leave. 

I read that somebody asked a Nazi general how he felt about killing jewish 5-year-olds and babies. lHe explained that if they grew up they would try to take revenge for what the Nazis did to their parents. So letting them live was storing up trouble. It was necessary to kill them all so they wouldn't fight back 20 years later. He was right. And it's exactly the same for Israel. Exactly the same. 

Except that the Nazis declared war on the USA and we fought them. The Israelis use the USA as their only ally. What happens if soft-hearted Americans get upset about Israeli mass killing? Maybe they can get by without US support, but can they get by with US opposition? 

Maybe it won't come to that. Maybe enough Americans will realize that Israel has no choice but to do genocide, just as the Nazis had no choice. They need lebensraum.

I note one of the stories on the front page of that site suggests Hamas is involved in stealing aid intended for Palestinians. I have no idea of the veracity of that account, but it perhaps reveals the simple truth that Palestinians are not of a single view as to how to survive the genocide, or whether they should fight back against their oppressors.

No I agree, which is why I'm confused you're making it complicated.

>if you are debating with me on whether the christians and Muslims citizens have equal rights as Jews in Israel, why don‚Äôt you read the fucking law

I have. It's clear to me that you haven't.

>‚ÄúThe Irish‚Äù in their constitution does not describe one ethnic group or religion and leave out ALL of the others, it is all Irish citizens, regardless of race or religion. See the difference?

Wrong. The Irish constitution, like constitutions of all nation states, makes a distinction between the Irish nation and Ireland as a country. Similarly, the Jewish nation and Jewish country (Israel) are different concepts. The right of self determination is the exclusive right of the former in the latter. The fact that the Jewish people only follow one religion is irrelevant. Most Jews in Israel are completely irreligious. By the way, Protestantism is about as ubiquitous among the Irish people as Judaism is among the Jewish people. Christianity - even moreso.

>The Irish didn‚Äôt move to fucking Ireland and murder and displace 700k people out into the desert. 

Neither did the Jews (not that this has anything to do with the discussion we're having).

>The Irish don‚Äôt have one fifth of their citizens who are not Irish. 

Ireland, like Israel, has plenty of non-Irish citizens of Ireland. Again - you're conflating the concepts of a People/nation with a state. Ireland is perfectly capable of making this distinction, you aren't.


>The Irish don‚Äôt have Irish citizens who are not allowed to vote. 

Nor does Israel.

>The Irish are not imposing an apartheid on another people. 

Neither is Israel. (Again - not that this has anything to do with the discussion).",2024-05-01T12:46:47+00:00

Is it true? my first comment was that if true, this is a massive bombshell of a news piece. It's beyond bizarre that the reporter doesn't follow up on this, asking for sources etc.. Did he receive the offer personally from Hamas? How did he contact Hamas? we know today only the in-gaza leadership gets to sign up on deals, were they reachable in the first 48hrs? we know Hamas isn't the only organization to kidnap Israelis, some were even kidnapped by Gazan's who aren't closely aligned to any group, how would they have been able to collaborate so quickly?

In short, sounds like crock at worst, poor journalism at best for not following up.

You can pick apart any religion and find some really fucked up stuff. The Bible is full of verses excusing things like slavery, rape and murder. And you really don't need to know very much about the situation in Gaza to be appalled. The more you learn the worse it gets but even a cursory understanding is enough to make you enraged. Just because there is a long history does not mean that it is complicated. It is pretty simple if you're not a Zionist.

I get what you're saying about the input-output and it is a big part of the reason that I believe there is no other population that projects harder than Zionists. They constantly claim that Palestinians are indoctrinated into hating Israelis.

Here‚Äôs is all 10 steps of genocide with sources of them being committed ,"Classification ‚Äì The differences between people are not respected. There‚Äôs a division of ‚Äòus‚Äô and ‚Äòthem‚Äô which can be carried out using stereotypes, or excluding people who are perceived to be different.

https://m.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/the-second-intifada-a-defining-event-that-reshaped-the-nation-642644

Symbolisation ‚Äì This is a visual manifestation of hatred. Jews in Nazi Europe were forced to wear yellow stars to show that they were ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô.

https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2017/11/18/the-colour-coded-israeli-id-system-for-palestinians

Discrimination ‚Äì The dominant group denies civil rights or even citizenship to identified groups. The 1935 Nuremberg Laws stripped Jews of their German citizenship, made it illegal for them to do many jobs or to marry German non-Jews.

Dehumanisation ‚Äì Those perceived as ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô are treated with no form of human rights or personal dignity. During the Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as ‚Äòcockroaches‚Äô; the Nazis referred to Jews as ‚Äòvermin‚Äô.

https://theintercept.com/2024/02/07/gaza-israel-netanyahu-propaganda-lies-palestinians/

Organisation ‚Äì Genocides are always planned. Regimes of hatred often train those who go on to carry out the destruction of a people.

◊ê◊™""◊¶https://www.idf.il ‚Ä∫ ... ‚Ä∫ Mini SitesTraining and Preparation

Polarisation ‚Äì Propaganda begins to be spread by hate groups. The Nazis used the newspaper Der St√ºrmer to spread and incite messages of hate about Jewish people.


https://theintercept.com/2024/02/07/gaza-israel-netanyahu-propaganda-lies-palestinians/


Preparation ‚Äì Perpetrators plan the genocide. They often use euphemisms such as the Nazis‚Äô phrase ‚ÄòThe Final Solution‚Äô to cloak their intentions. They create fear of the victim group, building up armies and weapons.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip_(2023%E2%80%93present)

Persecution ‚Äì Victims are identified because of their ethnicity or religion and death lists are drawn up. People are sometimes segregated into ghettos, deported or starved and property is often expropriated. Genocidal massacres begin.

I am not affiliated with the other Qanon, although I know who it and they are. You could say they were my rivals and this is who I am exposing. I am here to tell the truth about the people that were behind Qanon.

This is too much to share at once, you'll later begin to see why, but I want to start sharing this all with you today to start crossing off my to-do list.

There is a cult that has been behind much of our terrorist attacks and assassinations. What I will be sharing is self-evident, you can draw your own conclusions.

# Ma'ale Akrabim Massacre

Why I am sharing this:

Pay close attention to the date (17 March 1954) while also paying attention to the coordinates and the elements Chlorine and Ytterbium.

Now look at this periodic table from 1954:



https://preview.redd.it/qizur0ro3fxc1.png?width=2318&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1503aa658017ef2e866efd2d5faebd3ab6ce43b

(from https://www.meta-synthesis.com/webbook/35\_pt/pt\_database.php?yearfield=1954 )

The eighth group of elements tells you all that you need to know.

Let‚Äôs call this a ‚ÄúPeriodic Table Killer Column Attack‚Äù (PTK-CA). This is extremely helpful for understanding the logic behind the Las Vegas Shooting that will be covered in my next posts (for the curious, the Arsenic column will tell you all you need to know).

Firstly, to assess whether a terror attack was orchestrated by the PTK you would sort of trial and error using the numbers seen in the dates and the coordinates. The date is always a good place to start.

In this case, somebody might begin by checking what 17 corresponds to on the periodic table since the attack happened on the 17th of March. They would discover that the 17th element is Chlorine that has an atomic weight of 35.45. You look at the coordinates and it says 30¬∞54‚Ä≤24‚Ä≥N¬†35¬∞07‚Ä≤53‚Ä≥E. It‚Äôs a decent start.

You notice the number ‚Äò07‚Äô and out of curiosity, check the element that corresponds to 70 and discover that Ytterbium has the atomic weight of 173.054.

This is the point you begin to see that this attack was planned ahead to happen at precisely this point of time. There is no other way to explain it. The attack happened on 17th of March, 1954 ie 17/3/54. Somehow, Ytterbium provides the date of the attack and the very first four digits of the longitude coordinate while the second does have a ‚Äò70‚Äô in it although backwards. You begin to wonder if the 35 and 53 were chosen for Chlorine‚Äôs atomic weight of 35.

Who knows what their reasoning is - I am only trying to reverse engineer it 70 years later but I can tell you that all the numbers used in this crime match up perfectly with the Chlorine column as seen again on this 1954 periodic table

The eight group of elements contains the elements 9, 17, 35, 53, 85 on the right side of the column with a 70 underneath it. On the modern periodic table, you do see how Ytterbium is directly underneath Chlorine.

Chlorine also times the attack perfectly just like Ytterbium now that you think about it - it‚Äôs the 17th element and the weight is 35.45. If you are to combine the numbers, you‚Äôd have 1735.45 which again provides the date of the attack - 17th of March, 1954.

To be honest, I haven‚Äôt even figured out how Bromine, Iodine or Astatine fit into the picture yet because Chlorine and Ytterbium were enough to tell me all that I need to know and I‚Äôve got many more crimes just like this one that need to be solved.

Incase it doesn‚Äôt go without saying - the odds of a terror attack happening on the 17th of March 1954 matching these coordinates are‚Ä¶. Just statistically impossible without the orchestrators having planned it far ahead of time, and confirms that this wasn‚Äôt done by no ordinary person. Later, I‚Äôll begin to explain the psychological profile of a narcissistic, sociopathic or psychopathic sadist and the combination of the types of control freakery, perfectionism and obsession to detail that occurs in these serial killing terrorists.

2) Do you think a dock is all you need to get goods from the sea into a country? Or is it possible that this will be used as a logistical hub for aid to be distributed more widely?

It is currently unclear why the social media platform, owned by Elon Musk, banned Zwelivelile Mandla Mandela, a member of the National Assembly of South Africa. The company has issued no statement regarding its decision to restrict the South African politician‚Äôs speech, but the timing is questionable.

Mandela has spent the last week making multiple public appearances in support of Palestinian liberation, quoting his grandfather ahead of his voyage aboard a Freedom Flotilla trip sailing to Gaza from Turkey with the intention to provide more than 5,000 tons of aid to the war-torn enclave.

‚ÄúHe regarded the Palestinian struggle as the greatest moral issue of our time,‚Äù Mandela said in a speech posted on social media Friday, referring to his grandfather while donning a keffiyeh. ‚ÄúHe made a commitment to the Palestinian people by saying that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinian people.‚Äù",2024-04-29T00:46:18+00:00

Jewish citizens are transferred to Israeli civilian courts; Arab citizens are not. They face a military tribunal court with a conviction rate of over 99%. One reason why the source was so good was it mention that in theory Palestinian citizens of Israel could be transferred but they couldn't find any successful request for such a transfer.

It is not difficult to make the case that Israel‚Äôs actions in the West Bank amount to apartheid. Israelis and Palestinians in the same territory are subject to two different legal systems. They are tried in different courts, one military, one civilian, for the same crime committed on the same street. Jews in the West Bank, both Israeli citizens and non-citizens who are eligible as Jews to immigrate, enjoy most of the same rights and protections as Israelis in the rest of the country. Palestinians are subject to military rule and are denied freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, freedom of movement and even the right not to be detained indefinitely without trial. **The discrimination is not just national ‚Äì by Israelis against Palestinians who lack citizenship ‚Äì but ethnic**, by Jews against Palestinian subjects and citizens alike. While Jews in the West Bank, citizens or not, are tried in Israeli civil courts, Israeli citizens who are Palestinian can be sent to military courts. **A 2014 report by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, the largest and oldest human rights group in the country, noted that ‚Äòsince the 1980s, all Israeli citizens brought to trial before the military courts were Arab citizens or residents of Israel ... no judgment was found in which the request of an Arab citizen to transfer his case from a military court to a court in Israel was accepted.‚Äô**",2024-04-28T22:33:51+00:00

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

The Israel bloc was probably some kind of counter-protest. The police kept the two groups very well apart, so it was hard to see the pro-Israel numbers unless one happened to be on that side of the cordon anyway.

israelexposed,post,1cew0pc,Academic-Waltz-3116,"Operation Olive Branch, Israeli/Fed Operation, Scam or Both?","So I keep seeing campaigns from this organization Operation Olive Branch and its supporters on social media, most notably Tik Tok. Organization claims to be a grassroots, manages a spreadsheet of GoFundMe's for Palestinians trying to leave Gaza. They also have another fund directed to a Perinatal Project. Seems good on its face, right?

From what I can tell the organization wasn't created until February, which is when International Israel friendly publications aka most Western Media began running stories about large sums being sought by Gazans:

https://www.thedailybeast.com/desperate-palestinians-set-up-gofundmes-to-pay-huge-bribes-to-escape-gaza

GoFundMe uses PayPal to pay out, and PayPal does not serve Palestine, this organization directs people to directly contact who they say are families and coordinate payments to others outside of Palestine to arrange them leaving.

I've seen this organization for weeks now pressure, bully, and make underhanded and more overt violent threats to creators to share their cause. It strikes me as very concerning because paying Gazans to leave Gaza falls right in line with the far right Jewish Party of Israel's rhetoric and plans. There is no right of return established for these people, if they indeed are all receiving the funds in the first place. Antony Blinken rejected this idea from Ben-Gvir earlier this year:

https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2017-09-07/ty-article/israeli-right-wing-party-wants-to-pay-palestinians-to-leave-israel/0000017f-db41-d3a5-af7f-fbef484d0000

https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/17/middleeast/israel-far-right-gaza-settler-movement-cmd-intl/index.html

Given the history of the Holy Land Five, this feels like a setup to entrap leftists in a scheme that would qualify them as providing aid to a terrorist organization in the United States. This event was notable as an Israeli official was able to testify anonymously, the first and only time in US history this has happened. Their testimony that they could ""smell Hamas"" put aid organizers with no ties to Hamas in prison for up to 65 years. They also used this as justification to secretly monitor the individuals for years through the FBI:

https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/03/11/after-israels-designation-human-rights-groups-terrorists-biden-should-release

Is this a big Zionist plot to Jan 6 style entrap Leftists in the US and/or ethnically clensed the Gaza Strip in line with the far right in Israel? Why do they tolerate bullying, harassment and inciting violence in their organization to spread their message? The group seems to be started by a white Jewish woman which has obvious implications given the nature of a Jewish state ethnically cleansing Palestinians. Are they praying on compassionate leftist activists to achieve their goals as well as blacklist them for intelligence operations in the future? Personally, I smell Feds.

israelexposed,post,1ceqife,Helpful-Antelope-678,"I watched Sheryl Sandberg's documentary ""Screams Before Silence""...","Weird movie. It essentially argue the old ""Hamas using sexual assault as a weapon"" argument. I have a bit of a bias but here's some sketchy things I've noticed while watching this thing

1. None of the released Israeli hostages confirmed that they were raped. They interviewed two female hostages who both complained of sexual advances and groping (which of course is deplorable). The second one, Amit Soussana, heavily implied that she was raped. I believe she almost certainly was and whoever did it deserves to be tried for war crimes, however this still doesn't prove the claim of ""rape being used as a tool for war"".
2. All of the really graphic claims were second-hand from Israeli attorneys or IDF/ZAKA members, including Raz Cohen (who was the main witness behind the NY Times story). Cohen has changed his story a few times over the few months, from ""i only heard and didn't see any SA"" to ""they were engaging in necrophilia and I saw it with my own eyes"".
3. They had these weird interrogation footage of this guy Zahdy Ali Zahdy Shahin who, in a clip with heavily distorted audio, ""admitted to raping someone"". It's extra bizarre because that interrogation clip already made headlines in January (http://tiny.cc/zolvxz) about him ""confirming the use of human shields"". Why would this additional information not have been public then?
4. The purposeful excluding of videos or images was done ""out of respect to the victims families"" was a convenient way of leaving out any hard proof. Also they blurred the image of Shani Louk implying that she was raped, despite the actual video (http://tiny.cc/yolvxz) not giving any indication of rape and shows her fully clothed with a gunshot would to the head. Pretty disrespectful to her family to broadcast that kind of thing to the world imo.

Ultimately I believe this documentary to be hasbara because it doesn't ONCE CALL FOR A CEASEFIRE. Idk a lot about Sheryl Sandberg but it seems like she might be using the very real atrocities of October 7th to push Israeli propaganda and continue justifying the genocide. That being said, a personal weakness of mine was/is my inability to properly empathize with the victims of October 7th. It's hard for me to feel bad for settlers in a violent apartheid state but I do want to say that **they are just regular people in their homes and that they didn't deserve to die/be kidnapped/assaulted.** The movie did make me feel more empathy for the victims which I think is a good thing. Still, since it really appears to be isolated instances of sexual assault, as opposed to a full on ""rape as a tool of war"" situation, I can't bring myself to ""condemn Hamas"" for October 7th. They've been living in an open air prison for 20 years and are justified in fighting back against Israel.",2024-04-27T22:14:07+00:00

Electronic Intifada has debunked claims in both the NYT of the same title & the doc.  They make many of the same points you did. Link is to their episode debunking the ‚Äúdocumentary‚Äù hasbara film.

https://youtu.be/TApiok-KiRc?si=Keq6kMlquPdtq2Td

I‚Äôve saved a couple videos of women that said on Oct 7 Hamas invaders told them to cover themselves.  When Amit Soussana‚Äôs first account of SA came out, I was certain that I‚Äôd seen an interview in which she talked about them repeatedly trying to cover her w a white sheet during her kidnapping (the video filmed a distance away, as she fights captors that are bringing her across a wide field, in some versions it‚Äôs obvious they continually tried to wrap a sheet around her shoulders, as she appears to be wearing a tank top).  But, I‚Äôve been unable to find that interview again so far.  

In articles, Amit Soussana talks about being repeatedly questioned about her period & that eventually she was forced to perform a sexual act on her captor, Mohammed. She also says she was eventually taken to a different location in the tunnels underground & guarded by Hamas fighters.  Imho this is not evidence for systemic sexual abuse by Hamas.  Also, a lot of random Gazan opportunists crossed the fence after Hamas broke through, some kidnapped Israelis to sell to Hamas.  

I recall a ZAKA (no credibility left) rep or some staff member claiming they were too overwhelmed with bodies to document evidence of SAs.  I don‚Äôt know if they received assistance from outside agencies but, I know assistance was available.  I don‚Äôt believe for a millisecond that Israel would not do rape kits during autopsies, that they wouldn‚Äôt collect DNA for evidence to prosecute SA crimes. 

October 7 was tragic on the facts alone.  So, why such lies & embellishments?  We know why.  Ironically, it‚Äôs their many lies & embellishments (40 beheaded babies, et al) that made many search for truth & discover Israel‚Äôs long history of violent oppression.  

I can bring myself to condemn Oct 7.  But, I also see it as a natural outcome of generations of cruel oppression.  Also, imho Hamas didn‚Äôt expect they‚Äôd be able to kill & kidnap as many as they did.  

When Netanyahu released 1027 Palestinian prisoners (including Yahya Sinwar, Hamas leader, serving 4 life sentences & about 280 others serving life sentences) in exchange for ONE IDF soldier, Gilad Shalit, he encouraged further kidnappings.  His twisted, immoral belief that one Israeli life is worth 1000 Palestinian lives really backfired.  Netanyahu has ruined Israel & is a habitual liar.  

Props to you for viewing Israeli sources!  Times of Israel, Haaretz & Jerusalem Post are my go tos.  

Everyone interested in this ‚Äúconflict‚Äù should see this Four Corners doc, Israeli & Hamas officials interviewed, including the founder of Breaking the Silence, former PM Ehud Barak, etc.

israelexposed,post,1cefvtw,Helpful-Antelope-678,How positive of an impact would Arab States granting citizenship to Palestinians make?,"It seems like neighboring states (with the exception of Jordan) all essentially refuse to give Palestinian refugees citizenship. I understand part of the reasoning to be ""well if we take them in then they're giving up on the right-of-return"". I empathize with that position because I'm a strong believer in the right-of-return however, I would imagine a significant chunk of Palestinian diaspora (not born in Palestine) would just like citizenship wherever they were born.

If neighboring countries were more permissive of giving citizenship to Palestinians, would this improve the situation as far as the grand-scheme of Palestinian well-being. My hypothetical compromise would maybe be:

100,000 Palestinians are allowed to return to Israel and the Israeli government must pay reparations to Palestinians in other countries who are not permitted to return. Additionally Israel must significantly halt (or downright terminate) it's Aliyah program which unfairly allows anyone of Jewish decent to become Israeli citizens. 

I know it's impossible that Israel would agree to anything like that but what are your thoughts? At what extent should the Palestinians compromise on the right-of-return?",2024-04-27T14:32:19+00:00

If jews have the right to move a nation based on religion and occupy land without having any ties to the country, Palestinians have a right to return to their occupied lands. Where they have been living for centuries. Unlike the zionists. And there can be no limit to the number of Palestinians.

This should be an entirely unacceptable position to any principled antifascists and antiracist, which we expect all antizionists to be.

 Ive lived in 4 different states since about 2016. What do u think the odds r of all the cities in all those states being absolute shit hole liberal cesspools with staggering homeless population and drug use? And what r the odds that all of a sudden somehow when u get 15 or 20 minutes outside the cities, u deal with people who respect and take care of eachother, other peoples property and their way of life?

You can make your first choice a third party candidate, and if enough people vote for that third party (over 50%) they win. But that candidate had only say 3% of the total vote they would exclude it and move onto the next preference.

So as an example, in preferential voting you could vote for Bernie and put Biden as a second choice.

Following 1948, when the UN (with Truman leading the effort) created Israel and stole the Palestinian's home, the US had some benefit from Israel as an ally. We were scared of communism spreading in the Middle East, and we needed a stronghold ally for oil.  

But we don't get any benefit from Israel anymore. With the advent of fracking for oil, we create our own nowadays, and the spread of communism isn't an issue anymore. 

Our politicians can't piss off Israelis and Jewish people in the US, though. They need the votes and the money.  So, there is some logic in removing the Israeli influence from the US. But, it sounds bigoted and terrible.  

I get the logic, though. 

A better immediate solution is we must stop giving money and weapons to Israel. Period. Not one cent. Not ""until they stop killing Palestinians."" Just no more aid. Money would be better spent here or rebuilding Gaza, which is the least we can do.

Social media platforms, per this ranking (good as any), 1-4 were made and ran by American companies. By enacting this law, it means that the government is effectively trying to force the world's 5th largest social media platform to also come under the control of the American government. In an ironic twist, while they can't prove the CCP is using TikTok to spy on American citizens (they probably are), we sure as hell can prove the American government uses American based social media companies to spy on Americans. They even openly sell the data. Yet they claim this in the name of protecting American citizens.

In our modern age, if you control social media you can control the narrative. It is an enormous consolidation of power. I am a bit taken aback because every article I can find just says ""sell to a non-Chinese company"" prior to the ruling, but after the fact the sources I can find specifically mentions it has to have new American owners.

Referencing what I heard in a NPR segment, this is quite literally the American government saying, ""give us control over the content 1.5+ billion people see, or you will lose access to our 170 million domestic users"".

Depending on when you start the clock, apartheid South Africa lasted anywhere from close to half to almost the entirety of the 20th century. I personally consider the latter to be as accurate as the former because, regardless, it was an unbroken continuation of prior centuries of colonialism and imperialism. There was nothing ideologically separating it from the
Trans-Atlantic slave trade. From the Belgian Congo, from British concentration camps (arguably the first in the worid) in Kenya, from the brutality of France Afrique, from the first genocide of the 20th century in Namibia. But of itself, it lasted almost a century. Most of that century, this state that today is regarded as a stain on history enjoyed perfect, unblemished respectability. It seemed immutable. It doesn't exist anymore. There's nothing stable about apartheid. There's nothing stable about colonialism. There's nothing stable about injustice. Solidarity ‚úåüèº",2024-04-25T10:34:55+00:00

The Slow Unveiling of the Palestinian Nakba

It is a damning indictment of the international community that the true scale and lasting impact of the Nakba, the catastrophic dispossession of the Palestinian people, remained obscured and marginalized for so long.



It took decades ‚Äî nearly half a century ‚Äî before the term ‚ÄúNakba‚Äù gained widespread recognition and the events of 1948 were understood as an ongoing process of violence and displacement, rather than a singular historical event.



The reasons for this protracted obscuring of the Nakba are manifold, and speak to the power of nationalist mythmaking and the complicity of those who would rather look away from uncomfortable truths.



In the immediate aftermath of 1948, the world was preoccupied with the creation of the state of Israel, hailing it as a just response to the horrors of the Holocaust. The plight of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians violently expelled from their homes was, at best, an afterthought ‚Äî at worst, actively ignored or denied.



Even among Palestinians themselves, the term ‚ÄúNakba‚Äù was slow to gain traction as a unifying political concept. As the search results note, it was not until the end of the 1980s that the Nakba narrative began to coalesce, with the ‚Äúongoing Nakba‚Äù framework emerging only in the 2000s. This delay speaks to the immense trauma and fragmentation inflicted upon the Palestinian people, who were scattered and silenced, their very identity as a nation under assault.

Why Did it Take So Long?

First Intifada (1987‚Äì1993): The First Intifada, also known as the ‚ÄúUprising,‚Äù began in December 1987 in the occupied Palestinian territories. It was a grassroots movement of civil disobedience, protests, and resistance against Israeli occupation. The Intifada highlighted the ongoing Palestinian struggle and drew international attention to the Nakba and its consequences.

Media Coverage and International Awareness: During the 1980s, media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict increased significantly. Journalists reported on the harsh conditions faced by Palestinians living under occupation, including home demolitions, land confiscations, and human rights abuses. This coverage helped raise awareness about the Nakba and its ongoing impact.

Scholarly Research and Documentation: Scholars and historians delved deeper into the Nakba during the 1980s. They conducted research, collected oral histories, and documented the experiences of Palestinian refugees. Their work shed light on the scale of displacement, loss of homes, and trauma suffered by Palestinian families.

International Solidarity Movements: Activists around the world organized solidarity movements in support of Palestinian rights. These movements advocated for justice, recognition of the Nakba, and the right of return for Palestinian refugees. The 1980s saw increased global awareness and activism related to the Palestinian cause.

United Nations Resolutions: The United Nations continued to address the Palestinian issue during the 1980s. Resolutions reaffirmed the rights of Palestinian refugees and called for a just resolution to the conflict. These resolutions emphasized the importance of acknowledging historical injustices, including the Nakba",2024-04-24T13:41:24+00:00

Cowardice and Hypocrisy at Columbia

The administration at Columbia University has once again demonstrated its craven capitulation to the forces of intolerance and oppression. As pro-Palestinian protesters on campus have been met with arrests and accusations of threatening Jewish students, the two individuals who allegedly assaulted these protesters with a noxious chemical weapon have faced no meaningful consequences.



Let us be clear ‚Äî the use of ‚Äúskunk water‚Äù, a foul-smelling liquid developed by the Israeli military as a crowd control tactic, against peaceful demonstrators is an abhorrent act of violence. This chemical agent, which causes nausea, burning eyes, and other distressing symptoms, has been widely condemned as a form of collective punishment used by the Israeli occupation forces against Palestinian civilians.



Yet at Columbia, where administrators were all too eager to crack down on student groups like Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace for the supposed crime of voicing criticism of Israel‚Äôs actions, the perpetrators of this chemical attack have faced no such repercussions. Instead, the university has taken the cowardly path of simply banning the alleged assailants from campus, without even the basic step of handing them over to law enforcement for a proper investigation.



This is the height of hypocrisy. Columbia claims to uphold the values of free speech and academic freedom, yet it has repeatedly shown that these principles only apply when the views expressed align with the pro-Israel orthodoxy favored by the university‚Äôs wealthy donors. The suspension of SJP and JVP, and the failure to swiftly and forcefully condemn the skunk water attack, make a mockery of these lofty ideals.",2024-04-23T22:03:30+00:00

israelexposed,comment,l0z1c7k,Tyrant-Goldfish,,"Renouncing their faith? A lot of people ethnically identified as Jewish are atheists. It‚Äôs weird but they exist. Anyway, talking about religion, we see Netanyahu quoting the Bible saying ‚Äòremember what Amalek has done to you.‚Äô He‚Äôs basically using religion for control. Riling up the army to go kill ‚ÄúAmalekites‚Äù in Gaza. So it‚Äôs okay for them to kill civilians including children because the Bible says so. 

If you ask any religious Jews who are against the war and the actions of the Israeli government they will agree that Israel‚Äôs action is against the Ten Commandments. That‚Äôs what the ‚ÄòNOT IN OUR NAME‚Äô signs are for. Back then the Muslims were holding up that sign in marches and protests against ISIS. They say extremism have no religion. Same thing is happening right now. Religion is being used to justify one‚Äôs actions. 

When you look at the Palestinians who are suffering, the muslim Palestinians hold on to the verse in the Quran that says ‚ÄòAllah is with those that are patient‚Ä¶‚Äô so they understand that all this happening is a heavy heavy test for them. 

And both the muslims and Christians in Gaza equate their suffering to the suffering of Job, the gentile prophet in the Bible and Quran. Job remains devout even tho everything stripped away from him. His wealth taken away, his children died, his physical health‚Ä¶ 

Despite what‚Äôs happening to him, he didn‚Äôt curse God. So that‚Äôs why you see Palestinians who lost the people they love in front of them and watching their homes blown into tiny pieces and rubble still praising God and still praying to God despite all of that. It‚Äôs heavy and traumatizing but they persevere because they believe in what their holy book says. So being understanding and uncomplaining towards the challenges from God, you will be rewarded in the afterlife.

So, basically every religion is a cult. If it‚Äôs for good and makes them feel better about certain things then that‚Äôs fine. As a non-religious person it‚Äôs important to understand other people‚Äôs perspectives on their faith before jumping into conclusions. 

There are muslims who would kill their own family members if they renounce Islam. And that‚Äôs a problem. But look at what the Quran says. ‚ÄòThere can be no compulsion in faith.‚Äô So the problem is the people twisting the meaning or maybe misunderstood the message or having their own agendas or whatever. That‚Äôs why I stay away from those kind of people. And away from being a fanatic. The religious far right Israelis that are currently controlling the Israeli government are indeed extremists like ISIS.

I grew up in a Trinitarian Christian church/family, lost faith & became atheist, then agnostic as I was ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù & dabbled in learning about new age then paganism (never felt paganism was right tho because it logically doesn‚Äôt make sense to define God as all powerful & creator of all but then have a power struggle of creation/creator complex with multiple ‚Äúgods‚Äù) & then I looked into Islam & alhamdulilla I realized I was a Muslim all along‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt ever feel I was praying to Jesus PBUH, I always saw him as a prophet & the trinity never checked out logically‚Ä¶ I debated with my father, we still do a bit & I realized that as logically as he likes to be perceived, when attempting to iron out the logic with him, I realized how much his religion was based on faith alone &‚Ä¶ well that is his choice but I like my religion to be grounded in logic & ‚Äòthen‚Äô put my full faith into it; I understand there are things that are ‚Äúbecause God is the most wise, allahu allum,‚Äù but I usually find that when I put my faith in first (& these are usually small things, not something that‚Äôs heaven-hell sort of thing) then I find the wisdom in having the patience to see the fruits of the faith.

I feel like especially in the west there is a strong Christianity to atheism pipeline & then people think Islam is basically a copy of Christianity so it‚Äôs not worth looking into‚Ä¶ but 2 things‚Ä¶ 1) If Islam was a copy of Christianity, why doesn‚Äôt the Quran copy the errors/contradiction of the Bible? & 2) I understand the 3-in-1 god, trinity, doesn‚Äôt make sense, in Islam we do not divide nor multiply the creator which means we believe in complete oneness, complete self sufficiency of God‚Ä¶ actually it can be said in surah Al Ikhlas in the Quran (translated & paraphrased), ‚Äúsay Allah (God in Arabic which cannot be plural like the word ‚Äúgods‚Äù) the One, the self sufficient, is not born nor has children, & there is nobody equal nor comparable to him (defaulting to the masculine word but doesn‚Äôt by any means gender God contrary to popular belief).‚Äù

Further, to simplify what I said about Allah‚Äôs oneness, I would ask if mathematically we cannot get one from zero (cannot get something -us- from nothing, in other words) then how did we come into being as complex as we are‚Ä¶ or us aside, how about the rest of the universe for that matter? For people who believe in reincarnation who do not believe in a creator (God), for that matter, how then can you get something (1) from nothing (0) & then keep 1-ing repeatedly & also in various forms? Magnetic fields? Ok, who put that there? Well people are born by other people, ok so you worship your parents who were also ‚Äúcreated?‚Äù There surely has to be a creator when we boil down the logic but the creator has to have attributes such as ‚Äúcompletely‚Äù self sufficient. Jesus PBUH? He didn‚Äôt know the hour, he also was taken care of by Mary RA, & he needed to eat/sleep‚Ä¶ in the Bible it says God rested (astagfirullah, Allah forgive me), we do not believe in a God who requires rest‚Ä¶

Anyway, it‚Äôs really interesting to ponder the differences here in belief, I hope something I said may have piqued your interest. I am by no means an expert & always recommended doing your own research too, don‚Äôt just take my word for it but I am also open to a discussion too. In any case, I believe Allah will guide whom he will & I hope you (previous commenter) sincerely seek truth because life is short.",2024-04-23T02:21:48+00:00

‚Äú Agroup of Egyptian Jews were recruited by Israeli military intelligence to plant bombs inside Egyptian-, American-, and British-owned civilian targets: cinemas, libraries, and American educational centers. The bombs were timed to detonate several hours after closing time. The attacks were to be blamed on the Muslim Brotherhood, Egyptian communists, ""unspecified malcontents"", or ""local nationalists"" with the aim of creating a climate of sufficient violence and instability to induce the British government to retain its occupying troops in Egypt's Suez Canal zone.‚Äù

This was also REWARDED by Israel in the recent past:

israelexposed,post,1c9wiur,OkStick4930,A must read for every Pro-Palestine supporter.,"Just a reminder that supporting Palestine means supporting Palestinian resistance.
So remember to uphold ""The Thawabet"" in all of your actions and interactions. Many normalizers are walking among us, our job is to deplatform them.

*Normalisation: Validating the zionist colony's existence by endorsing or collaborating with an individual, group, entity or ideology that represents any form of ""israeli"" aspirations or sentiments.

*Normalisers: The agents of normalisation, they are positioned as patient zero, they spread detrimental language and
imperialist ideologies that are later adopted by those they manipulate and spread through our community to weaken our struggle.

*The Thawabet: The fundamental principles of the Palestinian struggle.
Composed since the historical resistance against British imperialism and carried forward towards its zionist extension today.
‚Ä¢ Reject colonialism in all its manifestations.
‚Ä¢ Denounce normalisation in all its forms.
‚Ä¢ Support resistance against the zionist movement by any means necessary.
‚Ä¢ Free Palestine from occupation by soldiers and settlers, River to Sea with Al Quds as her capital.
‚Ä¢ Secure right of return for all Palestinians.
‚Ä¢ Preserve Palestinian self-determination and self autonomy.

Normalisers employ separatist tactics to break Palestinian unity and normalise settlers. They paint Palestinian liberation as unachievable or even inhumane to their own oppressor. They instil a sense of hopelessness that immobilises and pushes Palestinians to compromise on their demands, here's how you can spot them:
1. Portraying Palestinians as weak, emphasising suffering over resilience
2. Utilising defeatist language to instil helplessness and provoke sympathy rather than action
3. Condemning armed resistance to shame
Palestinians into pacifism and silence
4. Emphasising western identity politics to distract from the unified goal of our liberation
5. Adopting two-state terminology for Palestinian land
6. Platforming settlers as ""AntiZionist israelis"" to separate them from the state and normalise their presence in Palestine as harmless or helpful

israelexposed,comment,l0ql167,JungBag,,"TL;DR Hamas was way more extreme at its beginnings. Its stance has softened quite a bit since, but it still holds extremist ideas. The first step towards peace would be for Israel to cease its illegal occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, withdraw its illegal settlers, and come to agreement to share Jerusalem as a capital city. But all the so-called leaders involved are too stupid, arrogant and war-minded to negotiate peace.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Yes, at its beginnings in 1987, Hamas was extremely anti-Jewish. Its stance has softened over the years, although there are still the extreme ideas, e.g., the liberation of the entire Palestine is their ultimate goal and their aim to establish Shari'ah law. But they have rescinded many of their more extreme ideas.

Prior to October 7, there was a possibility for diplomatic solutions. But that depended on cool, rational minds who realize that the only way to peace is through negotiation, not war and violence. And those are not the ""leaders"" of the Hamas, Israel, USA, surrounding Arabic countries or anyone else involved, it seems.

Here is an excerpt from a recent statement by Hamas:

‚ÄòWe will cooperate with the international community to end Israel's occupation, remove settlements, and withdraw completely from lands occupied in 1967 \[the West Bank and the Gaza Strip\], including Jerusalem, to achieve calm and stability during this phase‚Äô.

If Israel had ended its occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, withdrew their illegal settlers. and shared Jerusalem as the capital of both Israel and Palestine, that would have released a lot of tension in the region.

Justifiably, Hamas does not trust the USA:

‚ÄòOur scepticism is based on experience. You know that despite every call for restraint by the U.S. over the last twenty years the Israelis have continued to expand and develop their vast network of towns and roads on Palestinian land‚Ä¶you \[the U.S. government\] don‚Äôt apply the same preconditions to the Israelis. You don‚Äôt require of them recognition of Palestinian rights or a renunciation of the terrible violence that they daily invoke on us. Nor do you require that they  
comply with previous agreements or the settlement building would long since have stopped.‚Äô

Peace isn‚Äôt possible. It‚Äôs been attempted before but Israel never actually fufills its side. This eventually ends in conflict which leads to a new peace agreement which Israel fails to uphold. Are Palestinian groups innocent ? No they aren‚Äôt they have as much blame with inflaming the conflict but holding random groups to a functioning nation state is unfair. 2nd Israelis well Atleast a significant amount claim they want peace but they think that peace can‚Äôt be had with a Palestinian state this is a mindset that has to be changed to achieve a 2 state solution. If root causes aren‚Äôt adresssed whatever peace proposal is put in place will fail just like every other. Consequences for both sides must be put in place if either of them break the treaty. If there are no consequences there is more to gain with starting the conflict. ",2024-04-21T16:34:42+00:00

However, this seems like an unachievable pipe dream.

The two reports said the Hamas fighters reached the area of the festival without any prior knowledge of the festival, where the Israeli helicopter opened fire on both the Hamas fighters and the participants in the festival.

No not really. Some countries (China. India. Pakistan and a few more) stand clear on their position that nukes will never be used until they get nuked.

I wanted to share a long form interview I just posted with US journalist Abby Martin! I thought it might be of interest to the community here. We dig into her on the ground reporting in Israel, the war in Gaza, her views on Zionism, Hamas, Iran and more!

Would love to know what the community here thinks! Thanks! Watch here: [https://youtu.be/ELk7q82s7Oo?si=80fwK-7qTofAZvbS](https://youtu.be/ELk7q82s7Oo?si=80fwK-7qTofAZvbS)",2024-04-20T08:51:30+00:00
israelexposed,comment,l0fh4hz,justmo17,,"Great interview! I'd like to highlight a few points:

1. Resistance is justified under occupation, as it's shaped by the occupier, leaving only violent forms viable after 80 years. As John F. Kennedy said, 'Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.'

2. Condemning Hamas has been a tactic to justify actions against them‚Äîa narrative I've observed since childhood, where resistance was simply labeled terrorism.

3. The moment Hamas breached the wall was profoundly symbolic for me. Having grown up never imagining that wall could come down, witnessing its fall was tearfully impactful.

4. It‚Äôs surprising that despite the lesser frequency of falsehoods from Hamas compared to Israel, skepticism remains high against Hamas‚Äô claims, particularly regarding the events of October 7th. Their efforts to treat Israelis hostages kindly are documented, yet often dismissed.

5. Comparing the PLO (post-Yasser Arafat) and Hamas: under the PLO, significant land was lost in the West Bank without any benefit to the Palestinian people. In contrast, Gaza has not lost land under Hamas, underscoring that resistance is the only viable option. As peace does not equate to liberation.

6. The lack of awareness among people in Israel always worried me, like a viral Palestinian living in Israel NAS Daily, was unaware of the restrictions faced by Palestinians. He wouldn't believe that as a Palestinian I was unable to visit Jaffa (Tel Aviv), this is alarming and highlights the widespread ignorance in that region.

7. The spread of false news, such as the claim of beheaded babies seen by Biden which was debunked, reminds me of the propaganda technique to justify genocide.  It was a stark realization of the biased media landscape in America.

Your interview provided a valuable platform to discuss these critical issues.",2024-04-20T10:19:56+00:00

israelexposed,post,1c88uit,Helpful-Antelope-678,"Alternatives to Zionism in regards the ""The Jewish Question""?","I'm curious how we feel about Zionism in theory. I consider myself ""anti-Zionist"" in the sense that I oppose the settler colonial state of Israel, but not in the sense that I oppose a Jewish state **IN THEORY**. Of course this isn't new ground and I think a lot of Israel's critiques would support a Jewish State somewhere like, say New Jersey, or wherever it can be set up that won't result in the creation of a **STATELESS AND SUBJUGATED PEOPLE.**

  
I was reading on The General¬†Jewish¬†Labor¬†Bund¬†in Lithuania, Poland and Russia (aka ""The Bund"") and I was fascinated at their alternative to Zionism through **International Jewish Socialism.** They opposed Zionism because, instead of encouraging emigration to Israel, they wanted protection and safety for Jews in their respective countries. Sadly, the Bund was essentially crushed by Lenin's Bolsheviks who wanted Jews to fully integrate into Russian society and essentially abandon their language (Yiddish) and culture. 

  
In regards to today we can all agree that the approach made to Zionism from 1917 to now was horrendous and resulted in a genocidal nightmare for Palestinians. Do we think that a Jewish Internationalist Movement (like the Bund) could present a viable alternative to Zionism in today's world?

israelexposed,comment,l0f3fn0,tarzak,,"I'm saying you're focusing on semantics when the meaning is clear. If there's no definitive genetic Semitic signature then what exactly are Semites and why is it reserved to Jews only?

Zionists were bombing synagogues. It's not exactly far fetched either as it aligned with their political goals at the time. Get more Jews in and more Palestinians out to establish a majority. Not sure why this is controversial also, plenty of videos have shown Zionists and IDF attacking Jews for publicly supporting Palestinians. This general sensitivity to Jewish life and devaluation of Arab life is part of the problem believe it or not. Any Palestinian act of resistance warrants an unrelenting and disproportionate response, but no crime by Israel warrants any Palestinian response. Europe's guilt falls on the shoulders of the Palestinians who had nothing to do with it.

israelexposed,comment,l0f8hij,According_Elk_8383,,"No, you‚Äôre arguing semantics by definitions.

Palestinians don‚Äôt have a unique Semitic signature, as in they are a mix of defined genetic signatures (Lebanese, Syrians, Iraqis, Egyptians, Turks etc.). We know this from mass DNA analysis.

Ironically enough, ‚ÄúPalestinian‚Äù literally means ‚Äúinvader‚Äù in Hebrew.¬†


Jews share DNA across deviations, and regional DNA (Ashkenazi, Sephardim, Mizrahi etc.).

99% of Jews are not converts, and their DNA goes back to proto populations.

It‚Äôs not that people In Palestine don‚Äôt have some of this too, but there is a difference between being in the area and having gene flow - and literally being a Jews, Canaanites etc.¬†

This is why there‚Äôs a lot of propaganda in either direction - and to say they have none would be a lie, but to say Jews are European on the other end is disingenuous.¬†

‚ÄúZionist‚Äôs were bombing synagogues‚Äù.¬†

Hundreds of thousands of Jews were kicked out of their countries, or fled in the Middle East. This is unarguable - it was already an unlivable situation.¬†

Your revisionist bullshit is so thinly veiled.¬†

They didn‚Äôt ‚Äúget Palestinians out‚Äù, the Palestinians fled on behalf of the ‚ÄúArab League / Coalition‚Äù, because in Islam they can‚Äôt live near ruling Jews.

The Arabs started the war, lost, and pretended to be the victim for 80 years.

‚ÄúDevaluation of Arab life‚Äù: Arabized Muslims killed hundreds of millions of people in the last fourteen hundred years. They conquered all of the known world by the sword.

They lost a war in Palestine, and threw a never ending temper tantrum.

They are not victims, they are victimizers and it‚Äôs built into the belief system from Quran, to Hadith, to Tafsir, to biography.¬†

The Mufti of Palestine worked with Hitler (before the creation of the state of Israel), toured Holocaust camps - and wanted Hitler to build death camps in the Middle East.

In the west, the Nakba is when the Palestines were ‚Äúkicked out‚Äù, but in the MENA: it‚Äôs when they failed to ‚Äúfinish what Hitler started‚Äù (as was commonly stated, during that time).",2024-04-20T08:46:45+00:00

Large Jewish migration from Arab states happened after Zionist invasion of Palestine. Not before. And that still does not invalidate the fact that Zionists bombed synagogues in the Middle East to draw Jews into Israel. Talk about thinly veiled revisionist bullshit.

Palestinians were manipulated, disarmed, disenfranchised, slaughtered, raped, kicked out of their homes, and displaced. That is why they fled.

So you're saying Jews are \*entitled\* to subjugate (in a fashion never seen before in modern history) the Palestinians because some of their ancestors killed people? And one of their previous leaders was affiliated with Hitler? Not sure if that's your justification for ethnofascist settler colonial apartheid.

israelexposed,post,1c7b7hp,Dhylan,The U.S. approved an Israeli Attack on the Palestinian city of Rafah in exchange for the postponement of Israeli attacks on Iran.,"Egyptian officials told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed on April 18 that the United States had approved Israel‚Äôs plan for an operation in the city of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, in return for not carrying out a large strike in Iran in response to Tehran‚Äôs unprecedented missile and drone attack.

The Biden administration showed acceptance of the plan previously presented by the occupation government regarding the military operation in Rafah, in exchange for not carrying out a large-scale attack against Iran,‚Äù the official told the Qatari-owned news outlet.  Egyptian preparations are underway to deal with the impact of Israel's planned attack on Rafah.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel over the night of April 13 and 14 in response to an Israeli strike that targeted Iran‚Äôs embassy in the Syrian capital, Damascus, at the beginning of the month and killed a number of its senior members.

Israel has vowed to respond, without saying when or how, while its allies have called on both sides to avoid further escalation.

The Israeli military has been preparing to launch an operation in Rafah for the last few months. More than 1,5 million Palestinains are said to be taking shelter in the city and its surroundings. Objection from the U.S. and other allies has been hindering an Israeli decision on the operation.

While Al-Araby Al-Jadeed‚Äôs report suggests that Israel would cancel a retaliatory strike against Iran in exchange for a green light to attack Rafah, other reports indicate that the Israeli military is still determined to respond to the unprecedented attack by the IRGC.

However, Israel is unlikely to carry out a strike on Iran before the end of Passover, a U.S. official told ABC News on April 18 while acknowledging the timing could change. The Jewish holiday begins on April 22 evening and runs through the end of the month.

The news network also quoted Israeli sources as saying Israel twice readied for and then dropped plans to strike Iran this past week

Senior Iranian officials, including President Ebrahim Raisi, have already warned Israel that any strike on the country‚Äôs territory will be met with a very harsh response. The U.S. has been warned by Iran, Russia and China against taking part in any Israeli attack.",2024-04-18T18:50:26+00:00

israelexposed,post,1c6jlym,Silent-Olive-168,I just found this terribly accurate poem,"I am Israel. I came to a land without a people for a people without a land. Those people who happened to be here, had no right to be here, and my people showed them they had to leave or die, razing 480 Palestinian villages to the ground, erasing their history.

I am Israel. Some of my people committed massacres and later became Prime Ministers to represent me. In 1948, Menachem Begin was in charge of the unit that slaughtered the inhabitants of Deir Yassin, including 100 men, women, and children. In 1953, Ariel Sharon led the slaughter of the inhabitants of Qibya, and in 1982 arranged for our allies to butcher around 2,000 in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila.

I am Israel. Carved in 1948 out of 78% of the land of Palestine, dispossessing its inhabitants and replacing them with Jews from Europe and other parts of the world. While the natives whose families lived on this land for thousands of years are not allowed to return, Jews from all over the world are welcome to instant citizenship.

I am Israel. In 1967, I swallowed the remaining lands of Palestine - the West Bank and Gaza - and placed their inhabitants under an oppressive military rule, controlling and humiliating every aspect of their daily lives. Eventually, they should get the message that they are not welcome to stay, and join the millions of Palestinian refugees in the shanty camps of Lebanon and Jordan.

I am Israel. I have the power to control American policy. My American Israel Public Affairs Committee can make or break any politician of its choosing, and as you see, they all compete to please me. All the forces of the world are powerless against me, including the UN as I have the American veto to block any condemnation of my war crimes. As Sharon so eloquently phrased it, ‚ÄúWe control America‚Äù.

I am Israel. I influence American mainstream media too, and you will always find the news tailored to my favor. I have invested millions of dollars into PR representation, and CNN, New York Times, and others have been doing an excellent job of promoting my propaganda. Look at other international news sources and you will see the difference.

I am Israel. You Palestinians want to negotiate ‚Äúpeace!?‚Äù But you are not as smart as me; I will negotiate, but will only let you have your municipalities while I control your borders, your water, your airspace and anything else of importance. While we ‚Äúnegotiate,‚Äù I will swallow your hilltops and fill them with settlements, populated by the most extremist of my extremists, armed to the teeth. These settlements will be connected with roads you cannot use, and you will be imprisoned in your little Bantustans between them, surrounded by checkpoints in every direction.

I am Israel. I have the fourth strongest army in the world, possessing nuclear weapons. How dare your children confront my oppression with stones, don‚Äôt you know my soldiers won‚Äôt hesitate to blow their heads off? In 17 months, I have killed 900 of you and injured 17,000, mostly civilians, and have the mandate to continue since the international community remains silent. Ignore, as I do, the hundreds of Israeli reserve officers who are now refusing to carry out my control over your lands and people; their voices of conscience will not protect you.

I am Israel. You want freedom? I have bullets, tanks, missiles, Apaches and F-16s to obliterate you. I have placed your towns under siege, confiscated your lands, uprooted your trees, demolished your homes, and you still demand freedom? Don‚Äôt you get the message? You will never have peace
or freedom, because I am Israel.",2024-04-17T20:01:39+00:00

Just read about Mordechai Vanunu‚Äôs early life and how his contempt for the Israeli state (which would come to overshadow his sympathy for Palestinians) initially came about from his experience growing up as a part-Moroccan Jew. 

While all Jews are equal there now, having taken maybe 40 years since its inception to enshrine this idea legally, some remnants of this history still exist. 
It‚Äôs deeply rooted, perhaps through socio-economic factors or depending on which communities received more of a certain type of Jew. 
The same way anti-black racism in the west exists bc of crime which contributes to negative stigma. The way blacks were underprivileged for so long led to a lower socio-economic status + hampered cultural development/ties to their homes which in turn forces them to live in bad areas with limited opportunities and lack of resources to raise a child. And obv it‚Äôs not a coincidence that underprivileged people engage in more crime.

Besides racism, though, the European Jews also felt they were the ones to build up the nation, fought for it (aka terrorize Palestinians and the British garrison) and had set up the foundations for the modern state. But in reality they only preceded the Mizrahi Jews‚Äô arrival by like 20-30 years lol.",2024-04-17T10:42:34+00:00

> It must be noted that witnesses and sources with whom the mission team engaged adopted over time an increasingly cautious and circumspect approach regarding past accounts, including in some cases retracting statements made previously

> While the mission team was able to meet with some released hostages as
well as with some survivors and witnesses of the attacks, it did not meet with any survivor/victim of sexual violence from 7 October despite concerted efforts encouraging them to come forward.

israelexposed,comment,kzxkhk9,Hantalyte,,"The report directly admits that it was non-investigative:

> The mission was neither intended to, and nor could the mission team, in such a short period of time, establish the prevalence of conflict-related sexual violence during and after the 7 October attacks. The overall magnitude, scope, and specific attribution of these violations would require a comprehensive investigation by competent bodies

> The mission was not intended to be, and is not a substitute for, an investigation by relevant United Nations entities mandated for that purpose, nor is it a replacement for criminal investigations and proceedings subject to due process of law

Patten did not try to hide this. She has reiterated this numerous times. This begs the question: how *did* they determine whether or not something was ""credible"" or ""reliable"" if they did not investigate it?

Here is another thing with the report:

> The mission team received credible information about bodies found naked and/or tied, and in one case gagged, in some of the kibbutz‚Äô destroyed houses and their surroundings. While verification of sexual violence against these victims was not possible, circumstantial evidence ‚Äì notably the pattern of female victims found undressed and bound ‚Äì may be indicative of some forms of sexual violence

She is literally admitting that there was no verification of any of this, that what they considered ""reliable"" was based on circumstancial indictator when they knew that Israel has meddled with these scenes. Regarding that:

> Another such account was the interpretation initially made of the body of a girl found separated from the rest of her family, naked from the waist down. It was determined by the mission team that the crime scene had been altered by a bomb squad and the bodies moved, explaining the separation of the body of the girl from the rest of her family

If Israel completely separated them, why could they not falsify the scene? Whether you like it or not, the entire scene becomes worthless when it is known to be fundamentally altered. It also was not just the IDF altering these scenes, but also ZAKA.

When I mentioned that there is no medicolegal evidence of rape in videos and photographs, your ""gotcha"" moment was that there was limited circumstancial evidence. Do you not realize how ridiculous that is?

When I mentioned that they could not interview and survivors, you only responded by bring up how they were ""made aware"" by the Israeli government of survivors. How do you believe this nonsense? It is obvious Israeli propaganda.

As for getting information from the Israeli government, it is clearly biased here as well as known to lie, so every claim from them NEEDS to be verified, which they admitted that they did not. Independent sources would be better.",2024-04-17T02:52:36+00:00

Take for example, the Bible has multiple prophesies about Israel being attacked in the future and especially a lot of christian supporters of Israel like to use these prophesies to show that the land that God gave Israel will go under attack many times, for example Zechariah 12:3-4: And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.

1) if you‚Äôre going to blasphcmisze the prophet Muhammed (s) you should also do the same for prophet Isaac who was 40+ when he married Rebecca. According to the Bible, Rebecca‚Äôs age at the time was anywhere between 3-14. Of course marriage was much different in that day and age so I don‚Äôt think either are ‚Äúpedophiles‚Äù but in terms of your thought process you are also calling Prophet Isaac a pedo

2) even though the prophet may have married her at 9, it is forbidden in Islam to lay with a women even if she is your wife if she has not achieved puberty. Back in that day and age, there was no condoms or birth control so the fact the prophet was married to Aiysha for years and never had a child with her, it is reasonable to infer they did not bed. 

I also do agree that the Bible is Gods word as well. However the fact that the oldest Bible we can trace only goes back to the Roman Empire in the 4th century CE (400 years after prophet Jesus rose) and is not even in the original language that Jesus (AS) spoke means that there was alot of human intervention in the book itself. The Council of Nicea that was held that happened in 325 AD is when modern Christianity was adopted had none of the apostolates or prophets of god and in my opinion was highly motivated by Roman supremacy complex and skewed the word of god in their favor.",2024-04-16T13:42:24+00:00

1. Nowhere in the Bible does it say that Rebecca was anywhere from the age of 3-14 years old so that is a false assumption not based on facts. In the Bible the age God considers someone as an adult is the age of 20 years old and older (Num 1:3, Exodus 30:14, Num 1:18 etc‚Ä¶)


2.  Let's look at the words of Aisha herself 
 in Sunan an-Nasa'i 3378; Vol. 4, Book 26, Hadith 3380.
The Messenger of Allah [Ô∑∫] married me when I was six year's old, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, >and I used to play with dolls.<


Sahih al-Bukhari 5158 (it's Narrated so it's strong )
Narrated 'Urwa: 
The Prophet (Ô∑∫) wrote the (marriage contract) with `Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death).


Sahih Bukhari Hadith 3896
Narrated Hisham's father:
Khadija died three years before the Prophet (Ô∑∫) departed to Medina. He stayed there for two years or so and then he married `Aisha when she was a girl of six years of age, and he consummated that marriage when she was nine years old.

But why do they come to thee for decision, when they have (their own) law before them?- therein is the (plain) command of Allah; yet even after that, they would turn away. For they are not (really) People of Faith 

(This shows the Jews have the correct bible to follow and are gonna be judged by it. This is written 624 ad the bible we have is translated from manuscripts older than that)


Surah 5:44
It was We who revealed the law (to Moses): therein was guidance and light. By its standard have been judged the Jews, by the prophets who bowed (as in Islam) to Allah's will, by the rabbis and the doctors of law: for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah's book, and they were witnesses thereto: therefore fear not men, but fear me, and sell not my signs for a miserable price. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (no better than) Unbelievers.

(In 624 ad it is confirmed that the doctors/rabbis of the law possess the correct Torah) (if the bible is corrupted then that means we have a different bible than the bible of those doctors of the law in 624 which is not true so the bible we have is the same and true bible from 624 ad)(therefore if you do not believe the bible you are an unbeliever )


Surah 3:83-84
Do they seek for other than the Religion of Allah?-while all creatures in the heavens and on earth have, willing or unwilling, bowed to His Will (Accepted Islam), and to Him shall they all be brought back.
84; Say: ""We believe in Allah, and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in (the Books) given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord: We make no distinction between one and another among them, and to Allah do we bow our will (in Islam).‚Äù

(Now what was given unto Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes. It would be the Torah, the prophets, the Psalms, and gospels. The bible back in 624 is the same we have today)

We settled the Children of Israel in a beautiful dwelling-place, and provided for them sustenance of the best: it was after knowledge had been granted to them, that they fell into schisms. Verily Allah will judge between them as to the schisms amongst them, on the Day of Judgment.

10:94
If thou wert in doubt as to what We have revealed unto thee, then ask those who have been reading the Book from before thee: the Truth hath indeed come to thee from thy Lord: so be in no wise of those in doubt

2) I never claimed that Aiyesha wasn‚Äôt a child at marriage. She was given to the prophet at a young age but ‚Äúconsummation‚Äù of marriage in Islam at that day and age had nothing to do with sex. [Here](https://islamqa.info/amp/en/answers/854) is a definition of Islamic consummation. This is the issue with translation of Arabic text into English because there is no word for it so they use the closest definition they can and it leads to misunderstanding. Consumption of marriage includes praying for and with your wife alone to show to god you are United in your worship to him as a couple. Not having sex as it means in todays day and age. 

Surah 5:43 (implying the Torah is the true word) if you read just 30 verses before in the same Surah 5:13 ‚ÄúBut for breaking their covenant We condemned them and hardened their hearts. They distorted the words of the Scripture and neglected a portion of what they had been commanded to uphold. You ÀπO ProphetÀ∫ will always find deceit on their part, except for a few. But pardon them and bear with them. Indeed, Allah loves the good-doers.‚Äù This shows that the tribes thar descended from Moses rewrote the Torah to be what it is today and could also imply the existence of the Talmud which was written by man thousands of years after Moses passes and used by many Jews to justify Zionism in todays day and age


Surah 3:83 just 5 verses earlier in 3:79 it states ‚ÄúThere are some among them who distort the Book with their tongues to make you think this ÀπdistortionÀ∫ is from the Book‚Äîbut it is not what the Book says. They say, ‚ÄúIt is from Allah‚Äù‚Äîbut it is not from Allah. And ÀπsoÀ∫ they attribute lies to Allah knowingly.‚Äù Again showing distortion at the hands of people. 

The key hear is that the gospel of today contains not just the word of God received untainted by Jesus (AS) but also the biographies of Matthew, Luke, and Mark who were not given revelations. These are similar to Hadith in Islam but should not be treated as God‚Äôs word. Of course these are small differences which is why fell back on the verse I mentioned below about how god will judge between the differences of Jews, Christians, Muslims on a case by case basis. And there are many Christians and Jews that will enter heaven before some Muslims due to the fact thy believed and worshiped god righteously. 


[here](https://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/pedophilia.html) is a link to some verses that non-believers claim that the Bible condones pedophilia within. Of course, I, as a Muslim, do not believe the Bible condones this action as I have read it in its totality and know the context if these verses. this is just to present how taking singular verses can cause the meaning to be skewed.

Edit: I apologize on behalf of the other Muslims for the downvotes. You are honestly trying to have a peaceful discourse and I don‚Äôt know why so many Muslims are fearful of being questioned.",2024-04-16T18:26:30+00:00

Hold up does that mean I can read the most complex book on string theory pick any line and claim that it's accurate and when someone tries to correct me I go okay so explain it to me? That's exactly what you're doing I'd need to be an expert and so would you and even if we assume that I am an expert, are you?  
 
Also when you're asking these questions I'm around 90% sure you're picking them straight up from some Christian website that is specifically designed to target Islam. 
 
Why is it that you have to take two minutes to search it up and then I have to spend some time reading up on the context and tafsir of the Quran? All just so you can delete your comment or straight up reject what I'm saying?",2024-04-16T16:47:50+00:00

I do not need to tell you if I am an expert or not, but you're saying it is out of context you do not know if I've already read the verses before and after you just want to say that as an easy out I want you to go into your Quran read and put it into context it's not really that hard otherwise you cannot defend your religion.

What? Do you even understand what I mean by context? If one verse talks about the non-believers then the next starts with ""they"" it's obviously still talking about the non believers.

Lol I don't need to defend my religion, it's when uneducated clowns like you say stuff that is straight up wrong do I bother to correct you.

Why do you need to learn Islam to defend Christianity? I've never studied your books, I just need to learn Islam to talk about it. The only reason that you need to learn Islam is to go on these personal attacks. You know you can't defend Christianity so instead you choose to attack other religions.

israelexposed,comment,kzy6cn2,Impish-Flower,,"I can see why someone might think that, but this is easily doable. 

The sound of drones is not the obvious problem you think it is, and neither is volume. Also, the need for real believability is low, though certainly higher now. People only need to check for a moment, pop their head out the window to look, to get shot. It only takes a moment; they don't need to buy the fiction for long minutes.

The sound of drones is not a terribly uncommon thing to hear there. There's a kind of background noise of destruction and drones and aircraft. It's at the point where Palestinians have talked about how clear the quiet during a ceasefire is. So, there's often going to be the sound of various aircraft, and it isn't necessarily the obvious red flag you seem to think.

Volume isn't as much of a problem, especially in urban areas (even destroyed ones). Audio carries, and something in the air that's louder will sound quieter by the time it reaches the ground. Sometimes, you can tell that something's loud and far away, but the brain will play subconscious tricks on our perceptions based on what our brains expect. 

(Are you familiar optical illusions where things will look like they're a different shape or hue than you know they are? Like, you know this picture of an flower is only in shades of grey, but you can swear you see it as red. The brain can play crazy tricks on your perception. There's been lots of research on this, and it can be both fascinating and terrifying.)

So, when people hear audio of a little kid crying, we know how loud that would be, instinctually, and so we would unconsciously gauge where the child is based on that volume, and would have a much harder time realising that it's actually much louder and farther away, and echoes make it harder to tell that it's coming from the air, or that it's not coming from where you hear it. It would be very easily to calibrate the volume of the speakers in the drone to hit the right level to sound right to ears on the ground in the target area.

And lastly, this is about human nature. Even in a place like occupied Palestine, maybe especially in such a place, your first instinct when you hear someone suffering is to help them, if you are a decent human. That instinct can affect our reasoning ability, and that's why this kind of strategy is effective. It won't affect everyone enough to catch them, but it's not intended to.

  
But all that is just to try to help explain it. We know they did this, and we know it worked. We have a [respected news organisation reporting it](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/4/16/israels-war-on-gaza-live-israel-vows-response-to-iran?update=2841397), and this the kind of tactic we know people have employed before, as you point out.",2024-04-17T06:01:37+00:00

So, terrorist is can be defined in anyway, depending from the perspective from which you argue it. It's political rhetoric , a court in this instance , would have to designate it to a group based on objective evidence.

Now we're seeing Daesh pop out the woodwork again, just in time too because as always, they only ever attack everyone but Israel (the ones bombing Muslims).

The agreement was finalized after three months of talks by the Zionist Federation of Germany, the Anglo-Palestine Bank (under the directive of the Jewish Agency) and the economic authorities of Nazi Germany. It was a major factor in making possible the migration of approximately 60,000 German Jews to Palestine between 1933 and 1939.[1]

>The agreement enabled Jews fleeing persecution under the new Nazi regime to transfer some portion of their assets to British Mandatory Palestine.[2] Emigrants sold their assets in Germany to pay for essential goods (manufactured in Germany) to be shipped to Mandatory Palestine.[3][4] The agreement was controversial and was criticised by many Jewish leaders both within the Zionist movement (such as the Revisionist Zionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky) and outside it, as well as by members of both the Nazi Party and the German public.",2024-04-15T13:45:45+00:00

israelexposed,comment,kzp0sxh,isawasin,,"I don't mean to jump down your throat. Perhaps you mean well, but what you've stated is unprincipled drivel. Do you believe you would have called Nelson Mandela and the organisation (the ANC) he helped lead terrorist, in their (often violent) fight against apartheid in South Africa? What about the FLN in the Algerian War of independence? Were they terrorists for fighting French colonialism? The Viet Cong? Were they just as bad as the French for turning to armed struggle to force out a brutally violent colonize who had no intention of relinquishing dominion? At the time that they were actively struggling against oppression and occupation with clear parallels to what Palestinian resistance is engaging, the""civilised world"" was absolutely calling them all terrorists. Can you imagine calling Nelson Mandela a terrorist? Plenty of ""civilised"" people did.

Hamas has engaged in non-violent struggle (have you even heard of the great march of return? Look it up and then ask yourself why you haven't) and were met with violence no less sadistic than what we are witnessing now. Did you applaud while they were non-violently resisting? Israel's response to peaceful protest - which took place in Gaza, where Israel should have no jurisdiction - was met with brutality beyond belief and,I can say without fear of hyperbole, [one of the most grotesque headlines in history.](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2020-03-06/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/42-knees-in-one-day-israeli-snipers-open-up-about-shooting-gaza-protesters/0000017f-f2da-d497-a1ff-f2dab2520000)

Any decent person was stunned at the violence of Oct. 7th. But true decency requires unflinching honesty. And that level of honesty makes things very clear. The root of the violence is the occupation. It is colonisation, and until the world lives up to its claim of decency and equity under international law, armed resistance will not only continue, it is morally and legally justified.

Under settler colonialism, any kind of resistance is branded as terrorist because the only
acceptable violence is violence by the occupier.
There is always going to be violent resistance against a violent occupation. Make all the judgements or condemnations you like, they
will not matter. It is inevitable. if you don't want the violent resistance, you have to want to see the end of the violent occupation. If you want to be part of the solution, you can't keep ""both sides-ing"" this. No justice, no peace is more than just a slogan,and it's not a threat. It's cold, hard logic; it's human nature.

I challenge you to think of one historical example of a struggle between an oppressed people against their oppressor, an occupied and colonised people and their colonisers - anything from a violent slave revolt to the wars I mentioned earlier and beyond - where history hasn't entirely vindicated the oppressed and colonised people in their fight, even when it became violent. I can't think of one, can you? History goes beyond simple vindication. It has absolved  those freedom fighters of responsibility in the broad sense. Their individual consciences are their own to bear, but because imperialism and colonialism are inherently violent. It is [founded in violence](https://youtu.be/1mBUzayokz0?si=a8K5OEmhS28jV3B6) and it is maintained by violence. It meets resistance with violence regardless of whether that resistance is itself violent or peaceful.

The violence of the oppressed in their fight against oppression is not equivalent to the violence their oppressor uses to maintain it. To believe otherwise is patently unprincipled. You can't be a meaningful part of the solution until you accept that, and I hope you want to be.

I highly recommend you watch the documentary I linked to understand that while this conflict does go back decades, it doesn't go back forever. There is a root cause. The history is complex. Morally, there is nothing complex about on which side decent people should unequivocally and unapologetically stand.",2024-04-15T15:55:30+00:00

I dug a little deeper, they are organizing money to help people flee Gaza which of course seems great on its face but some people raised questions they aren't addressing.

No right of return is talked about and paying Palestinians to leave permanently is a right wing Israeli tactic that's been used for years:

https://www.tiktok.com/@operationolivebranch?_t=8lX905djzgN&_r=1

They are having people use GFM and launder money into Gaza which makes any donor liable for Aiding Terrorism and RICO charges. They are dealing in millions of dollars. Palestinians are sitting in US prisons for life already because of this sort of thing.

This is the kind of thing reactionaries and zionists pray for too. When zionists don‚Äôt find legitimate antisemitism, they invent it. Some people here are helping them skip a step.

What bothers me the most is people saying a thing, being told ‚Äúhey that‚Äôs antisemitic.‚Äù (Or what have you) Instead of examining what they said and possibly correcting it, they lash out and double down. I can tell you with absolute certainty that my wife finds a statement about being Jewish making someone suspicious to be offensive. It‚Äôs usually right wing reactionaries who think THEY are the ones who get to define what counts as bigotry, rather than the people on the receiving end. 

It‚Äôs not like the comment in question is a terrible and unforgivable act and that I want the person arrested or shamed. I only mean to point out that saying that Judaism makes a person suspicious is a bad look and takes away from the legitimacy of our movement. I‚Äôm not aware and sensitive to every culture and background on Earth, and like all humans, I have prejudices a d failures to understand. I always say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you on your shit, please call me on mine‚Äù. That‚Äôs how growth happens. It‚Äôs a big part of what being progressive is all about.

israelexposed,post,1c3vsme,Helpful-Antelope-678,The uptick in Iranian pro-Israeli propaganda we're going to see,"Both online and irl, I've had Israel supporters constantly use Iran as some type of ""gotcha"". Something along the line of ""well if you really cared about the Middle East you'd condemn Iran's horrible policies"" and the like. A common trend were, often wealthy, members of the Iranian diaspora using the 2022 protests and Mahsa Amini's horrific death as an excuse for why Israel must be supported.

Lately I've seen Zionists go as far to say that Iran is funding Hamas due to a joint effort to create a ""global caliphate to destroy western civilization"" (which is of course super racist). To those people I usually say something like:

I'll concede that there is a cognitive dissonance of supporting the Palestinian struggle while being disgusted by Iran's blatant human right's violations. That being said, I am not a proponent of NATO regime change and us stepping in to ""save"" Iranian women from the subjugation they experience (especially since our own ally Saudi Arabia is even worse in that regard). Many Iranian diaspora who, understandably, hate the Islamic Republic **have appeared to channel this hatred into Islamophobia and, in turn, have started supporting Israel's actions against Gaza.** They then have the gall to accuse anti-Zionists of ""supporting the Islamic Republic""!! 

During the 2022 protests there was a lot of misinformation about Iran, such as them sentencing 15,000 protesters to death, which was completely false. The protests resulted in the banning of physical punishment and a ""review of the hijab policy"". **IRAN IS PRETTY FUCKED IN A LOT OF WAYS AND NOBODY'S DENYING THAT.** However, their embassy was attacked and they objectively have the right to defend themselves. As supporters of the Palestinian struggle, we have to welcome the support they receive, even if it comes from governments we don't personally ""approve of"", such as Iran or the Houthis. 

I would love to hear what you all think.

israelexposed,comment,kzhl5jv,Helpful-Antelope-678,,"I read through your comments but I'll respond to them here. Lol i had to pull out the laptop for this one. I think your friend is pretty indoctrinated into Israel and probably has fond memories there. As a result it might be hard for them to look past common Israeli talking points. 

1. Like you already mentioned, the hospital accusation from Israel was that Hamas was using a hospital as a ""command center"" and there was no proof of that whatsoever. The closest thing to evidence was a photo of a bunch of guns allegedly hidden them. Let's assume that the IDF didn't plant those (which they very well could have). That brings me to my next point.
2. It is true that a school or hospital can lose protected status if military operations are happening BUT the burden of proof is on the attacker and the attacker is obligated to give a warning to civilians. Israel has failed on both of these accounts. But, for arguments sake, let's assume that the accusations of schools and hospitals are true.
3. There's a principle of international law called Proportionate Response. This means that you can only get away with killing civilians if the military advantage is big enough to justify it. So like if it's a huge Hamas commander being killed in residential area, you might be able to get away with come collateral damage. But killing a whole family just to get one SUSPECTED rank-and-file Hamas member is unacceptable (Israel does this all the time). Similarly, you can't justify bombing a hospital or ambulance and KILLING CIVILIANS just because you THINK there might be weapons on there. This brings me to human shields.
4. **Gaza is one of the most population dense places on earth.** It's a open-air prison of Israel's design so of course Hamas fighters will be within vicinity to civilians. This does not mean that Israel can just indiscriminately fire. Hamas isn't a bunch of supervillains dressed up as stereotypical terrorists out of a Jeff Dunham special. These guys PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS who are largely orphans that have never been outside of Gaza. It's hard to believe that they have some grand masterful plan to ""enmesh themselves so they can use as many human shields as possible"". Now there is an argument to be made that Hamas, in some ways, benefits from civilians deaths but imo that does not prove the ""Human Shields"" theory. 
5. I'll concede that some of the accusations against Hamas launching rockets out of schools are plausible. But to point number 3, the extent of the accusations and the threat these shitty homemade rockets pose to Israel is NOWHERE NEAR the level of danger posed to justify killing 4000 STUDENTS. Especially since they've targeted much more schools than have been accused of being near launch sites. 
6. In regards to the Nova Festival, it appears as though Hamas and other Gazan orgs/civilians, had planned to break out of the containment zone and didn't realize the festival was there. From there they, without a doubt, DELIBERATELY ATTACKED CIVILIANS at the festival. It would be foolish to deny that Hamas went after civilians, including taking hostages with the hope that there would be a hostage exchange. In regards to your point about the military base, the festival was near kibbutzim that were housing IDF soldiers. 
7. Hamas definitely carried out atrocities during October 7th. Targeting civilians and taking hostages are both objectively war crimes. HOWEVER the sexual violence accusations are extremely dubious and that's a whole other threads worth of stuff to talk about. That being said, I WOULD NEVER CONDEMN THEM. It would be like condemning water for boiling when heated over a stove. Gazans have been subjected to apartheid and horrendous conditions for decades, of course they're gonna fight back.",2024-04-14T04:12:18+00:00

israelexposed,comment,kzhw34v,CacaoEcua,,"Even if such stories spread by zionist media and their supporters were true, it doesn't matter. Israel started the whole thing by settling and colonizing in land that belongs to the Palestinian people.

Your talk of ""both sides"" shows you want to be a big brain centrist and listen to all involved. While some people will congratulate you for your ""intellectual openness"" I will condemn you, for opening your brain to the shit spouted from the mouths of the zionists will only give you an infection. If you are young or only recently investigating this issue then I guess it is inevitable that you will want to consider ""both sides"" but hopefully you won't fall for the lies.

Look up Theodor Herzl, the Jewish Colonial Trust, look at the origins of Israel. It is a project founded in a desire to colonize a land that belonged to another people, a people they saw and continue to see as savages. There can be no peace while Israel occupies Palestinian land.

I say this to you as a descendant of Jewish victims of the holocaust. Israel doesn't represent us. We reject zionism. Zionism is contrary to Jewish teaching and contrary to humanity. The silly zionists want us to go and die as a nation in a foreign land, but we will stay here in the diaspora, we'd rather fight for our freedom and equality where we are and we have largely achieved it. The zionist project puts us all in danger because they seek to equate zionism and it's crimes with Judaism - they seek to smear us all with the blood they have on their hands. I will not accept this, I am clean, I have no blood on my hands, I will never support Israel no one who understood the holy texts could possibly endorse their crazy project.

As for the berlin wall, it is a hyper nuanced and complex piece of history. East germany was not only more damaged by the end of the war due to the ferocity of the fighting, but was the least industrialised and poorest sector of germany before and during the war also ever heard of the marshal plan? The us who's homeland was untouched by the fighting and infact made a killing during the war, in an attempt to bolster the position of capitalism in europe sent butt loads of money to Western Europe. Whilst east germany was forced to pay for the total destruction they had wrought on eastern europe.
 (which il admit was rather silly because they couldnt) now throw in the us demanding half of berlin along with the cold war now in full swing and you have a recipe for chaos. Think about it, the best way to live as a german in berlin back then was to recieve a free education in east germany (not free in the west) then walk down the street and use that education to get a high paying job for a western company with plenty of us capital to go round.

israelexposed,comment,kzj45si,Side-Secret,,"Jordanian here. I can confirm the first part, but not the second part. The reason why is that the king knows he doesn't need to create more trouble for himself at home. Plus, the shooting of the drones was done mostly not by israel, but by the heavy concentration of air defense systems from the US in jordan, their bases are located within the areas of american presence (northern jordan, directly near the Suwaida and Daraa countrysides). Abdallah is too much of a coward to dare shoot the drones on his own, cuz he knows the public backlash will end up tarnishing the crown's reputation and  his son's chances of succession.

Tbh at this point, Abdallah has transformed the Monarchy into a dead regime, and his son, if he is super competent, will be at best the last king of jordan, either the israelis/ americans take the regime down, for not being good enough like al Sisi, or the people take it down over what's going on in Palestine.

Finally regarding some of the comments on jordan, no we did not betray anyone, neither in 1967 or 1948. We were betrayed twice, in 1968 and 1970 and hold nothing against anyone. The blame must be targeted in the furst place against the syrian regime, as Hafedh betrayed the Arabs three time in less than a decade",2024-04-14T13:39:03+00:00

israelexposed,comment,l05neaq,TheJordanianYoutuber,,"This is literally what happened, history says so.

King Abdullah I, the first king of Jordan, had no interest for a Palestinian state and had expansionist ideals instead. He dreamt of being ruler of Greater Syria, and because of said ideals that earned him the distrust of most Arab nations (save for Iraq which was ruled by the Hashemites at the time).

Prior to the war, King Abdullah I went and talked with Golda Meir trying to convince her to let Jordan absorb all of Palestine, promising here that the Jews will be protected citizens. She obviously refused.

So they both agreed on where they would specifically fight, and the king settled for the West Bank. East Jerusalem ultimately came under the control of the Jordanians in the aftermath of the war, and all Palestinians living there were given Jordanian citizenship.

Tbh, I respectfully  disagree, there are a lot of good arguments against Biden during his infamously long career in politics. He has provided 40 years to pick through and critique. Which is why I find it even more odd people spend time talking about his son.

Part of me feels like the right doesn't talk about Biden's actual past problems because it would require research, nuanced discussion, and open them up for similar critiques. I feel like most people only want to talk about a smoking gun, Something so clearly wrong that it is the ONLY item of discussion and worthy of clear condemnation.

Each of them have their own prophets and they have their own idea of what their scriptures say even though when they found some of them, they were not complete because they were old and had fallen apart. The religious people took it upon themselves to finish the thoughts for themselves with rules they wanted for their women/people. I won‚Äôt name one in particular religion but I have it in mind. 

Many people do not read their holy book and rely on others to tell them their interpretation. Many things can be twisted to whatever the teacher wants them to believe if you aren‚Äôt careful. 

Any ‚Äúholy book‚Äù that preaches for you to murder people in cold blood or that one person is worth less than another human being I do not believe is a book God would want associated with his name. 

I believe we all pray to the same God but we all have different names for him and many religious beliefs are corrupt. 

Some believe that Jesus was a prophet and some do not even want to teach about him even though they know he was a part of biblical times/history. 
The only holy book I go by is the Bible because (not the only reason, there are many, many more)we‚Äôre supposed to love each other and be peaceful. 
Even Christians nowadays have lost their way. I‚Äôm not perfect, I sin everyday but I‚Äôm trying. 

I understand the upset and I think many people have the wrong idea about Christianity these days because of how it‚Äôs gotten intertwined in politics these days. 

Even Jesus said :
Matthew 22:21
‚ÄúRender therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar‚Äôs; and unto God the things that are God‚Äôs.‚Äù
Which in my eyes means that we should keep church and state separate. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the long answer, I hope it helps. If I didn‚Äôt answer anything, I will try again. As I said, I don‚Äôt have all of the answers, if anyone tells you they do, they aren‚Äôt being truthful.

I just want to say that I am no one special, I just felt like I needed to say something.

If you think about metal gettting hot in a furnace, the temperature it ""melts"" at is when it's a liquid. But before that, you can shape and form it with a hammer at much lower temperatures. This is because the integrity of the steel is weakened.

While I'm pretty sure that 9/11 was the mossad, or maybe CIA under instruction of bush, the documentaries I've seen are not good at researching and it's a shame. The Israelis had a lot to gain by dragging the USA into a wider war and imo they clearly played a part in it. Especially since their brazenness is on display today.",2024-04-14T01:39:35+00:00

israelexposed,comment,kzh1ni6,SkaldofKittens,,"Israel functions as an imperial outpost of the USA. The United States, through, Israel has an army, and an intelligence agency that will do the work of destabilizing the region and looming over it as a threat. This gives US important intel about the region and access to it that would normally require a full on invasion but Israel does this for the US in exchange for the US supporting their colonization of Palestine with money and weapons. This gives US business interests access to important resources throughout the region like oil and trade route bottlenecks like the Suez. For example, Egypt once tried to nationalize the Suez and Israel attacked Egypt to undermine Egypt‚Äôs sovereignty and prevent it from doing that. This aligns perfectly with US and European business interests. This is the dynamic in a nutshell. The US gets an ideologically motivated army and intelligence agency to do its dirty work without having to commit American lives thus.. the US government doesn‚Äôt have to convince the American people of anything. Biden said it himself, ‚ÄúIf Israel didn‚Äôt exists, America would need to invent Israel to protect her interests in the region‚Äù",2024-04-14T01:41:31+00:00
israelexposed,comment,kzh7v43,unga-unga,,"I'm sure that R Dawson makes several mistakes in every documentary he has released, however he does a good job, in The Empire Unmasked and other productions, of organizing a dizzying array of information into a digestible narrative. The slow walk to the same conclusions involves about 20 books, and alot of fact-checking legwork. Which we should all be doing, all the time, with everything...

And anyways, the particular of the steel beams issue does not really impact my personal perception of the situation generally. The massive amount of circumstantial evidence, establishing for an almost certain fact that the plan was not only know by, but funded by, a coalition of intelligence services including the CIA, mossad, and the Saudis. 

The pieces really start to fall in place when you zoom out, and learn what we do know because it is declassified and available through FOIA, about the history of both the CIA and FBI, really beginning before they are formally founded with their current titles. The patterns established in previous occurances, coupled with the consistency of motive that can be inferred, makes September eleventh almost comically obvious. It would not really even matter if controlled demolition took place - although I think that it did, and not only due to the relationship of thermal & structural data. Freefall occured, a symmetrical fall was observed, a minimal footprint was achieved, and 7 was reported as down approximately 3 minutes before it fell. A fall guy was established for 7, since the plane that was supposed to strike it never left the ground, with the van packed with explosives. However he was not utilized,  which is almost nore suspicious than if he had been... There's so many reasons why it's incontrovertible. I would end up with 8 or 12 paragraphs if I went on enumerating them all...

But your point is valid. The 9/11 conspiracy crowd, like with the UFO crowd or the JFK crowd, is infected with disinformation on a pretty impressive scale. From Jewish space lasers to ""there were no planes, only missiles,"" there is really no end to the shit that was flung around over the years of the public's most intense curiosity. By the time crucial documents became available via FOIA, nobody cared anymore.",2024-04-14T02:26:53+00:00

I'm thinking about the ones hiding in America or Europe that have been trying to recruit new members. They've been ranting about Jews controlling the government and how they are actually evil, and they're the good guys.

 Now with Israels actions and our inaction to stop them they have valid talking points. Now look at the state of the world. The poor education for pandemic students. Lower opportunities all around with the economy. The hopelessness of the climate etc. look at the issues caused by mass immigration without any real government support. Gen z may disagree with how against these things we are. But that's because of our education and world experience. But I believe we take for granted this world view of our generation. That we assume like all other generations before us that the younger ones will see the world as we did growing up. As is the nature of generational ignorance. 

These next 10 years we are going to see an explosive growth of far right in our youth. For they have been forsaken, and made vulnerable. Told not to care so much because there is nothing they can do to fix it. But when the human spirit is told there's no chance it desires nothing more than to find a way. To vulture factions like the modern day Nazi these kids are prime candidates. They simply give what they are craving, they provide a community for the isolated, the awkward, those without family. They offer support, they listen to their problems. They tell them what they want or need to hear. they echo the things they are seeing in the world and prey on the resentment and anger that they hold by validating it. But most importantly they provide a sense of a future. And that is more important to these young people than anything else. That they have a chance at a life is all that's needed to get them to join. 

So from a former trump supporter, someone who was fooled into believing these people. I say it again, our battle for a better world is only going to get worse, before it gets better. We must be there for our younger brothers and sisters. We must show them there is a light, that not all is lost. For if we fail to build them even a weak path to a better tomorrow over the raging rivers of uncertainty in the modern day.

War sucks and accidents happen. BOTH sides can and are frequently accused of barbaric acts. That said, in this specific clash, there is an aggressor (Hamass + Palestinian supporters -> most without a choice) and the defending victims (the State of Israel). Rather than blame the victims of October 7th, 2023, which started this specific conflict by the aggressors, try looking at it from a reasonable and realistic point of view.

America's undying (often unilateral) support of Israel is an effort to [ensure the return of Jesus Christ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/14/half-of-evangelicals-support-israel-because-they-believe-it-is-important-for-fulfilling-end-times-prophecy/).  We have consistently elected leaders that want to bring this about for long enough that this has essentially always been our policy.

The Bible states that Jesus Christ will not make his return until the Israelites are in control of all of Israel once again.  If you know anything about Christian Theology, you know that the return of Jesus Christ will occur during the end-times.

This is moot anyway because the reality is that Israel has scaled up operations to get aid into Gaza and now the hold up is with the UN. As of 3 days ago there were 600 aid trucks waiting for collection inside Gaza. As to the aid workers being killed, yes that is horrible. Mistakes happen in war.

The Romans held control of that land the longest, so if we're gonna play semantics, it is Italy's land to control, otherwise it's Egypt's based on the oldest records we believe that show who had control over the region.

When Israel was given their land by the British in 1947, it was Britain's land, not Israel's, not Palestine's, not Italy, Britain. They CHOSE to give PART of the land to the Jews and other pieces to other Muslim peoples. The Muslims/Arabs said fuck that and started a war because land that was GIVEN to them by BRITAIN, wasn't good enough. They failed to take out Israel and instead lost MORE land in the process. Had they won, then the land is theirs, but they didn't.

The people calling for this ""It's Palestine's land"" thing are truly a bunch of hypocrites and know nothing about history or choose to blatantly ignore it. You cannot have something stolen from you that wasn't yours to begin with. Just because you live somewhere does not make it yours. Thinking the age of manifest destiny is over is just silly. Russia is still doing it TODAY and Arab nations have attempted to for almost 100 years now and failed every single time and given more land to Israel. Pretty much every piece of land on earth was conquered at some point, most by many different nations throughout history. Many that still stand today are the direct result of that.

The US itself is the result of MULTIPLE countries over time fighting for the land. But I don't see people losing their shit and expecting the US government to give all the land to the Natives. Neither do I see it for Canada, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, or any other country in the world. For some stupid ass reason, it's just the ""in"" thing right now to hate on Israel and think that THEIR land, that they were given and then won when THEY were attacked first belongs to anyone else.

I've seen clips of jewish zionist people in israel literally admitting they are racist and they declare they have a right to be racist 

No, instead we have regular Jews, that are targeted in towns in countries like in france and the UK having thr star of david graffiti'd on to their house and garden walls, to identify that Jews live there, even when they don't support Israel (allegedly, yet lacking proof, in France at least they believe it to be a russian disinformation attack)

We see people supporting Palestine at rallies in London that are turned away for being gay and trans even though they are actively helping the cause of sharing and spreading the attempted at the genocide of Gaza or Gazans themselves saying they'd refuse aid if it knowingly came from people who were LBGTQ+ (Flags grabbed, people assaulted, told to leave)

So of course us supposedly plebian western liberals won't see this side of things seeing as the same jews worldwide that are hasidic, culturally Jewish or just straight up non-practicing and don't eat kosher or anything are still targeted all the same as the ones that are causing the problems. When you know people who are both Muslim and Jewish and both are ashamed to be socially practicing of either faith because of what zionistic Jews and radical Islamists have done to the world.

Try to think back to how muslims, Sikhs and so on were persecuted, the pure vitriol following 9/11 and what America did to U.S. Native born Japanese during WW2.


Jews that are NOT part of the problem are still being targeted. And we stand up for the muslims of Iran, and the muslims in China. But we're expected to not stand up for jews that aren't from Israel? 

This whole thing... Just everything, the fact that religions are supposed to be the more tolerant groups of people, the more moral and forgiving ones is sickening to me.

israelexposed,comment,kzgtrr0,ArchieMaximus,,"The fact you think Hamas has been shopping around for rockets, after Oct 7, is cartoonish levels of insanity. Any rockets they are able to get in, are through their tunnels at low-scale. 

They smuggle in some aid for their people and very little for their own rations. They‚Äôre incredibly out leveraged and stretched thin, but somehow are still able to resist the IDF. 

And you‚Äôre wrong about who is ruling Palestine. Hamas is an elected party, from an election that took place 18 years ago in Gaza, and its limited to the Gaza Strip. 

Then there‚Äôs the West Bank which is governed by Israel for 61%, and 39% by the PLO. So there‚Äôs no single government ruling Palestine, and it certainly isn‚Äôt Hamas.

israelexposed,post,1c36dhb,Helpful-Antelope-678,Extent to which sexual violence occurred on October 7th.,"This is a little similar to what I posted yesterday but I'm finding it frustrating to see the ""mass rape as a hamas military tool"" narrative pick up steam. I think The Intercept's article on the flaws of the NY Times ""Screams without Words"" spread some clarity on the propaganda used, however, rape having likely occurred on the 7th has been a big talking point for Zionists. 

&#x200B;

Based on my understanding, it seems likely that there was a significant quantity of sexual assault being used during and after October 7th. It just seems as though all of those acts are being pinned to Hamas, which I don't fundamentally believe to be true. It looks like regular citizens or members of Islamic Jihad may bare some of the responsibility.

&#x200B;

There still doesn't seem to be any proof of sexual violence happening outside of fringe individuals who, may or may not, be Hamas militants. This of course, does not justify the collective punishment imposed on Gaza's civilian population. I've been coming to terms with the brutality of sexual violence and its use on Israeli civilians while also acknowledging how it has been weaponized to kill Palestinians.

The victims were buried in a mass grave, which today serves as a car park for the nearby Tel Dor beach.

Never ever were there such restrictions as today.

I mean, the police tear down a poster from *jewish* protestors that had ""Jews against genocide"" written on it!?!?!

Wtf???

But I beg you guys, please do not confuse the cowardly and hypocritical behavior of the government with the mood and opinion of the German people.


The majority of the population is against the atrocities committed by Israel in Gaza and the West Bank, and more and more people are slowly realizing how long the Palestinians have been suffering there and what inhumanity has been shown to them all these decades.


You must understand that every German has already absorbed with their mother's milk that we Germans used to do unspeakably cruel things to the Jews 80 years ago (which is true), and that Jews are always ""the poor victims"" who have only ever been wronged and who must be protected in every way at any costs.


There is a documentary on German TV *every* day about the Second World War, Hitler or the Holocaust (on NTV, Phoenix, ZDFinfo, N24 doku or similar).


The immense guilt complex that Germans carry around with them is at least 95% responsible for the current behavior of the German government.

Unfortunately, they don't see that in their blind eagerness to do everything right this  time (regarding the Jews), they are making a mistake almost similar to the one they made back then: they are making themselves complicit in genocide.


But again: Thankfully, more and more germans understand, that the jews from the Holocaust, who were defenitly victims, as are palestinians today, have *nothing* to do with the fascist (!) zionists we see now often in Israel.

They see how jews (!) all over the world demonstrate against the opression and stand with palestinians, and I have the feeling that this gives them some kind of relief, like ""Ah, if even jews are protesting against the Israeli government, I can not be called an anti-semite if I do also!"".

It's maybe hard to understand for non germans, but that guilt complex and the fear to be called an anti-semite or a Nazi is constantly hovering over the heads of many people.

And what is maybe the most paradox part of all this, is, that of all people especially the right wingers, who like the AfD party (and who until 6 months ago were always talking about a hidden Jewish elite that controls everything üòÖ), *those* are the citizen who stand with Israel and the IDF.

israelexposed,post,1c2eixa,Helpful-Antelope-678,My issue with the Civilian-to-Combatant casualty ratio argument.,"Forgive me for preaching to the choir on this one. I've been kicked out of IsraelPalestine and this seems like a good community to test out my thoughts. Ever since Coleman Hughes went on Rogan I've been hearing a bunch of zionists arguing essentially that ""well 13,000 Hamas fighters are dead out of the 30,000 casualties. This means that Israel is actually doing a good job of limiting civilian casualties because the ratio is much lower than other wars"". 

1. Numbers don't really account for conduct. Regardless of the ratio of combatants-to-casualties, Israel is still intentionally targeting civilians at an extent that constitutes genocide.
2. I have trouble believing that the Hamas fighter casualty is at 13,000 because it seems increasingly likely that Israel is counting any male 18-64 as a Hamas combatant. My ""proof"" i guess is in Lavender and Where's Daddy AI targeting
3. I have trouble viewing this as a war. Israel is operating WAY outside the law of Proportionate Response and it doesn't even appear that Hamas as any significant military response to the Israeli invasion of Gaza. Therefore its dishonest to compare the Civilian-to-Combatant ratio to other actual wars, like Iraq or Ukraine. 

What am I missing here?",2024-04-12T17:08:36+00:00
israelexposed,comment,kz9gacd,jjojj07,,"You‚Äôre not missing anything - both sides use different numbers that suit their cause.

Here are some facts with sources to provide context. I‚Äôve used IDF, Hamas and UN reviewed numbers to provide a range.

The numbers are still damning for the IDF

Sources below

The current estimated Palestinian death toll in Gaza is 33,091, with over 76,000 injured*

Hamas reports approximately 6,000 combatants killed. IDF claims 10,000 - 12,000. The actual number likely lies somewhere in between

**The historical civilian casualty ratio for modern conflicts (ie since the 1900s) is historically on a 1:1 to 2:1 ratio** (ie in roughly equal numbers to up to 2 civilian casualties for every 1 combatant casualty). This is broadly consistent from WWI through to every major conflict except those outlined below.

**Based on the casualty numbers above, the Gaza war civilian casualty ratio inflicted by the IDF on Palestine is approx 12:1.** It ranges depending on the source from:
- 17:1 (Palestinian account)
- 8:1 (Israeli account)

Even just counting deaths (and not all casualties) the civilian death ratio is approx 4:1

There are a few modern conflicts that have seen a civilian casualty ratio even approaching these sort of numbers:
* Chechen wars: with a c. 7.6:1 civilian casualty ratio (approx 53k civilians to 7k fighters) where Russia was condemned by the UN for undertaking ethnic cleansing
* Kosovo war with an approx 5:1 civilian casualty ratio where Yugoslavia was condemned for a campaign of ethnic cleansing
* Lebanon War: conducted by Israel with a civilian casualty ratio of 5:1 reported by the International Red Cross 
* Gulf war conducted by the US and allies with a civilian death ratio of c4:1.

See the pattern? These outliers have involved either ethnic cleansing, the US or the IDF.

Wars analysed include the Mexican War, WWI, WWII, Vietnam, Korea, Chechnya, Kosovo, Gulf, Lebanon, Balkan, 2nd Intifada, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria/ISIS, Yemen, Ukrainian, Gaza 23)


**The current war in Gaza exceeds these numbers (even by the IDF count)**


Note - there are a lot of sources that cite that 90% of all war casualties are civilians (or inversely, 10% of casualties are combatants). It is critical to understand that this oft cited metric uses a different measurement. It uses deaths, casualties, *internally displaced civilians and refugees.*

If we apply this same metric to Gaza, then you need to add the approx 1.2m people currently in Rafah that have been displaced (approx 1.4-1.5m currently less the c 200k Rafah residents (171k as at 2017 census))

Using this metric, then over 99.99% of the Gaza war are civilian casualties, or inversely, only 0.006% of Palestinian casualties are combatants.**

 ** (and this is using the higher IDF numbers for Hamas fighter casualties and assuming that all remaining 20k of Hamas fighters are in Rafah to reduce the displaced civilian count in Rafa). 


 * Note: these Palestinian casualty numbers are thought to be underreported due to the number of people missing that are yet to be counted amongst casualties.

We know they've bombed their own hostages from afar. We know they've shot them up close, even when they wave flags and plead to live. We've seen them shoot and drone unarmed men. We've seen them snipe unarmed people trying to reach aid drops. We've seen them execute prisoners.

We *know* all of this. It's fact. So either despite all this, Israel is ***somehow***  magically out-performing every other modern military with this historically low, godly, exceptional casualty ratio...

Or, Israel is consistent, and their constantly proven fast-and-loose military protocol has an equally fast-and-loose concept of what constitutes a combatant.

There's been around 33,000 people killed (officially) and around 70% (23,100) have been women and children consistently throughout (although I couldn't find a recent breakdown), so that leaves 9,900 males 18+. They claim the ratio is around 1.5 civilians to each ""terrorist"", so 13,000 ""terrorists"" means 19,500 civilians, which totals 32,500 making it clear they're using the same total casualties.

766 civilians were killed on October 7th and 373 security forces. Based on these numbers that's a 2:1 civilian to casualty ratio.  Since October 7th far more members of Israeli security forces have been killed than civilians.  Therefore the ratio is better than 2:1.

israelexposed,comment,kzhmwz9,Helpful-Antelope-678,,"I read through your comments but I'll respond to them here. Lol i had to pull out the laptop for this one. I think your friend is pretty indoctrinated into Israel and probably has fond memories there. As a result it might be hard for them to look past common Israeli talking points.

  
1. Like you already mentioned, the hospital accusation from Israel was that Hamas was using a hospital as a ""command center"" and there was no proof of that whatsoever. The closest thing to evidence was a photo of a bunch of guns allegedly hidden them. Let's assume that the IDF didn't plant those (which they very well could have). That brings me to my next point.

  
2. It is true that a school or hospital can lose protected status if military operations are happening BUT the burden of proof is on the attacker and the attacker is obligated to give a warning to civilians. Israel has failed on both of these accounts. But, for arguments sake, let's assume that the accusations of schools and hospitals are true.

  
3. There's a principle of international law called Proportionate Response. This means that you can only get away with killing civilians if the military advantage is big enough to justify it. So like if it's a huge Hamas commander being killed in residential area, you might be able to get away with come collateral damage. But killing a whole family just to get one SUSPECTED rank-and-file Hamas member is unacceptable (Israel does this all the time). Similarly, you can't justify bombing a hospital or ambulance and KILLING CIVILIANS just because you THINK there might be weapons on there. This brings me to human shields.

  
4. Gaza is one of the most population dense places on earth. It's a open-air prison of Israel's design so of course Hamas fighters will be within vicinity to civilians. This does not mean that Israel can just indiscriminately fire. Hamas isn't a bunch of supervillains dressed up as stereotypical terrorists out of a Jeff Dunham special. These guys PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS who are largely orphans that have never been outside of Gaza. It's hard to believe that they have some grand masterful plan to ""enmesh themselves so they can use as many human shields as possible"". Now there is an argument to be made that Hamas, in some ways, benefits from civilians deaths but imo that does not prove the ""Human Shields"" theory.

  
5. I'll concede that some of the accusations against Hamas launching rockets out of schools are plausible. But to point number 3, the extent of the accusations and the threat these shitty homemade rockets pose to Israel is NOWHERE NEAR the level of danger posed to justify killing 4000 STUDENTS. Especially since they've targeted much more schools than have been accused of being near launch sites.

  
6. In regards to the Nova Festival, it appears as though Hamas and other Gazan orgs/civilians, had planned to break out of the containment zone and didn't realize the festival was there. From there they, without a doubt, DELIBERATELY ATTACKED CIVILIANS at the festival. It would be foolish to deny that Hamas went after civilians, including taking hostages with the hope that there would be a hostage exchange. In regards to your point about the military base, the festival was near kibbutzim that were housing IDF soldiers.  
  
7. Hamas definitely carried out atrocities during October 7th. Targeting civilians and taking hostages are both objectively war crimes. HOWEVER the SA accusations are extremely dubious and that's a whole other threads worth of stuff to talk about. That being said, I WOULD NEVER CONDEMN THEM. It would be like condemning water for boiling when heated over a stove.

Hasbara can control the Western message when it's only through Whitehouse briefings, but when Saul over here is boasting about raping and murdering children on tiktok, it's impossible to get in front of that message. For all the liberal politicians arguing that Palestinian propaganda is the reason people are turning against Israel, it's seeing the sociopathic boasting about dead children that's really turning the stomachs of average Westerners.

Krstiƒá, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY, located in The Hague, ruled that the massacre of the enclave's male inhabitants constituted genocide, a crime under international law. The ruling was also upheld by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 2007. The forcible transfer and abuse of between 25,000 and 30,000 Bosniak Muslim women, children and elderly which accompanied the massacre was found to constitute genocide, when accompanied with the killings and separation of the men.""

The actual definition of a genocide is, ""Any of the following acts ""committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group"": killing members of the group, causing them serious bodily or mental harm, imposing living conditions intended to destroy the group, preventing births, and forcibly transferring children out of the group.

israelexposed,comment,kz5f4qj,lightiggy,,"[Montagu's dissent](https://original.antiwar.com/srichman/2023/12/05/jewish-dissent-on-the-balfour-declaration/)

Montagu responded to the cabinet in a memorandum titled ""The Anti-Semitism of the Present Government"". In his memo, he said were it up to him, he'd be very tempted to ban the entire Zionist movement in British territory. As he saw it, the Balfour Declaration would jeopardize the status of Jews in England and elsewhere. He said it implied that British Jews were less British than other Britons, when they should be viewed as Jewish Britons. Montagu said non-Jewish Zionists heavily underestimated the unpopularity of Zionism among Jewish Britons. He said the actual territory was too small for colonization anyway, even if one theoretically expelled the natives.

>""I assert that there is not a Jewish nation. The members of my family, for instance, who have been in this country for generations, have no sort or kind of community of view or of desire with any Jewish family in any other country beyond the fact that they profess to a greater or less degree the same religion. It is no more true to say that a Jewish Englishman and a Jewish Moor are of the same nation than it is to say that a Christian Englishman and a Christian Frenchman are of the same nation: of the same race, perhaps, traced back through the centuries ‚Äî through centuries of the history of a peculiarly adaptable race. The Prime Minister and M. Briand are, I suppose, related through the ages, one as a Welshman and the other as a Breton, but they certainly do not belong to the same nation.""

Lord Curzon, who became the Foreign Secretary only two years after the Balfour Declaration, agreed, saying it risked future ethnic tensions. He said that using Zionist logic, the British would have better claims to parts of France than Zionists did to Palestine.

Nearly 30 years later, in 1945, the Labour Party won the elections. They supported Zionism even more than the Conservatives, who'd shelved plans to partition Palestine after Lord Moyne, a close friend of Winston Churchill, was assassinated by Zionist terrorists in November 1944. During their campaign, they'd promised to establish a Jewish state in Palestine and outright advocated for population transfers, stating, ""Let the Arabs be encouraged to move out as the Jews move in."" After taking power, they voted to repeal the White Paper of 1939, which would've effectively forced the Zionists to share the land via heavy restrictions on Jewish immigration and land purchases. Zionists, including the paramilitaries, awaited the declaration of a Jewish state in Palestine. After weeks of waiting, the paramilitaries ran out of patience and launched a spree of bombings on November 1, 1945, killing two Britons and four Palestinians. Yishuv leaders blamed the attacks on Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, saying he was taking too long to lift the immigration restrictions.

>""Every one of these outrages had been carefully planned and kept secret so that they should operate simultaneously.""

To their surprise, Bevin lashed back at them.

About two weeks later, Bevin shocked the Yishuv by publicly announcing a full-180 on British policy in Palestine. Outraging Zionists worldwide, he vetoed the conference's decision, broke the party's election promise to establish a Jewish state, and said he'd follow through on the White Paper. When he bluntly rejected all of the Yishuv's pleas and went, ""No, I don't care about your compromise to shrink the size of your ethnostate; you will share the land, end of story,"" tensions rapidly escalated. Bevin, who'd received free rein from the prime minister, wanted to protect British hegemony in the Middle East, but also thought the Balfour Declaration had been a terrible idea, fearing a ""racial state"". As for where displaced Jews would live, he said they should stay.

>""We cannot accept the view that the Jews should be driven out of Europe and should not be permitted to live again in these countries without discrimination and contribute their ability and talent towards rebuilding the prosperity of Europe.""

Further angering Zionists, Bevin not only refused to back down against intense pressure from the Zionist lobby in Britain and the United States, but instead went on the attack. He accused the Jewish Agency for Palestine of intentionally not using all available immigration certificates afforded to them under the White Paper during the war. There had been 2,000 unused certificates left at the end of the war. This refusal, he claimed, was part of a ""political lever"" with which they'd hoped to use to influence British policies. According to David Ben-Gurion, what Bevin chose to do next, however, amounted to a declaration of ""war against Zionism.""

>""This,"" he remarked, ""when so much is said about the suffering of Jews in Europe.""

Bevin started deploying thousands of British soldiers to Palestine.

Out of patience, but faced with an opponent who'd easily crush them in a straight fight, the Yishuv dropped their facade of being peaceful and reasonable, instead screaming and whining about how they were being oppressed. When Bevin explicitly confirmed that the Mandate would become a Palestinian state, Zionists rioted in Tel Aviv. Mandate security forces ordered them to disperse. When they refused, the police made baton charges against them. When that didn't work, they shot over 60 rioters, five of them fatally, put the entire city under curfew, and brought in armored cars to patrol the streets. The Yishuv had hoped for a Jewish state without much effort, but was now faced with an unexpected new obstacle, a highly influential politician with a spine (one struggles to find them these days).

So, a war broke out between the British and the Zionists.

Whenever ships of illegal Jewish immigrants sailed for Palestine, they were intercepted, boarded, and the passengers detained. Due to World War II and many of the Zionists being white Europeans, British security forces were softer on them than they would've been against Arabs, Asians, or Africans. Still, as seen by their suppression of the riots, they were willing to use force. As the war went on, American and British Zionists lobbied furiously to get Bevin to stop resisting, only for him to keep sending thousands of more troops to Palestine. At first remaining silent since a personal friend, [Lord Moyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Guinness,_1st_Baron_Moyne), had been murdered by Zionist terrorists in 1944, Winston Churchill started attacking Bevin's policies in late 1946. He could not understand why so many soldiers who could've been sent to keep India as a British colony were instead being diverted to Palestine to crack down on Zionist terrorism.

>""To abandon India, with all the dire consequences that would follow therefrom, but to have a war with the Jews in order to give Palestine to the Arabs amid the execration of the world, appears to carry incongruity of thought and policy to levels which have rarely been attained in human history.""

By April 1947, the war was reaching its peak.

Bevin, now viewed by the Zionist movement as akin to Hitler, had deployed 100,000 soldiers and another 20,000 police officers to Palestine. Internment camps were established in Cyprus to intern tens of thousands of illegal immigrants. Martial law was declared, with curfew violators being shot on sight. Collective punishment was employed, with mass fines being imposed and places of entertainment shut down. The Mandate authorities stopped bluffing and executed convicted terrorists. This time, however, they weren't executing Palestinians, but four Irgun members, who went to the gallows singing Hatikvah, the Zionist anthem. MI6 bombed ships intended for illegal immigrants before they could be loaded, damaging two and disabling another. As the soldiers and police became increasingly frustrated with folks not complying with [very simple orders](https://imgur.com/a/EBFywaE), they held back less and less. In one instance, Bill Bernstein, an American volunteer, tried to stop British soldiers from taking the wheel of a ship, only for them to immediately beat him to death. Churchill continued to express confusion.

>""The government, always ready to scuttle from any difficulty, to run away from anything that looks large and appears fierce, has evidently cast away our mighty Indian empire."" But in Palestine, he said, there was a different process at work in the minds of the government: ""There we have to go on fighting at all costs. There are four times as many troops in Palestine as in India. We must carry on this squalid war of terrorism. We are fighting the Jews in order to give the country to the Arabs.""

Meanwhile, in the United States, American Zionists ""pledged full-fledged support"" for the Haganah's ""war of resistance"" in Palestine. With Bevin being a brick wall, they instead turned towards their own government for help. On November 12, 1945, 1,000 rabbis marched on the Capitol, demanding an end to the war and the immediate release of ""all Jewish patriots"" from British ""concentration camps"" in North Africa (the ""camps"" held hundreds of Irgun and Lehi terrorists). Bevin's unapologetic attitude only further enraged them. In June 1946, he bluntly questioned the motives of non-Jewish American Zionists who objected to his war in Palestine.

>""There has been agitation in the United States, and particularly in New York, for 100,000 Jews to be put in Palestine. I hope I will not be misunderstood in America if I say that this was proposed by the purest of motives. They did not want too many Jews in New York.""",2024-04-11T22:45:23+00:00

israelexposed,post,1c1jfbe,Abdul205,‚ÄúWhat democratic state for Palestine?‚Äù‚ÄîA conference on decolonization," 

https://preview.redd.it/r6lfemw1nvtc1.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=57101a9c3b8847351240b35169b9d575ce33de60

The Decolonization Conference at ‚ÄúMaison de la Famille‚Äù in Brussels on the 15th of March had four speakers: Naji al-Khatib, ODSI coordinator, Ilan Pappe, prominent historian on the Israeli occupation and policies towards Palestine and Palestinians, Eitan Bronstein, the founder of Zochrot and Suheil Yassin, also an ODSI coordinator.

The four speakers tackled various themes related to decolonization, specifically as it involves Palestine; they all broadly had agreement on the necessity of the dismantlement of the state of Israel, but broadly broached Israel as a settler colonial state (with an emphasis on its strategic defeat following the ongoing genocide in Gaza) that had and will continue until its decline both expanding and persecuting Palestinians, rejecting granting them the ability to possess self-determination.

Suheil was the first to speak; his speech was set on the precedent established by Zionism ‚Äì namely in how it essentially guaranteed a sort of moral absolutism to people that had once been the victims of genocide to themselves commit it, and how this morally corrupts Western countries as fascist movements across the world become more emboldened by Zionist fascist crimes being supported by Western countries. Israel is not unique in the international community for this ‚Äì Rwanda‚Äôs actions in the eastern DRC are another example of such actions ‚Äì but it is unique in that its broadcast like never before online creating a doublespeak for established politicians and radicalization of people all across the world. The precedent being set is one where war crimes are acceptable so long as the country in question is allied with Western interests.

Here, Suheil emphasized that rather than Israel be a country that naturally fit into the rest of the region, Israel instead acts as a sort of outpost of Europe in the Middle East ‚Äì an example being how Israelis never naturally fit into the region nor are interested in doing so, being able to engage in visa-free travel and mostly politically and economically dealing with Western countries rather than the Middle East. Perhaps the most damning thing about Israel as a country is that it impacts the behavior of its neighbors; it sets a precedent that politicizes sectarian identity explicitly. Lebanon, a country partially specifically carved out of what was formerly a larger Syrian political entity, was created as a Maronite nation-state with the explicit purpose of dividing and conquering two minorities (Maronites and Jews) in the region against an Arab/Muslim ‚Äúhorde‚Äù. Similar trends can be seen in Syria, a country that barred Kurds from citizenship until recently and explicitly discriminates against various minorities, Jordan, a country where Transjordanians benefit from stronger access to the public sector than Palestinians, and Egypt, where Copts are explicitly barred from employment in various fields.

Eitan‚Äôs focus was on memory politics and how the Nakba and its erasure and denial had corrupted Israeli Jewish public consciousness; the Nakba is often downplayed next to the Holocaust, and this puts Israelis in a position where empathy is promoted for themselves above anyone else ‚Äì he spoke extensively on the necessity on land redistribution and on outlining a path for how to organize a single state from the river to the sea, as to not repeat the mistakes of South Africa, and that it‚Äôs necessary to make sure that refugees returning to Palestine should have ample opportunity to economically prosper and excel that had been granted to Israeli Jews for decades.

Naji‚Äôs particularly questioned: ‚ÄúWhat place for words, ideas, debates in the context of genocide and barbarism today in Gaza?‚Äù and answered that the proposal for a single democratic state is the only possible outcome to stop the massacres and this new Nakba in Gaza. Naji explained that our organization, the One Democratic State Initiative, sees itself as a continuation of a Palestinian legacy that began in 1943, when the ""National Liberation League"" opened the prospect of secular and democratic Palestinian statehood for all its citizens, a perspective confirmed by the Palestinian National Council of 1968 for whom this was the final objective of the liberation struggle. He also explained that ODS is not a binational state, or a ‚Äúdemocratization of Israel‚Äù, or a ‚Äúmerger‚Äù between Israel and Palestine, or a Palestinian-Israeli confederation.‚Äù Rather, the ODS Initiative integrates a more Palestinian vision concerning the ODS within the framework of these 3 founding principles of Palestinian national consciousness, namely: Liberation, return of Palestinian refugees and a secular democratic state for all inhabitants of Palestine from the river to the sea.

Ilan‚Äôs speech ranged on how Zionism and by extension Israel as a state are in the early stages of inevitable complete collapse; he emphasized that Israel as a state, while creating a successful Other in Palestinians (as well as Arabs by large) has failed to create a cohesive national identity, with clear political divides among Israeli Jews on both ethnic and sectarian lines ‚Äì this has already culminated in the collapse of stability in the current political order in Israel, and with other more noteworthy economic trends (this was a point of disagreement between him and Eitan, who though Israel‚Äôs economy has somewhat weathered the storm) and a revival of widespread Arab and Palestinian animosity against Israel, he sees it as unlikely for Israel to weather the storm.

However, he cautioned that unfortunately, the nightmare and brutality will be at its apex specifically before the dawn, and while he‚Äôs confident that this dawn is coming, he emphasized the necessity to prepare for the day after ‚Äì he emphasized the necessity for Palestinians, especially those in the diaspora, to create a new PLO that can act as a new order on the ground, so a vacuum in the day after can be filled up by a government that can lead Palestinians to a better future.

To conclude, the call for ODS isn‚Äôt simply a call for solving the colonization of Palestine but also for regional reform and change; it proposes having a country in the region that rather than exacerbate sectarian tension ‚Äì both Jews and Palestinians have their presence and identities securitized and under constant scrutiny in the region, and there can never be a call for desecuritized borders so long as identity is so explicitly politicized in a repeat of the political state present in Lebanon or Iraq or Bosnia ‚Äì people can never be happy, including the supposed beneficiaries of the State of Israel, Jews, because their presences are frequently under threat and attack. As such, Israel‚Äôs dismantlement ‚Äì particularly because so much of Western foreign policy and approach to the region, including the war on Iraq, is centered around safeguarding it ‚Äì is a necessity both for the safety of Palestinians and the safety of Jewish populations that rather than benefit from the exploitation, would simply rather live as a natural part of the region.",2024-04-11T16:28:21+00:00

Karpin describes in new detail how Edward Teller, the monomaniacal father of the H-bomb, visited Israel six times between 1964 and 1967 -- the period when Israel passed the atomic threshold -- and unabashedly urged his friends there to build the bomb. All the while, Teller's government was negotiating the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which Israel has never signed. Karpin intimates that Teller assisted Israel in designing sophisticated nuclear weapons.‚Äù  https://carnegieendowment.org/2006/02/19/sampson-option-pub-18045

israelexposed,comment,kz44dgg,unga-unga,,"I personally do not think that can be done. Cause there are kinda two possible narratives to explain the current situation, with all of the information that is out there (I can share more book list lmk)....

Either Israel is America's satellite nation, and a vehicle for proxy warfare and in the words of President Biden from 1986... ""Were there not an Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel..."" In this scenario, the policies that we see as pro-israel are in fact designed to be self-serving, and basically an exchange is taking place that those in power see as proportionate to services rendered... 

Or... 

A thorough and complete agency capture has taken place, fascilitated by men like Allen Dulles, J. E. Hoover, Meyer Lansky and the National Crime Syndicate, the Cohn family, James J Angleton, Frank Wisner, Richard Helms, William Casey, several top bankers, and many others, leading in a direct line of association to almost every president, and implying a situation of near complete control by a small group of mostly unelected officals... and if THIS were the case, to cease supporting Israel would require dismantling the CIA, firing everyone who works for the FBI, kicking out half or more of congress, and any number of other impossibilities which would require executive authority that boarders on totalitarian. As well as a president who actually wants to carry it out, so, zero chance. 

So basically, the answer is either NO or double-super-extra-deluxe-mega-NO.

It's either the tail that wags the dog... or... we are mistaken about what the dog is, and what the tail is, and the idea of one being the other's proxy is just a mistake about the architecture of power. If that is the case, not only is the differentiation between Israel and the US a moot point, but our idea of the US government as a democratic institution is fundamentally false.

If you are worried about the later possibility, and are looking for a level voice of reason amongst the tripe and filth of antisemitism and wacky shitbrained con-artists that bandwagon on anything that serves their own prejudices... I definitely recommend reading those books by Whitney Webb, and listen to her interviews... and the books she references in hers forms a nice list that passes the ""fact or crap"" test.",2024-04-11T18:24:19+00:00

Knowing where you saw it and in what context.  And you wonder why I'm calling you out??  You are as disgusting as the people committing these acts of atrocity.    
  
That video is from one of the Muslim hate groups you participate in on goresee and watchpeopledie.  Where you commented, I am paraphrasing since it's not right in front me of but ""That's a great crush!  What is it?"" 

  
 You have now commented equally on synagogue shootings, Palestinians being mauled by equipment, a Muslim being ripped from his home and executed, minority children being beaten; you cheer them on.   As long as it's violent it's equal to you.  You DO love violence.   I actually have the screen caps someone sent of this particular post as well.    I wonder...how could the police you claim persecuted you have seen the enjoyment of violence against Jews and Christians but NOT against Muslims?  Or are you conveniently leaving that out of your narrative?  It all makes sense now.  It was your enjoyment of violence.  Period.  YOU left out part of the story.  Since you deny trying to get firearms the night you were removed.  And all the screen caps prove what occurred.   I will say, it seems your all time favorite videos are mass killings and animal torture.  Vs these one offs.  Those don't seem to do it for you.  No one normal can watch any of this and not be outraged.

You are spreding hate against Islam while pretending you care about it for clout.  You made posts throughout Ramadan about Buddhism.  About how Islam stole it's religion from them.  While the rest of us prayed Taraweeh so thankful we could do it without being killed; we packed supplies for gaza, raised funds, made sacrifices for our cause and our people.  You posted a variety of hate speech against Islam unless it served to pad your pockets or your ego.    
  
You went too far.    
  
Let's make sure any clout you get for being pro Palestine is tainted by a showing of the real you.  You have not done one single thing for Palestine.  YOU are spreading violent images for sport.  These are people's REAL children.  Their parents who aren't ever coming home.  And their homes?  Gone.  Unlike you who spent Ramadan eating normally and playing video games with not one sacrifice and committing shirk, these families lost EVERYTHING.   

LOOK at these images.  LOOK AT THEM and not get off on them.  They could be you.  Those could be MY children.  This is not some movie set.  Go take your performance of pretending like you care elsewhere.  You did not set foot in a mosque or meet a Muslim until you wanted to use it as a reason for clout from your umpteenth involuntary hold.  THEN you make tiktoks.  And excuses.  Go enjoy your false idols.  And false sympathy.

India (and Bangladesh) have such huge populations. The majority of white Americans seem to be Pro Israel, but I do not see anyone being racist against them in such a blatant way. 

I hate how racism against Indians is so normalized. Just the other day, I was called a terrorist because the random guy who said it thought I was a Muslim. I hope people realize that when a racist POS sees a brown person, they will automatically think they're Muslim or Middle Eastern. 

Using a term like Pajeet only perpetuates and normalizes this behavior. It's a derogatory term thrown at all Indians, even Indian Muslims! 

Trust me, a racist person will not care to ask what religion you follow before being racist lmao. They see us all firstly as brown and Muslim (even if we aren't all Muslim).

It's an exercise in liberal aesthetics and thinly veiled narcissism. It is only concerned with 'liberation' insofar as it serves as a vehicle for the self-enrichment of bourgeois white women. These types are the ones telling women of color, indigenous women, and anyone who isn't American that they're concerns and issues must be put to the side less it threaten the expansion of the narrow bourgeois interests of the white woman, and that progress is represented by women having more corporate power and a greater role in the security state a la Victoria Nuland and her ilk.

Keep in mind that race is not a legitimate biological or taxonomic concept, and does not have a coherent set of principles regarding who it is even applied to. It is entirely a social construct created in order to arbitrarily discriminate against oppressed peoples with a pseudoscientific justification of organized barbarism.

It is now used more broadly to refer to ""people with recent European ancestry"", which is quite nebulous and exclusionary of the descendents of people of color who have resided in Europe for centuries.

Women's suffrage, the Civil Rights movement, Social Security, welfare for women and children, section 8, the disabilities act, affirmative action, abortion rights, same-sex marriage, etc were all victories won by political movements and coalitions of identity groups. 

Identity is inherently political. Every individual is an intersection of overlapping identities, their gender, their race, their socioeconomic class, their sexual identity, their religion, etc. Each category of identity comes with it's own relative privileges and struggles thety define the individual and collective experience of what it means to live with them. 

Class reductionism is nothing more than a tactic by oppressors to dismiss and ignore the concept of equity and universal human rights. If we were to say, achieve liberation of indigenous peoples from all foreign oppression, would that also undo the oppression of misogyny and homophobia? Would achieving deinstitutionalization of homophobia in our legal and social systems offer the same freedom from oppression to trans and nonbinary persons? No. We saw this in the civil rights movement with how Black women still suffered under misogynist conservatives in their own communities despite the gains in voting rights and desegregation.

Each identity group has it's own particular history and requires it's own particular solutions. This is what is recognized by the concept of intersectionality, which is more descriptive than prescriptive, similar to Marxism.

Like the term ""feminism"" and ""socialism"", ""identity politics"" is a term that's been deliberately bastardized by conservatives and counter-revolutionaries to subvert it's salience and power to bring actual democratic change to our societies. Class solidarity, recognizing that social classes are multilateral, is the greatest weapon against tyranny. 

How can we develop class solidarity while denying the lived experience of our allies? How can we every hope to build a durable and expansive movement towards justice while telling marginalized persons to shut up and sit down? Identity politics is only disturbing to those who do not suffer due to their identity.

 ‚ÄúCase Summary

The Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development (HLF), a Texas-based charity with a mission of providing humanitarian aid in Palestine, was the largest Muslim charity in the United States until its closure in December of 2001. HLF had been legally operating for over a decade before it was designated and shut down by the Bush administration three months after 9/11. Its former officials were convicted of providing material support for terrorism on retrial in November 2008, and received sentences ranging from 15 to 65 years. The case, the evidence, the procedure, and the convictions all highlight the precarious legal position of U.S. nonprofits trying to carry out humanitarian missions.‚Äù",2024-04-11T02:49:52+00:00

For Israel their only founding principle is a Jewish state. Meaning anyone who is not Jewish will be deprived of their natural right to live. It's actually the exact opposite of the American founding principle. If you don't meet an extremely strict criteria (being a jew) then you will never be seen as a citizen let alone a human being. 

Zionism is founded on the following.

1. If you are not a Jew we will remove you or kill you.

2. We will expand our territory because everything belongs to us.

3. If Anti-Zionist Jews question us we will terrorize them so they run into the arms of the state.

4. We are the chosen people. Everyone else is second to us.

israelexposed,comment,kyp40y1,Ameer-ul-Momineen,,"Look into the history of Hamas, at a time when the PLO had unanimous support from the Palestinian masses and the problem was being exposed as a forced theft of Palestinian land by the Zionists, Israel created and funded Hamas (trained by CIA and Mossad) in order to create a divide, and also to convert the entire conflict of land occupation into a religious conflict (and to paint muslims/islam as terrorists). It may be a different story now on who controls Hamas, but you can't ignore the history, it was never a resistance force against Israel, when it was created by Israel itself.

Also note who benefited from the half-assed attack of Oct 7. Not an inch changed for Israel. But on the other side it gave Israel a free killing spree card to butcher tens of thousands of children and displace millions of people, and now it's preparing for the final slaughter of the 1.5m people in Rafah, to finally complete its occupation of 100% of the Palestinian land, after which it can focus on the expansion into Egypt and surrounding territories. No one in Palestine wanted the Oct 7 attack, and no one wants Hamas to continue with the hostage situation (although to be fair, Israel has purposely killed more of its own hostages than what Hamas retains, its just an excuse by Israel, everyone knows what the real intention is).",2024-04-09T00:14:21+00:00

She added that before the attack, ‚ÄúWe believed that there are no bad people ‚Äî only people who have it bad. But there are bad people.‚Äù
Agam described one incident in which the family was staying at a school where ‚Äúa nice woman welcomed us and offered us water and arranged a place for us to sleep,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI turned to my mother and said ‚ÄòThere are good people in the world.'‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd five minutes later, they shot a barrage of rockets from the school [into Israel] and everyone was shouting ‚ÄòAllahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar‚Äô and I told her, ‚ÄòForget what I said, they‚Äôre all the same.'‚Äù
‚ÄúWe will never forgive and we will never show any kind of empathy towards these people,‚Äù Agam said. ‚ÄúIf we previously believed that there was a chance for peace, we‚Äôve lost all faith in these people, especially after we were there and among the population.‚Äù

with Jewish majority. My readers have a general
idea of the history of colonisation in other countries. I suggest that they consider all the precedents with which they are acquainted and see whether there is one solitary instance
of any colonisation being carried on with the consent of the native population. There is no such precedent. The native populations, civilised or uncivilised, have always stubbornly resisted the colonists, irrespective of whether they were civilised or savage.""


Ze'ev Jabotinsky, in 'The Iron Wall':

""[The] iron law of every colonizing movement, a law which knows of no exceptions, a law which existed in all times and under all circumstances. If you wish to colonize a land in which people are already living, you must provide a garrison on your behalf. Or else, give
up your colonization, for without an armed force
which will render physically impossible any attempts to destroy or prevent this colonization, colonization is impossible, not 'difficult', not
dangerous' but IMPOSSIBLE! Zionism is a colonizing adventure and therefore it stands or falls by the question of armed force. It is important to build, it is important to speak Hebrew, but, unfortunately, it is even more
important to be able to shoot - or else I am through with playing at colonization.""


Chaim Weizmann, first President of Israel (1949-1952):

""What we wanted was a British Protectorate.
Jews all over the world trusted England. They
knew that law and order would be established by British rule, and that under it, Jewish colonizing activities and cultural development
would not be interfered with. We could therefore look forward to a time when we would be strong enough to claim a measure of self-government.""


Chaim Weizmann:

""Partition might be only a temporary arrangement for the next twenty to twenty-five
years.""


David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first Prime Minister (1948-1953) in a 1938 speech to the Zionist Executive:

""[I am] satisfied with part of the country, but on the basis of the assumption that after we build up a strong force following the establishment
of the state, we will abolish the partition of the country and we will expand to the whole Land of Israel.""


David Ben-Gurion:

""The acceptance of partition does not commit us to renounce Transjordan: one does not demand from anybody to give up his vision.
We shall accept a state in the boundaries fixed today, but the boundaries of Zionist aspirations are the concern of the Jewish people and no
external factor will be able to limit them.""


David Ben-Gurion:

""If I were an Arab leader, I would never sign an
agreement with Israel. It is normal; we have taken their country. It is true God promised it to us, but how could that interest them? Our God is not theirs. There has been Anti-Semitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They see but one thing: we have come and we have stolen their country. Why would they
accept that?""


David Ben-Gurion:

""If I knew that it was possible to save all the children of Germany by transporting them to England, and only half by transferring them to
the Land of Israel, I would choose the latter, for before us lies not only the numbers of these children but the historical reckoning of the
people of Israel.""


David Ben-Gurion:

""Let us not ignore the truth among ourselves... politically we are the aggressors and they defend themselves... The country is theirs, because they inhabit it, whereas we want to come here and settle down, and in their view we
want to take away from them their country.""


David Ben-Gurion:

""It's not a matter of maintaining the status quo.
We have to create a dynamic state, oriented towards expansion.""


Yosef Weitz, director, Jewish National Fund Land Settlement Committee
(1932-1948):

""It must be clear that there is no room in the country for both peoples...If the Arabs leave it, the country will become wide and spacious for us...The only solution is a Land of Israel..without Arabs...There is no way but to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighboring countries, to transfer all of them, save
perhaps for [the Palestinian Arabs of] Bethlehem, Nazareth, and the old
Jerusalem. Not one village must be left, not one tribe.""


Moshe Dayan, Israeli Defense Minister (1967-1974), talking in an address to the Technion (Institute of Technology), Haifa (as quoted in Ha'aretz, 4 April 1969)

""We came here to a country that was populated by Arabs and we at building here a Hebrew, a Jewish state. Jewish villages were built in the place of Arab villages. You do not even know the names
of these Arab villages, and I do not blame you because geography books no longer exist, not only do the books not exist, the Arab villages are not there either. Nahlal arose in the place of Mahlul; Kibbutz Gvat in the place of Jibta; Kibbutz Sarid in the place of Huneifis; and Kefar Yehushu'a in the place of Tal al-Shuman. There is not one single place built in this country that did not have a former Arab population.""


Moshe Dayan, talking about the expulsion of the Arab population:

""I hope they all go. If we could achieve the departure of three hundred thousand without
pressure, that would be a great blessing!


Moshe Dayan speaking about Palestinians in the occupied
territories:

""We have no solution, you shall continue to live like dogs, and whoever wishes
may leave, and we will see where this process leads.""


Moshe Dayan's opening statement in his eulogy for Ro'i Rothberg, a kibbutz security officer killed near the¬†Gaza Strip in 1956:

""Early yesterday morning Roi was murdered. The quiet of the spring morning dazzled him and he did not see those waiting in ambush for him, at the edge of the furrow. Let us not cast the blame on the murderers today. Why should we declare their burning hatred for us? For eight years they have been sitting in the¬†refugee camps in Gaza, and before their eyes we have been transforming the lands and the villages, where they and their fathers dwelt, into our estate.""",2024-04-10T19:37:38+00:00

Protests started pretty soon actually.

Compare that to France. There was a sanctioned candlelight vigil held in front of the Eiffel tower (which was lit up in Israel's blue and white) with police protection. The same week, there was an unsanctioned Palestinian protest in the street where riot police arrived and teargassed the protesters and beat some of them with batons.

Also compare to Germany. I saw Israeli flags publicly flown on masts in public squares, hanging from people's apartment balconies, etc. Nothing for Palestine except for graffiti. Talking to one local briefly (and talking to another local in Salzburg, Austria), the people at the time were afraid to even mention Palestine because it would get them in trouble with the authorities for hate speech and/or terrorism.

Gaza has been referred to as a prison for over a decade, Israel controls how many calories are sent into Gaza only allowing the bare minimum for the people it has Gaza Health Ministry census information for. Chemical weapons such as white phosphorus has been used and in the last invasion of Gaza depleted uranium rounds were used. Organs are harvested from illegally detained prisoners with some prisoners being disappeared and their bodies never released. As a colonial project they‚Äôre ethnically cleansing the populace but doing so at a slow rate for the appearance of being civilized.

But yeah, thinking on it there is a factor preventing them from being on the Nazi‚Äôs level, Israel Is still considering PR and as such can‚Äôt commit the atrocities in full. From what ‚ÄúBreaking the Silence‚Äù, a group of IDF/former IDF members say they‚Äôve instead found new ways of terrorising Palestinians that aren‚Äôt recognised as traditional barbaric forms of torture but are designed to target psychology to leave less physical evidence. So, I think I agree with you in that there‚Äôs a difference in severity and scale, intent though, I think if they could they‚Äôd go full Nazi

No, I know you‚Äôre not defending Israel. Though I‚Äôd note that much of this has been the norm in Israels treatment in the past. In the past both the US and UK had leaders who saw themselves as Israels superiors and thus were challenging and constraining them more rigorously.

israelexposed,comment,kyjchzd,Usual_Camp_6918,,I wish I had a better place to post this . The zionists agenda in the US has been very successful. So successful that we're helping genocide in Palestine. It's completely disgusting anyone on this planet is defending the zionists Israelis in their destruction of the people of palestine and the infrastructure. There is not one thing anyone can say to me that would justify the actions taken by the entity of zionists Israel and it's backers here in the USA. It's theft it's murder and full of lies and deciet to help them in their quest to get Palestinian property. The politicians filling their pockets of dirty zionists dollars and refusing to even say a word about the disgusting actions. The defending of Israels life as if the Hamas is going to or able to destroy Israel. The only reason Israel would be destroyed is because of Israels actions against Arabic peoples and if they weren't pimped out by the us govt Israel would be gone by now but it's not happening. The US zionists and Israeli zionists have fattenrd the pockets of too many sellouts to have Israel be threatened.  The only thing the zionists don't have any it is what pisses them off the most is fearless courage. If they were courageous they would not be stealing land and commiting genocide. If they were courageous they wouldn't be killing starving people waiting for food. They wouldn't be destroying hospitals. They wouldn't be bombing unarmed non combatants. They wouldn't be killing foreign aid workers trying to help the Palestinians. And they would be fighting Hamas head on. But they are not. They resorted to killing women and children by bullet bomb and starvation. Oct 7 has almost nothing to do with Israels excuses for their current actions. I'm sure it was planned and played out perfectly when the idiots defending Israel use the excuse of the attacks to full out assault the Palestinian people and the infrastructure.  The uncourageous zionists military is a representation of the uncourageous Israeli zionists. If there were any courage among the entity this wouldn't be happening. If they didn't have the unhinged thought that they are gods chosen ones this wouldn't be happening. From the top down it's just a criminal organization claiming to be a civil democratic nation. The level of lies and disruption from the truths are many. And since they are the ones controlling the main media outlets and also killing Palestinian journalists who are targeted. They control the narrative. It's uncourageous lies and actions that make these criminals the nastiest entity that has no right to exist anymore. They have killed and destroyed and lied and self victimized so much they should be dissolved or at least take the teeth away. They can't do it on their own so they gotta steal it . And good luck if you think that there will be a safe place for your criminal settlers to rest their heads. They have created along with the zionists govt. And military. A nightmare. They have created the worst kind of enemy by bombing from a distance shooting starving people killing women children and unarmed non combatants whole families killed in the tens of thousands. Did they think they could really make it happen. . It's just an abortion of the power they have been given and they fucked up. They have never deserved America's protection but they got it not only protection we're helping them kill. The Israeli lobby is just another group who are not for America. They for Israel and they drag us into the ugliest actions since nazi Germany . If you want to call it antisemitism. If the sensitive blame gamers wast to say I'm anti Jewish then so be it. It's just another excuse. It's just another uncourageous action to get the tables turned away from criminal action . The pathetic claims have nothing to do with being antisemitic. The weak assholes claiming such are trying to hide their anti humankind destroying genocidal cancerous liars. They crossed the line long ago and have not changed their disgusting ways. They lie to everyone including themselves. It's just a matter of time until they disappear. Here in the good ol usa we need to get together not let these unhinged maniacs control us. The Israeli lobby and the politicians who defend them should be ran out of Washington. They are no good for this country. It's not that I'm an anti Semite I'm an anti genocide I'm pro America as a united country without the zionists nut jobs dragging us into their shithole.  Say what you will . If your uncourageous you will say shit that is just an excuse to turn the eyes off israel.zionism. the chosen ones are an embarrassment to civilization. And a dangerous unscrupulous  immoral entity claiming to have God on their side . Thank you religion. End this madness. And learn about real courage from the Palestinian resistance and from the countries standing up to this travesty being allowed to happen . Fuck Zionism and fuck anyone who kills who defends who backs up who lies for or fails to find out the truth. The terrorism begins and ends with Israel and it's disgusting actions fuck them all,2024-04-07T22:43:24+00:00

This is not the country I want to represent the voice of the people which the current govt cares nothing about except when there are upcoming elections.

Does palestianians deserve to be free?

ChatGPT
The question of Palestinian freedom is complex and involves various perspectives. People hold diverse opinions on the matter based on historical, political, and cultural factors. It is essential to consider the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and work towards a just and lasting solution that respects the rights and aspirations of all involved parties.

Does Israeli deserve to be free?

ChatGPT
The right to freedom is a fundamental human right that applies to all individuals, including Israelis. It's important to recognize the aspirations for security and self-determination of both Israelis and Palestinians. Achieving a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict involves addressing the legitimate concerns and rights of all parties involved.



User
So why not the palestinians?

ChatGPT
The question of Palestinian freedom is closely tied to the complex and longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Different perspectives exist on how to address the issues, including the rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians. Achieving a resolution that ensures the freedom and rights of all parties is challenging but crucial for lasting peace in the region. The international community often advocates for a two-state solution that recognizes the rights of both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security.



User
Why one group is treated as human and not the other on the subject above?

ChatGPT
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a deeply rooted and complex issue with historical, political, and cultural dimensions. Views on the matter vary, and different parties may perceive the situation differently. Human rights and equal treatment for all individuals are fundamental principles, and efforts should be made to address the concerns and rights of both Israelis and Palestinians. It is essential to promote dialogue, understanding, and respect for human rights to work towards a just and equitable resolution to the conflict. International efforts often aim for a solution that upholds the rights and dignity of all involved parties.



User
Yes but you said isreali have the right for freedom but not palestinians, they are also human?

ChatGPT
I apologize if my responses gave that impression; it wasn't my intention. Both Israelis and Palestinians are human beings with equal rights, including the right to freedom, security, and self-determination. The goal should be to find a just and lasting solution that respects the rights and aspirations of both groups, fostering peace and coexistence in the region. The international community often supports a two-state solution as a means to achieve this, recognizing the rights and dignity of both Israelis and Palestinians.

israelexposed,comment,kyjvxlg,lightiggy,,"One should mention that despite recognizing Israel, the United States de-facto supported the Arabs in the 1948 war. Under British pressure, we maintained an embargo in both sides. We also restricted the immigration of males of military age to Israel from the American occupation zones in Germany and Austria, which would've only weakened them. The government strongly discouraged Americans from traveling to Israel to fight for them, which is why ""only"" 750 American Mahal volunteers arrived. Had Roosevelt lived longer, we most likely would've supported the Arabs outright. Roosevelt supported a Jewish state in Palestine. However, he started to back away from Zionism when King Ibn Saud expressed adamant opposition. George Marshall was enraged when Truman recognized the newfound Israel to win Jewish American votes. Still, when nine Americans, under a scheme by [Al Schwimmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Schwimmer), who is described as the father of the Israeli Air Force, smuggled surplus bombers to Israel, they were charged with violating the Neutrality Act.

[Charles Winters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Winters) and [Hank Greenspun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Greenspun) pleaded guilty. [Elynor Rudnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elynor_Rudnick) pleaded no contest. Greenspun was fined $10,000, while Rudnick was fined $1,000. The judge spared Greenspun from a prison term, citing his ""noble motives"". [Sam Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Lewis_(pilot)) was acquitted after a lone juror insisted that he'd merely been a hired pilot following orders. Schwimmer, Ray Selk, and Leo Gardner were convicted at trial. Also convicted was the company used for the smuggling operation, Service Airways Incorporated. In 1950, U.S. District Judge Peirson Hall imposed $10,000 fines on all three men, and another $10,000 fine for Service Airways Incorporated. Schwimmer was also stripped of his veteran benefits and right to vote. Hall was sympathetic to the defendants, but said he couldn't let them off entirely.

>""I cannot bring myself to send these men to the penitentiary. But one who attempted to take into his own hands the conduct of international relations might well bring about disaster.""

In February 1949, Winters was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined $5,000. U.S. District Judge Alfred D. Barksdale, who was less sympathetic to the motive for the smuggling operation, rejected a request to have him released on probation. Barksdale described arms trafficking as ""too grave and too widespread"" to allow for probation. He also rejected a request from Winter's lawyer to have his guilty plea withdrawn. Ultimately, Winters was the only one to receive a prison sentence. All appeals in the smuggling case were rejected. The fines, totaling $46,000 (nearly $600,000 in 1950), would be paid at the expense of the Israeli government.",2024-04-08T00:50:12+00:00

israelexposed,comment,kykqc60,Dear_Occupant,,"If we're going to look past Netanyahu and get to the root of the problem, I say let's go all the way with it. There are two critically salient facts about this conflict, without which nothing useful is ever accomplished through talking, and I hear no one else insisting upon them.

1. The October 7th attack was a military operation carried out upon [soldiers, not civilians,](https://archive.is/Uu2PV) and thus legal and valid according to all the laws and informal rules of war. It was equivalent to the Tet Offensive, not 9/11 (and I made that exact point on the very day it occurred). Hamas are not villains, they are not terrorists, they are in fact the only people in the entire world sacrificing their own lives on a daily basis in order to defend the civilian population of Gaza, first from a totalitarian occupation, and now from genocide. If that's not heroic, then what is?

2. The Zionist project is inherently antisemitic on its face. Zionism posits that Jews are uniquely incapable of living among and alongside people of other nations, which is the very definition of antisemitism and has been the core contention of anti-Semites for thousands of years. The creation and maintenance of the artificial state of Israel is the single greatest threat to the safety of Jews worldwide, and it is only through the Diaspora that Jews have found and will continue to find lasting security, just like every other marginalized group of people existing everywhere else in the world. Israel is a colonial project akin to Liberia, and like Liberia, it is ultimately destined one way or another to be repatriated to its indigenous population, a fact which Netanyahu understands better than perhaps anyone else alive, and its prevention is the very reason he is carrying out a campaign of extermination. 

As long as we agree to the bullshit make-believe rules of the colonizers, talking accomplishes nothing. Zionists begin every discussion by insisting upon two things: that you condemn Hamas and that you acknowledge that Israel has ""a right to exist,"" as if any country enjoys such a fiction. This is meant to obscure the fact that **Palestinians have the right to defend themselves from the Zionists who are stealing their land**. Every discussion or debate about this issue must begin with that central fact and stay rooted upon it because it is the truth and it is absolutely unshakeable. Every other consideration is secondary and withers when set against it.",2024-04-08T04:34:20+00:00

israelexposed,comment,kye27jy,Nikonglass,,"When you look at Israel-Palestine relations over the last 70 years or so, Israel doesn‚Äôt have a clear moral high ground. Settlements and the killing of woman and children pre-Oct 7 is very unfortunate, as is much of what the Palestinians has done to Israeli homes and Israeli citizens. At the same time, Palestine can hardly claim its own moral high ground in any way.  Their leadership is even more responsible for isolating its civilians and radicalizing them against a people that at least at some points in that history wanted to move forward in a constructive way. Rejecting a two state solution not once, but twice, really looks bad for Palestine in hindsight. 
But that brings us to where we are today.  Attacking a right wing-led Israel, and then having soldiers hide within homes, schools, and hospitals, while targeting Israeli soldiers and civilians with your own weapons. Isn‚Äôt that tactic in itself what has led Israel to retaliate and kill the civilians that you care so much about?  At least also hold Hamas responsible in some way instead of pretending that they are just a group of lovable freedom fighters who are standing up for justice.",2024-04-06T22:59:09+00:00

israelexposed,comment,kyg0dvf,hotspicylurker,,"The conflict lasts since 1917 not since October seventh. But yeah easy, I hate HAMAS, they should not have killed 1200 people and fuck them for doing that. But also Israel should not have breached the Genocide convention after that and killed about 12.300 children (so far).

Also Israel should not have blocked all food/fuel/medicine from getting to Gaza, because that is a warcrime ""collective punishment"" Hamas has about 25k members (according to IDF) Israel has killed much more than 30k people so far. You can try your best to convince me in this comment thread that all of that is justified. But I am not the only one whose image of Israel changed for ever. I know for now not that much has changed in international politics for u guys, as many of your most important ally countries are being ruled by 1000 year old dinosaurs. But one day people my age and younger will be the people making politics.

What the IDF is doing right now is realy well documented for all to see. Shooting hostages, aid workers, people waving white flags, bombing hospitals, dressing up as nurses and doctors to kill enemy combatants in hospitals, singing ""burn their village"" while making tiktoks of their warcrimes. I dont know if youll believe me. But I realy am not antisemitic. I dont hate jews, I dont believe in any conspiracy theories bout them. I hate antisemitism,

Yet I feel Israel lost its legitimacy over the past few months. If you wan't to see how Israels image in the eyes of the world changed listen to Francesca Albanese. Please remember, she is neither Hamas nor a Hamas sympathiser.

The Gaza Strip, a densely populated coastal enclave, has been caught in a relentless cycle of conflict and destruction. The recent escalation has left the region reeling, with catastrophic consequences for its people. Let‚Äôs delve into the grim reality:

Infrastructure in Ruin

Medical Facilities: Over 80% of Gaza‚Äôs medical facilities have been damaged or destroyed. Hospitals, clinics, and health centers that once provided critical care are now reduced to rubble. The wounded and sick face immense challenges in accessing medical attention.

Roads and Transportation: A staggering 90% of Gaza‚Äôs roads lie in ruins. These arteries, once vital for movement, commerce, and emergency response, now resemble broken veins. The destruction impedes access to essential services, exacerbating the crisis.



Humanitarian Crisis

Displacement: More than 1.8 million people ‚Äî approximately 80% of Gaza‚Äôs population ‚Äî are displaced. Families have lost their homes, seeking refuge wherever they can find it. Schools, hospitals, and makeshift shelters are overcrowded, testing the limits of endurance.

Starvation Threat: The entire population of Gaza ‚Äî around 2.2 million people ‚Äî faces imminent threat of starvation. The destruction of infrastructure disrupts food supply chains, leaving families hungry and desperate.

Electricity Shortage: Since October 11, Northern Gaza has been plunged into darkness due to a lack of electricity. Basic services, including healthcare and sanitation, suffer as a result.",2024-04-05T12:36:28+00:00

If the CIA had personnel spying on American soil, it would be a scandal like you wouldn't believe. Like, global news level of scandal. If someone had evidence of CIA officers spying on united states soil both the FBI and CIA would be equally interested because it would mean something was very, very wrong. And if they were, because of those risks, it's doubtful they'd be driving around in an Escalade. 

Further, the longer that trope (the CIA spying in the USA) goes on, the more likely innocent people get harmed because if or when they misattribute who is spying or harassing them, the less likely they'll see any justice for those actions. It's not uncommon for people to unknowingly blame the actions of the FBI, DHS, and DOD on the CIA but unfortunately when that happens, it only harms ordinary citizens.",2024-04-04T21:33:49+00:00

There are tens of thousands of people around the world whose job is primarily to find US government employees, and especially wait for them to fuck up. It's practically a sport for other countries to tie up different elements within the IC. For instance, if the FBI reasonably believed that the CIA was spying on US soil then it affords opportunities for countries hostile to the United States to see how much the FBI is willing to overlook as a way to potentially corrupt the government because as long as the FBI thinks the CIA is doing it, then it basically gives adversaries a blank check to do whatever they want.

His buddies would be like ‚Äúhey we should such and such‚Äù and next thing you know he‚Äôd be saying that shit on TV. He was a willing puppet. As such there isn‚Äôt much to either like or hate about _him_. I was more frustrated that we were basically watching a PR dude who would make seemingly random decisions that obviously weren‚Äôt his own because he didn‚Äôt have the mental capacity to make them himself. And to top it all off he lied point blank about the response to 9/11 - told everyone we‚Äôre going after the assholes who attacked us but then sent everyone to Iraq. Total joke of a human being.


Trump was a sleazy fuck but actually marched to the beat of his own drum, not the Zionists‚Äô. At least he used to. That‚Äôs why did everything to destroy him publicly (because let‚Äôs face it, there are a million charges to bring up against Biden and his cabinet right now, including treason, but no one is doing it). He was too rich to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù so this was their next move. I think he designed his rhetoric to appeal to the lowest common denominator but uses it as cover. So while I certainly think he‚Äôs a sleezy fuck he was the first dude to win the game despite the Zionists and his big mistake is that he didn‚Äôt take them on in Washington directly. I don‚Äôt think he knew that they‚Äôd come for him the way they did, nor did he know _why_ America has being going down the shitter. He blamed the Muslims when the real traitors were sitting in Washington. He had many of the right goals but went about them in all of the wrong ways, basically flailing around because he didn‚Äôt really have the whole picture and didn‚Äôt prepare properly for what he was going to (predictably) face.

Think about it, you could quickly delegitimize Hamas's claims that they don't operate in civilian infrastructure and/or use people as human shields. It'd be a win/win as the world condemns Hamas for such heinous actions.

You'd think that with the amount of ordnance that they're dropping, their claims that every target is documented & justified, and being under the microscope of the international community, we'd have footage rivaling in quantity to what the Ukrainians are putting out.

israelexposed,comment,kxyj1q3,goodbetterbestbested,,"I'm almost tempted to think this is some advanced psyop. It's so hyper-focused on language, like liberals tend to be, as being of utmost importance. Language is important, but it's not the most important thing to hyper-focus on. Whoever made this, at the very least, has a massive liberal hangover. ""How we talk about things"" is only important insofar as it helps us achieve actual real-world goals.

This list of ""red flags"" is ready-made to cause division among opponents of the genocide currently being committed in Gaza by Israel--with no credible strategy behind it to increase pressure on Israel, except perhaps scolding people on the Internet (not a credible strategy). It sounds like it was drafted by a bunch of Discord radicals who only talk to each other and whose ""activism"" involves banning people for using the wrong words. It sounds like it would *decrease* pressure on Israel by dividing its opponents into camps squabbling about ""how to say it.""

1. Apartheid is a more common reference point for liberals. Most people who can be turned are liberals. Liberals outnumber radicals among English-speakers. We want liberals to turn against Israel. We should strategically use their reference points and language in order to turn them against Israel. This isn't about our personal virtue and vocabulary as radicals. We can't just be talking to other radicals and shaming them/anyone else when they use the wrong words. The reason South Africa's activity against the genocide of Palestinians is so powerful is that there are similarities between South African apartheid and the oppression of Palestine. This ""red flag"" asks us to give up that powerful rhetorical tool. Is it a ""red flag"" that South Africa made these comparisons, too, when it went before the ICJ?

2. If you go straight to ""dismantling the Jewish state"" with liberals they will stop listening. We need more people on our side. Not less. Even liberals. They hold the power right now, even though they shouldn't, even though we are opposed to liberalism in general--the immediate concern is turning people against this genocide by Israel. That means we need to talk to liberals in a strategic way. I'm sorry to say it, but more-radical-than-thou posturing like this isn't helping anything. It might be useful as guidelines in a radical discussion group--not useful as a political strategy. And not least of all: Israel's claim to represent all Jewish people is a damnable, dangerous, anti-Semitic lie. Why would we want to repeat it as radicals? Doesn't it make more sense to appeal to diaspora Jewish people and weaken what Israel perceives to be its strongest pillar of support?

3. Calling a state/government a ""regime"" is an old trick of Western governments to delegitimize geopolitical opponents. It works. Let's use it when it works for us. This one, also, asks us to give up a good rhetorical tool.

4. Obviously someone opposed to two states, much less one secular state with Palestinians having equal rights and a right of return, is not a supporter of Palestinians. Not as much a ""red flag"" as a red Iron Dome fireworks display.

5. Calling it the ""Israeli-Palestinian conflict"" is less than ideal but it's also in such common usage that dismissing someone based on this ""red flag"" is ridiculous.

6. Referring to Israel and Palestine is a red flag?? How are we supposed to talk about this with people who aren't totally immersed in the righteous radical struggle? We need to talk to them, too. Not just each other.

7. Referring to beliefs is a red flag?? Sure, if they follow it up with enough ""buts"" that it denudes the entire concept. That's not always going to be the case. This one really smells like a psyop, because ""to believe"" is an extremely common English verb.

8. International institutions being increasingly on Palestine's side is a good thing. That doesn't mean they are the only arbiters of morality and rights. It means they can move the needle of global public opinion like few other institutions can.

slide 2: disagree on 3 levels.

a) I'd say all those terrible things will happen if an apartheid leadership is given a free hand.

b) Most people aren't going to grasp the whole settler colonialism. Hell, I even agree Israel is that but it is an obscure point that will easily get bogged down. You could also get bogged down in a discussion about any country in the Americas.

c) I can sell apartheid easily to anyone. I can't with settler colonialism. Let's message apartheid for that reason alone.

slide 3: This feels like purity testing at best. At worse, it feels like we are playing into Zionist hands by saying we want to destroy Israel. I'd rather get Palestinian right of return in full and have every legal right a Jewish citizen has without exception.

slide 4: This is purity testing. If the concessions our side has to make is let the single state be called Israel with the current flag, that's one I would strongly urged to accept so long as large concessions are given in return. In a perfect world, neither of those would happen, but this isn't a perfect world.

This is so vague, what international law is there regarding how private companies draw their maps, and how are they violating it?

>Google Maps is adopting the Israeli narrative of space, which is illegal according to international law. This includes recognizing several illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian West Bank as well as annexed East Jerusalem as Israel‚Äôs capital. 

Idk what ‚ÄúIsraeli narrative of space‚Äù means. Are you simply referring to the land Israel has more recently annexed, potentially in violation of international law? 

Google claims to simply be showing the 1949 Armistice Agreement line, and at a glance, it seems to be pretty closely matching that. After looking for several minutes, I couldn‚Äôt find any post 1949 armistice territory it claimed is Israeli territory, besides a small section of East Jerusalem. Could you perhaps share names or coordinates? 

But even if it does show Israeli settlements as Israel, how does that mean google is violating international law to show what Israel controls? Do you honestly think all de facto maps are, or should be, illegal?

>Furthermore, several communities marginalized by the occupation and under constant threat of demolition and forced displacement, such as Khan al-Ahmar, can only find their homes on Google Maps when zooming in to a very high degree.

This is weird. There‚Äôs multi places with that name so It‚Äôs possible I just missed the correct one, but all the ones I could find had just a few dozen houses. That‚Äôs just how google (or any other major mapping program) works, that small villages don‚Äôt typically show in the zoomed out map. You need to zoom in to see them.

israelexposed,comment,kxwa39p,DrKangaroo91,,"Thanks for your patience! Edited for details. Ok here's my reply : 


It's reported that the way international maps are drawn is by the creator of the map consulting respective governments to define their boundaries. This would implicitly mean that the UN country of Palestine was intentionally drawn over and left out. 

[Article 7](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%207,any%20incitement%20to%20such%20discrimination.)

‚Äú[Google‚Äôs] methodology for affixing borders and naming key features is completely unregulated and deviates from traditional mapping doctrine,‚Äù writes Ethan Merel in the¬†Columbia Journal of Transnational Law. ‚ÄúGoogle customizes its maps to adhere to each individual country‚Äôs beliefs and laws, so that its maps do not show a single and objective reality, but rather affirm existing perspectives of the world.‚Äù

The Israeli narrative of space is displayed on the map above. Myself, and apparently over 2million others, see no Palestine. Even a search of the word ""Palestine"" over the area doesn't show a clear border, or label as it does on most of (if not all of) the other UN countries. 

In terms of the coordinates, that's beyond me. Hopefully another redditor could figure that out. Al-Jahzeera has many stories over the years of illegal  Iraeli settlements established and maintained through various means. 

If wherever you are located, is no longer seeing Palestine on the map, I think that is important. I am in the United States, so it makes sense to me, because the US government is racist and has marginalized Islam for (at least) decades . 

In terms of that last part about blank spaces over villages, yeah, I also don't think there's anything necessarily illegal about that, either. Seems to happen all over the place if you scan around.",2024-04-03T19:00:32+00:00

israelexposed,comment,kxvhf2v,SiliconRain,,"I've been out demonstrating every weekend since October. There are jewish speakers at almost every rally and lots of jewish people in the crowd holding up signs that declare themselves as anti-zionist jews every single time. And I've been proud to stand and march beside them.

I remember the first big demonstration in October. There was a large group of orthodox jewish people with their clothes, hats, hairstyles and beards that clearly identify them as orthodox jews, and they all had signs in support of Palestine. There was a continual stream of people going up to them to shake their hands, wave, chat to them, take selfies with them.

The idea that people opposed to the zionist occupation have anything against jews is a deliberate fabrication by the zionists. Why do they put the star of david on their flags, planes, tanks and bombs? They want the whole world to think they represent all jews and judaism itself, but nothing could be further from the truth.",2024-04-03T16:28:09+00:00

israelexposed,comment,kxzqn24,Low_Banana_1979,,"Rwanda was a civil conflict, organized militaries participated only marginally. The only two military forces to have reached that current IDF level of depravity in history before (dancing over the corpses of the populations they invading, using dead babies as target practice, purposelly torturing and killing family pets in front of children to terrorize them, so on, so forth) where the JAPANESE IMPERIAL ARMY against the Chinese in the 1930s AND the US ARMY against Native Americans in their century long genocide against Native American populations.

The closest the German Nazis got to that level of inhumanity was AGAINST THE SOVIET RUSSIAN POPULATION during Operation Barbarossa. The shoah/holocaust, while being a real massive crime against humanity, was more of process of murder millions in an industrial scale with a methodology. So, there was torture for sure and inhumane extermination but not to that level OF DEPRAVITY the US ARMY or the JAPANESE IMPERIAL ARMY achieved against Native Americans and the Chinese, respectivelly.

That level of intensity, lower or higher, does not justify any of those crimes, but we have to stress that only the US ARMY and the JAPANESE IMPERIAL ARMY can be compared to the level of cruelty and inhumanity the IDF has reached in Gaza now to establish a pattern of comparison.

Germany must be held accountable for all the crimes its Imperial and Nazi regimes committed. It shall be forced to pay reparations to Namibia for the Herero and Nama genocides, to the FAMILIES of Jewish people that were mass murdered during the shoah/holocaust, and to Belarus and Russia for the crimes against humanity committed during Barbarossa.

The same with Japan that shall be forced to pay reparations to China, South Korea, North Korea, the Philippines, and Indonesia for the atrocities and genocides committed during the ocupation of those countries.

The same with the United States that also should be forced to pay reparations to countries like Haiti, The Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, Panama, Guatemala, Vietnam, Laos, North Korea, Cambodja (the US list of war crimes and attrocities is way too long and with too many countries/populations as targets), and to its own Native American and African American populations, both victims of deliberate and structured genocidal government policies and campaigns.

Problem is, as there was never accountability for crimes against humanity committed by the United States (and Japan too, never prosecuted due to being a US ally), we have this huge gap in international law that allow genociders to think they can walk free. We need to restructure international Law agencies and venues such as the ICC  to give them full independence and the ability to enforce real penalties against the states that sponsored or committed crimes against humanity when, after the due process of law, they are found to be guilty. And that shall include the United States, Germany, Israel, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, and any other country the international courts consider to be guilty, without ANY EXCEPTIONS.",2024-04-04T10:29:41+00:00

Yes, there were fatalities. That happes when you drop heavy pallets in parachutes. But, as everything in a war zone, it's calculated risks. They have flown something like 250 missions with three C-130s to date. That is a shitload of very much needed supplies, which has saved many, many lives. As grim as it may sound, in the end, it comes down to numbers. Save X, lose Y. If X>Y, do it.

As for military cooperation, I agree that it was spineless, but I can also understand their reasoning. They don't want to get Polanded, getting crushed between two stronger powers using their country as a battlegound.

Also, don't forget history. It was the Jordanian king who, personaly, flew one of the helicopters who got Arafat out from his house arrest, basically being a human shield to prevent the Israelis from shooting down the helis.
