Tax,post,1cri747,ineffable_journey,Any advice on responding to a Letter 4883?,"My mom is 87 and a few months ago her health quick deteriorated. One of the things I had to scramble to do was file her taxes. My taxes are pretty complicated and hers are pretty simple so I just fired up TurboTax and, using her previous year's return, filed for her. I have General Durable Power of Attorney, she was aware I was doing it, and helped me find relevant docs, etc.

Today, she got a letter 4883C in the mail. After verifying this isn't a scam, I called the number to verify her identity and her return. I was told because I hadn't filed a Form 2848 (Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative) I could not verify either of these over the phone. Further, because I had started the verification process over the phone but failed to complete it, her return was being flagged and I would need to file the Form 2848 and then \*make an appointment to do the verification in person at a local IRS office\*.

Can anyone answer these questions for me?

1. Is there any other way to verify this beyond going into an office? I probably don't need to tell you how sub-optimal this is for me on top of dealing with the other aspects of my out-of-state mom being in a care facility on top of my own...stuff.
2. The IRS accepted her (small) electronic payment for the taxes due. What are the real consequences of not following up to close this out?",2024-05-14T03:09:04+00:00
Tax,post,1crhsot,UncleShayShay,Co-owners of home with disproportionate ownership stakes & mortgage responsibility. ,"Hi, 

I am about to purchase a new home with my soon to be fiancé. We will own the home as joint tenants in common, with me having 85% and them having 15% ownership. The mortgage will be in both of our names and we will similarly split the mortgage payment 85/15. I’m unsure about laws in other states, but in Tennessee this form of disproportionate split ownership is common & legal. 

My question relates to how we should best set up the payments for tax deduction purposes. If I pay 85% of the mortgage from an account in my name only and they pay 15% of the mortgage from an account in their name only, it is my understanding that I will be able to claim 85% of interest and property taxes while they will be able to claim 15% of interest and property taxes. Under this scenario, I will be able to itemize on my taxes, but they will not. 

If I were to instead pay 100% of the mortgage from an account in my name only and have them reimburse me via A) monthly transfers over Venmo or PayPal or B) by paying for 100% of groceries, utilities, etc., would I then be eligible to deduct 100% of the mortgage interest and property taxes? Would I be able to under A but not B or under B but not A? Under A, there is a clear paper trail of them paying for 15% of the mortgage, but the payments would still be made from an account in my name only. If I am able to claim 100%, it nets me quite a bit more from a tax savings perspective (I’m in a very high marginal tax bracket) while her tax liability is exactly the same as she would be claiming the standard deduction either way. 

I have searched countless forms and articles online and find conflicting answers everywhere. Has anyone else had a similar situation and if so, how did you file your taxes? 

Thanks! ",2024-05-14T02:48:12+00:00
Tax,comment,l3ybc26,__chrd__,,"Regardless of money is transferred around or whose account pays the monthly mortgage payment, if the split is 85/15 then that’s what it is. This is the answer.

But…

My question is why? Who is skeptical of who in this scenario?

If it’s just you make more money, then also why? 

At 85% just buy it yourself then.

Or if you want them to have equity in it and they don’t have income to match evenly… still be 50/50 owners and cover the extra from your income like 85/15 would be anyway? 

Lmao, I know our individual incomes of course, but I couldn’t tell you who the fuck owns what asset and neither would my wife. Mid 30s, very different careers and incomes, 50/50. 

I know separate finances are a thing but unless you’re mega wealthy and they’re not, it just eventually gets easier to mingle everything together and not care about ownership stakes. 

You get majority of the house and they get the coat closet and part of the unfinished basement, lmao got it.

 I filed my taxes for 2022 before the deadline, was owed a refund. Didn’t pay a single second of attention to it until I needed my W-2 nearly 6 months later. Went back to TurboTax to see that my taxes were never actually filed because I got the EIN wrong. Fixed that, but turned out that I never submitted a new 1095-a form. After that, it was well past the deadline and I looked on the irs website to see there is no penalty for failure to file, so naturally as an idiot, I procrastinated and never filed at all. The longer I waited the more stressed out over it I became.

Fast forward to now, where I am past the new deadline for 2023 filings and I still haven’t filed for last year or this year. All because of the stress of not knowing how to handle the 1095-a situation, especially now that I’ve switched health insurance 2 more times since the 2022 filings. I don’t know what to do.

Tax,post,1crgd8w,JustSayNoNoYesYesYes,IRS Auditing my client to give her MORE REFUND.,"Strangest Form 4549 Tax Examination Changes I have ever seen.

2021 Client Filed Sch C with six figures business profit (legit business).  She also claimed the 10 COVID sick days credit which was based on amount of business profits (Form 7202 remember those?).

The Form 4549 audit denied her COVID sick days credit by REJECTING HER SCH C BUSINESS PROFITS claiming she didn't ""really"" have a business.

Since six figures worth of Sch C profit pays a good amount of Income Tax and Self-employment Tax... by denying her Covid Credits IRS is offering her FIVE figures worth of REFUND.

I mean I assumed Congress wasn't dumb enough to sign a COVID bill where people can make up fake business profits that entitled taxpayers more non-refundable credits than the actual taxes they pay (unlike the refundable Earned Income Credit because low income family with children make up majority of voters).

Is the IRS this dumb or are they throwing my client a curveball?  If client takes the IRS's position, ""Sure, delete my Sch C and give me that higher refund"" will IRS end up charging her with a felony for overstating her income just because she wanted to paid MORE taxes on the original tax return?

Tax,comment,l3y1ph6,ABeajolais,,"Hopefully your bosses don't have a clue about taxes and are just doing it wrong. Unfortunately it's likely they know it's not the right classification and are just trying to save money on payroll taxes, unemployment compensation insurance, workers compensation insurance, and all the other many expenses that employees bring with them. Unless you're in the business of being an office manager, like have business cards and do this for regular customers, you are nowhere near an independent contractor.

Being an employee vs. independent contractor is a matter of circumstances, not a choice. One way I would help clients determine how they should be classified is ask them what they tell people who ask what they do or a living. If they don't say something along the lines of ""I am a business owner, here's a business card,"" they're usually an employee. If they said ""I'm an office manager"" I would immediately say ""You're an employee.""

Now you have a choice. Sometimes people go along with the misclassification, pay the additional self-employment tax (an extra 15% in addition to income tax), go without unemployment coverage and insurance, in order to keep their jobs. There are forms you can file to be treated correctly when you file your return, but the IRS and state will go back to your employer if it is determined you are an employee and they'll owe a bunch of money. So you kind of have to go along with it or not.

I don't know if I've ever seen an actual business owner that didn't have a clue about employees vs. independent contractors. Based on experience I'll bet your employers are perfectly aware of the misclassification that's why they're doing it. They might pretend they don't know anything about taxes but then why would they classify at all? The bottom line is it doesn't matter if they're doing it on purpose or not. It's wrong on many levels. People tend to get away with this for a couple years, then some employee will blow the whistle, and it becomes a multi-year expensive mess.",2024-05-14T02:20:25+00:00

Your customers do not need or want to know about your personal income tax.

 However yesterday he said ""son i may have the 1099 in my files"" when in fact its my own llc and really if (the customer who had the 20+yr relationship with him was sending my dad a 1099 under his name this sparked a red flag because im the one paying taxes.  

Sorry for the scooby doo type mindset but im meeting with my brother to discuss with my dad these issues but i dont mind not getting a 1099 as long as the lady is not seding him one for my revenue in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022.

My dad is very secretive so I'm always skeptical.  I did sit in some of the tax attorney meetings with my mom and dad but to me it just showed me that i needed to set up my books correctly and pay my dad as an employee before retiring in the next few months.



Except in 2024 he's out of retirment and has the customer paying him in a new business name.

In the beginning I advised clients to determine reasonable compensation based on my interpretation of the tax code and advised them to take a significant amount in wages especially for a single-owner corporation. The maddening reality was the IRS and courts did not follow those principles, and in reality tended to accept what I considered to be unrealistically low valuation of income that was from services. Few of these cases went to court, other than an occasional clear cutting operation by the IRS to send a message, then the IRS would go back to weak enforcement.

Tax,post,1crfxsw,syfyb__ch,Federal W4 adjustment entry to reduce withholding given known calculation,"Single. Paid bi-monthly salary. 2024 tax year.

I've calculated:

1. Total projected fed income tax liability for year (no FICA/state) = X
2. Total expected fed withholding for year = Y

Y - X = $2557.68, so overpayment expected and big refund

Clearly the IRS withholding calculator prompts you to enter the appropriate strange numbers into W4 Step 3 (dependents and other credits) and Step 4 (other income, deductions, extra withholding), i've heard some folks get prompted to increase their other income and enter deductions, some are prompted to enter dependents (when they have none), etc.

Anyway, I'm shocked there is no instructions on simple numbers to enter to minimize any refund...perhaps because Uncle Sam likes interest free loans and it is a ""cool if you do but we're not gonna hold your hand to do so because it reduces our loans"".

Here is what I am thinking of doing, let me know if incorrect: 4b 'deductions' is calculated from a worksheet in which you enter a number that is subtracted by the personal exemption $14600.

So if I put $2557.68 into line 4b, would this adjust the paycheck withholdings appropriately for the tax year? I'm assuming this line is for the tax year and not per paycheck...although given that 4c extra withholding is *per pay period* maybe this is not true?

Appreciate any tax accountant advice especially since stuff like Intuit Quickbooks is so ubiquitous and everyone just uses it to punch in numbers.",2024-05-14T01:13:52+00:00

If you need to withhold 2557 less over the remaining 32 weeks of the year, put 4155 in section 3. That reduces withholding by 79.90 a week.",2024-05-14T01:30:05+00:00

Tax,comment,l3yby1p,BayBear71,,"Comparatively lower general/social government spending coupled with:

* Relatively high sales
   * Groceries are exempt
* Excise taxes on most services - sales tax in practice on subscriptions and services provided by businesses
* Gas tax - highest in nation (not counting California's special environmental taxes)
* Liquor taxes - highest in nation
* Property tax
* REET tax - Paid when selling home (1.1%-3% of sale price)
* Estate tax - applies to estates over $2.1MM, but most wealthy estates maneuver around this tax
* Capital Gains tax - over $250k in gains in any year. May be voted out in the future.
* B&O taxes - aka business revenue taxes
   * Big source of revenue for the state.
   * B&O taxes are applied to business revenue and are the highest in the nation on average. B&O taxes are not seen directly by most residents, but do result in higher costs for goods and services.

Is Washington's tax structure good or bad? For most taxpayers it's very net positive. Let's compare to Oregon:

Washington Resident (Single Renter - 30% of income available for purchases w/ 8.5% sales tax):

* $50k income tax ($0); sales tax ($1,275)
* $100k income tax ($0); sales tax ($2,550)
* $250k income tax ($0); sales tax ($6,375)

Oregon Resident (Single Renter - no deductions beyond standard)

* $50k income tax ($3,500); sales tax ($0)
* $100k income tax ($7,500); sales tax ($0)
* $250k income tax ($22,000); sales tax ($0)

Washington residents would have to spend roughly $40k, $75k and $250k each year, respectively per income bracket, to break even with Oregon's income tax. Wildly unrealistic for most taxpayers at 80%, 75% and 100% of gross income respectively. Oregon has higher property taxes on average.

Tax,post,1crf1ak,Icy_Register_9067,How long does using the Sprintax software take? Waiting for my updated 1099 & leaving for a trip soon :/,"In a bit of a tricky situation. I’m Canadian & currently not living in the U.S. I resigned from a U.S. role in early 2023 and promptly emptied my 401k and paid federal taxes on it at the time of removal. That means I only have about 6 weeks of 2023 US income and a very small amount in 401k (that again I already paid federal taxes on). 

Well I’m now trying to file my U.S. taxes & I have until June 15 to mail in my tax return. But I’m leaving for a trip this Thursday and won’t be back until May 29th. I was going to file through the Sprintax software but Guideline, the company that was supposed to give me my 1099 form, messed up AGAIN and did not update my 1099 to reflect that federal tax was withheld when I emptied my 401k. 

I sent them an angry email after finding out the updated form was never uploaded and will call them tomorrow as well. Hoping to have the new 1099 by EOD tomorrow. 

But that barely leaves me any time to actually file my taxes through Sprintax! How long does the actual process of filing your taxes through their software take? 

I was hoping to mail my return to the IRS via tracked postage *before* I leave for my trip, so now I’m worried.

The sale will be to the extent of parent’s basis in the property, with a gift of the balance. I obviously can’t say whether that actually makes sense to do, but I would have no problem doing it if it makes sense. Assuming a pro-rata partnership, it’s an indirect gift of 1/3 of the balance to each child. The only thing I have a little pause about is whether the gift would qualify for the annual exclusion. That may not matter to parent, but if a partner can’t immediately require a distribution from the partnership, I’d want to look into that more before.",2024-05-14T01:01:12+00:00

What is sounds like you are trying to say is that the parent will contribute real estate to a multi member LLC and wants to avoid the built in gain allocation if the property is sold.  However, all of the steps you mentioned are backwards.

First she can give one third of the property to each of her children, and file the gift tax returns reporting the gift against her lifetime gift tax exemption.  Then, all three of them can contribute their interests in the property to an LLC, if they wish.

I've been able to get correct formulas for CASDI-E, FITW, MED, and SS, but I have not been able to figure out CA's state tax system. My initial idea was this:

*Values*

Pay Period = 26 weeks

Standard Deduction = $5,363

1st Level Tax Rate = 1%

1st Tax Level Max = $10,412

2nd Level Tax Rate = 2%

2nd Tax Level Max = $24,684

3rd Level Tax Rate = 4%

*Cells*

L38 = Take Home Total (Pre-Tax)

B11 = Standard Deduction / Pay Period = $206.27

D11 = $206.27 + 1st Tax Level Max / Pay Period = $606.73

C8 = 1st Level Tax Rate = 1%

G11 = $606.73 + (2nd Tax Level Max - 1st Tax Level Max) / Pay Period = $1,155.65

E8 = 2nd Level Tax Rate = 2%

H11 = (1st Tax Level Max / Pay Period) \* 1st Level Tax Rate = $4.00

G8 = 3rd Level Tax Rate = 4%

J11 = $4.00 + \[(2nd Tax Level Max - 1st Tax Level Max) / Pay Period\] \* 2nd Level Tax Rate = $14.98

*Function*

=if(L38<B11,0,if(and(L38>B11,L38<D11),(L38-B11)\*C8,if(and(L38>D11,L38<G11),(L38-D11)\*E8+H11,if(L38>G11,(L38-G11)\*G8+J11,""ERROR""))))

Can anyone see where I'm going wrong? It's always a few dollars off from the actual amount. Here are sample values of what the answers should be:

Take Home Total (Pre-Tax) ->CA State Tax Amount

$123.63 -> $0.00

$795.55 -> $8.56

$1,575.24 -> $34.94

Tax,post,1crdfiw,Fantastic_Cherry_827,Sales & Use Tax - Does it Apply Within the Same State? - Oklahoma,"I understand that sales and use tax applies when items are purchased out-of-state and used in another state. But what about when items are taxed in the same state, but different counties tax differently at the county level? 

I learned that OK is removing the state portion of tax on groceries (4.5%), but the remaining city/county tax could still apply, depending on the county. I'm still not sure how to know what those county rates are, but assuming they all come up with their own county rates...

Ex: Where I live in County A has grocery tax at 3.0% but County B has grocery tax at 0%. If I live in County A, and buy groceries in County B, bringing those groceries back to County A (for use), is this a case where use tax would apply?

  
Sorry for the granular-level question, but I only understand use tax at the state-to-state level. How does this work county to county? Or is this not a thing?

I am trying to file my taxes for 2020 because I believe I can still get my refund. As an international student receiving scholarship/grants, I always filed my taxes as a non-resident alien and got a federal refund for that.   
  
The problem is I became a resident for tax purposes in November 2021. Since I am filing late, should I file as my current status (resident for tax purposes) or the status that I was back in 2020? I tried to do as my current status through Turbo Tax's desktop package, but it's telling me I owe money for the first time.

Even more, the return lists MY bank not my parent's bank, and an LLC thing that was my parent's and not mine that is NOT part of inheritance. So is the board somehow confusing BOTH of us? 

Finally, the document gives a solid month (until June 12th) to file the return or why it is not there. Customer service gave me nobody, the website did NOT help, and the earliest appointment is JUNE 4TH, which gives us a month of stress and a week to solve whatever it is.

Dealership said I can claim the $7500 when I file my 2024 tax credit (I checked the income eligibility and my wife and I qualify; we also have high tax liabilities and typically owe or nearly break even the last few years).  I didn't think much of it but the dealership said they could not provide me with the $7500 at the time of sale because the dealership said that the IRS hasn't approved their dealership yet.  

  
I find out about a week ago that in order for me to qualify, I needed Form 13400 from the dealership so I can submit the paperwork correctly and that the sale of the vehicle had to be reported within 3 days of sale.  That obviously didn't happen because they aren't registered.  Dealership is adamant that the bill of sale is all I need.  I emailed the IRS asking for clarification on what to do in this situation, but I know regardless, I need Form 13400 and that the dealership is wrong.  

  
My question is:  am I out of luck on the $7500?  Even if the dealership is still waiting to be approved, how would that work for any future EV purchases from this particular dealership?  Are they just out of luck and anyone who buys from them is out of luck?  Is there any recourse for someone in my situation?

>Q2: How can a buyer confirm that they will be able to claim a tax credit for a new or previously owned clean vehicle? (added Oct. 6, 2023) 

>A2. For vehicles placed in service Jan. 1, 2024, or after, sellers will submit seller reports electronically to the IRS. The IRS’s acceptance of this seller report means a qualified manufacturer has submitted the VIN listed in the seller report to the IRS as an eligible vehicle. For previously owned clean vehicles, sellers will also provide the sale price (which must be $25,000 or less) and review vehicle history reports in making attestations regarding the vehicle’s eligibility. **Eligible buyers can rely on a seller report that a seller has submitted electronically to the IRS, that the IRS has accepted, and that the seller has provided to the buyer, as confirmation that the vehicle is eligible.** The buyer must still meet eligibility requirements, which are described in elsewhere in these FAQs, to claim the credit or to transfer the credit to a dealer.

My guess is that the dealer owes back taxes to the IRS and therefore can't register with the IRS Energy Credits Online Portal. See [IRS Rev. Proc. 2023-33, page 16.](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-23-33.pdf#page=16)

The dealer is wrong. 

See if you can get the dealer to submit the report as soon as possible. The 3-day deadline is just an IRS policy that the IRS can ignore, but the requirement for the dealer to send a report to the IRS is a law that the IRS cannot ignore.  Maybe if the report gets to the IRS before you file your taxes, there's a chance the IRS will let the 3-day deadline slide.",2024-05-13T22:45:13+00:00

To be eligible to claim the AOTC or the lifetime learning credit (LLC), the law requires a taxpayer (or a dependent) to have received Form 1098-T, Tuition Statement, from an eligible educational institution, whether domestic or foreign. Generally, students receive a [Form 1098-T](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-dft/f1098t--dft.pdf)PDF Tuition Statement, from their school by January 31. This statement helps you figure your credit. The form will have an amount in box 1 to show the amounts received during the year. But this amount may not be the amount you can claim. See qualified education expenses in [Publication 970](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p970.pdf)PDF, Tax Benefits for Education, for more information on what amount to claim.

  
And: 

Make sure you are qualified before claiming the credit and make sure you keep copies of all the documents you used to find out if you qualify and determine the amount of your credit. If the IRS audits your return and finds your AOTC claim is incorrect and you don’t have the documents to show you qualified, you must pay back the amount of the AOTC you received in error with interest. The IRS may also charge you an accuracy or a fraud penalty or you can be banned from claiming the AOTC for two to ten years.",2024-05-13T22:04:13+00:00

Tax,comment,l3ycpp8,the_undertow,,"This is a correspondence audit the lowest level, and less stressful on people, because it is handled by correspondence via USPS. This isn't anything to worry about. 

Think about it in this context - so much of what we do and file is self-reporting. Imagine how a business files taxes: you don't submit a damn receipt, right?

  
The ""get yourself a CPA"" bullshit is why I feel like if that's gonna be our answer, the response should be, ""Get the CPAs off fucking Reddit,"" if this is the boilerplate reaction.

  
The IRS is spot-checking your return and only asking about one item. They will just want to show that the 1098-T (the tuition form the college issues) matches with your input. They will likely want proof of the kid's existence, and the tuition paid, and whether or not scholarships exceed the tuition needed for the credit. If the return was done correctly, no change. If the AOC credit is denied, the credit is denied - however - that doesn't mean the Lifetime Learning Credit wouldn't apply.

Don't stress it. As a tax prof, a CPA, and former field agent - I can assure you, a CPA or attorney, or Enrolled Agent, has no more authority with the IRS than you do.

If you feel the results of the line-item audit are not acceptable, then consider hiring someone who knows the tax code a bit better.",2024-05-14T03:42:46+00:00

Tax,post,1cr88e4,ohio_asian,(USA) Taxation - trust income versus personal income,"This is strictly a hypothetical question as part of my ""what if I won the lottery"" dreams.  I am not sure if my reasoning is correct.

Assume I created a trust and invested in stocks / mutual fund, and there are long-term capital gains (LTCG).

I see for trusts, the 20% bracket for LTCG starts at \~$15,000 (rounded for easier discussion).  For personal income (MFJ), the 20% bracket starts at $554,000.

I understand a trust does not pay taxes on its distributions, or on contributions.  

I think, then, you would want the trust to distribute any LTCG at least up to the $554,000 to you each year.  If you don't spend all of it, then you would contribute it back into the trust.  This way, you would pay a lower LTCG tax rate on the difference of (554k-15k=) $539k.  

Does that sound correct to you?

Tax,comment,l3we4nh,micha8st,,"I don't know about california law.  I've also never been divorced.  My understanding is that retirement is considered as part of the settlement process, and that ***something*** would be done to equalize retirement funds.  If you have your own retirement accounts that would be taken into account, but I don't know if you'd get W+H / 2 into your QDRO-modified retirement account.  Really, my understanding of divorce is that dollar-equality is just a baseline, and if you value keeping the house more than your ex does,  that gives the Ex some leverage in negotiating how to split other assets.

Where it might help is your W-2 or 1099 income allows you to put more into a retirement plan than just an IRA.  As a spouse, you don't need income to contribute to an IRA -- that can be done on the basis of your family's joint income...  if you file a joint income tax return.  But you can put over 3x into a 401k, if you qualify.  How that gets structured could be any number of ways, for example, you could start a bookkeeping consulting buisness, and open your own Solo 401k or whatever and then contribute to the 401k on the basis of income that business takes in.  Operating that business has the added benefit (in my mind) that you can work for not just your Hubbys business.

Are you really concerned about a divorce, or are you only what-ifing here?   Frankly, my experience watching people in my age-range divorce suggests that there's typically not a lot of assets to worry about after the fact.    I'm a child of divorce myself, but that came after years of grad school -- the divorce effectively slowed the the parents ability to dig themselves out of the grad-school hole they dug themselves.

My wife and I are racing to get her 2020 taxes filed in order to qualify for the stimulus payments from COVID.

My understanding is that her return is due by Friday.

I am a Canadian CPA, so no tax slouch. My wife had no income in 2020. I am trying to figure out a software/online platform that can be used to paper file her return. 

I was trying freetaxusa since it had good reviews, but since I dont have an SSN I can't get her return done using that, even if i pick married filing separately.

Any advice would be most appreciated!

Tax,post,1cr70ax,Background_Grab_8506,Question about switching to Mark-to-Market after substanical short term losses in prior years,"I previously requested the IRS to allow me to go mark-to-market for 2021. My request was late but I asked them to make an exception since I was only aware of this option after speaking to a CPA. The IRS has ignored my request.

So, I put in a new request to elect mark-to-market for 2024. The IRS will get back to me in 60 days.

Question here is, have I potentially screwed myself? If the IRS accepts me as mark-to-market in 2024, and I make 100k at the end of the year in short term stock gains, however, I still have over $200,000 in short term stock losses from 2022 and 2023, will I be taxed on the 100k short term stock gain? Or will my $200k short term losses from 2022-2023 carry over and cover my tax liabilities on the 100k gain?

Tax,comment,l3w41b9,ABeajolais,,"You will ask yourself why you waited so long to get help from an EA or other tax advisor. They will be able to take your information, process it, give you forms to sign, then you wait for your refunds. It's not uncommon for people to get panic reactions to the IRS, where if anything happens it's like a downward spiral. Having a good tax preparer completely takes that pressure off you. I've seen a lot of people whose lives changed for the better when they got professional assistance with their tax returns.

If the majority of your income is from W2s, and you have not received any bills from the IRS, that usually means they owe you money. They'll send out a notice in a heartbeat if they think you owe them money, but they will not contact you if they think you'll get a refund you when you file a return. All penalties are based on an amount owed. The most important thing is having paid your taxes, which is done through your withholding. In other words, if you've paid in enough, but didn't file, you haven't done anything wrong in the eyes of the IRS so you're not in trouble. Your only problem is you overpaid and you're leaving all that money on the table.

The statute of limitations filing for a refund is three years from the original due date of the return. Unfortunately the 2020 due date was April 15, 2021, so 22, 23, 24 is already past the due date.

Call at least five places and get an idea of how the people are to work with. Many preparers require payment up front for past-due returns because lets face it, people who let their taxes slide often let other things slide like paying their tax professionals. CPAs are overkill for something like W2, would be expensive. EAs are good and usually not overpriced. Even unenrolled preparers can be good. Usually the best tax offices are local places that have been around a while. I recommend staying away from the big box tax prep firms in strip malls. They're always huge prices, and the quality is wildly inconsistent. You don't know it you'll get someone with 25 years experience or someone doing their first tax return.

Pop over to freetaxusa and with your tax documents in hand you can get at it. If you just have a w2 it will be pretty simple. When it asks you about prior year stuff, read the question closely. Many will pertain to carry over losses, etc. You’ll have none of those. You may need the prior year AGI to file electronically, and I’ve heard people here say enter 0. If that doesn’t work, print the return, sign it, and get thee to the post office. The package will tell you where to send it. 

You’ll tackle it. Also look into VITA programs in your area. The one I volunteer at I think only starts prior returns in May so that may not work.

Any insights would be highly appreciated

I suspect you may have fallen victim to the extremely misleading propaganda that California has high taxes.  For average incomes, California in fact has one of the **lowest** effective income tax rates in the entire country.  Only for extremely wealthy (high-income) people does California's tax rate shoot up, and it does have the highest top-marginal rate in the country, starting on income over $1 million (Single).

By contrast, Oregon has the highest income taxes in the US on nearly all people.  In part that's because Oregon has no sales tax and relatively low property taxes.  They need to raise revenue somehow, and most of it comes from income taxes.",2024-05-13T18:55:31+00:00

* OR has higher property taxes - because must get revenues somehow for police, fire, schools, etc

I like Cali's tax law but that deficit is spooky, and not exactly attracting new business with how easy it can be for business owners to get into that last bracket. Imo they need to stretch it further and have that max bracket be a higher dollar amount to enter.

Tax,comment,l3wdm71,penguinise,,"Before you read on, what do you think the effective percentage rate is on a married couple in California earning $80,000?

There are nine states without an income tax on most personal income (some have added excise taxes on some types of income, such as Washington).

Rates are just public information that is easy to look up, but here is an [analysis I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/keakzs/comment/gg1yjrb/) of a married couple with no children earning the median California income a few years ago.  For effective income tax rank, California was 37th out of the 41 states with an income tax, with a 2.31% rate (and number 38, Ohio, will subject you to significant local income taxes in almost all cases).

It's a simplistic analysis based on simple rates: I know for California it ignores both SDI and the personal exemption, but it's close enough.

Because such a couple is just brushing the 6% marginal bracket (which goes up to 9% in the low $100s) and almost **no one** understands what a marginal tax rate actually means, general perception about California's income tax rates are wildly skewed.",2024-05-13T19:59:24+00:00

Tax,comment,l3wzmet,braxford,,"So there's a few""incentives"" you as the buyer can try to request with/through your realtor. We originally made an offer on a home that was NEW construction, but had been sitting on the market for a bit. They started at 750K, then came all the way down to ~600,000. I know, wild. But they were desperate to sell. We offered 590,000 with a 2-1 buydown, which meant at that time the seller (developer of the new build) would eat the cost of paying enough money to bring our first year's mortgage rate down 2% from whatever market was at the time. So, if it was a 7.5% interest rate, our first year would be 5.5%. Then, year two would be 6.5%. The seller AGREED to that. So, if we went through with that sale and the offer they accepted of 590,000 would men subtracting the cost of 2% less than market rate that first year, something like what, several thousand dollars? Meaning they would net 590,000 minus the costs associated with reducing the interest rate. This was in September of 2023 when it was a buyer's market.    
    
With our house that closed, it was a similar situation. We offered 590,00 w/ 15k to cover ""closing costs"" or expenses. So the seller accepted 590,000 minus 15,000. We used that 15,000 to cover closing costs, and to pay enough money ro reduce our first year's mortgage a percent, or roughly 320 a month (x 12 months.)",2024-05-13T22:08:42+00:00

Irs views my business as a sole proprietorship. I have a stripe account set up to process payments on that by credit card. Income is about 1200 a month on the rental space. Stripe just emailed me about setting up a regular tax withholding for this. And that got me a little worried.  I know I can’t deduct the whole mortgage, but a reasonable  portion of it is allowable, and combined with depreciation and other expenses there isn’t a lot left of reportable income at the end of the year, about $2000. 

The question is do I need to set up an estimated monthly/quarterly withholding to avoid penalty? Or is it reasonable to just square up annually with the irs when I file my return? ",2024-05-13T18:00:00+00:00
Tax,comment,l3vwtf1,RasputinsAssassins,,"You can just have a little bit extra come out of your W2 job to cover it. So, if the tax on the side income caused an increase of $1200 in your tax bill, you could just have the W2 job hold out an extra ($1200 divided by the number of times you get paid).

To clarify, none of the mortgage payment is deductible, except the interest portion. And then only that portion that constitutes your business use percentage. And then only if you qualify for the Business use of Home deduction. You calculate the business use percentage by dividing the square footage of the home (not the lot) used EXCLUSIVELY and REGULARLY for business by the total square footage of the home (not the lot) to determine the business use percentage. So, a 2000 sq ft home in which you use 200 sq ft EXCLUSIVELY and REGULARLY gives you a 10% business use factor. That 10% is applied to the applicable home expenses, which are typically utilities, insurance, property taxes, mortgage interest (but not mortgage payments/principal), and depreciation.  Depreciation is limited to the structures; you have to back out the cost of the land from your home's basis for depreciation because land can't be depreciated.

Tax,post,1cr4job,SweetLilFrapp,Concerned about tax fraud,"Hey there everyone. Coming to this subreddit because I’m young and dumb and need tax advice but don’t have anyone close to get it from. 

So I’m a self employed house cleaner. I don’t have an LLC because it’s just me and I’m able to pay all my bills doing what I do. I chose to go fully self employed because it was the only thing that would work with my school schedule and unique circumstances. Anyway, I made somewhere towards upper $30K last year and it was one of my first years being fully self employed. I get paid through Zelle, Venmo, and then of course with cash. I count ALL income I get and don’t hide anything. I also save all my receipts and keep them all in folders. 

So for 2023 I went through this tax guy who has his own business and told him I was nervous about my tax bill. I knew I was going to face penalties for not paying quarterly like I was supposed to but in my case scenario I just figured it’d be easier to just tackle one big bill in payments. When he punched all my numbers into his system, my bill was supposed to be around $4.5K. But then somehow I guess he “lowered my income” by moving some of it into business expenses. I forget how much it was off the top of my head but it was something like $8K he put as my business expenses. It lowered my annual income down to like $15K, which made my tax bill like $2100. He explained all this and I told him that it seemed almost illegal. I mean my rent for the entire year alone was $12,000, so just by doing basic math NOT INCLUDING my other personal bills, you could tell I made more than $15K for 2023. He said nothing would come of it because my income was so low even before the write offs and credits and stuff and that the IRS wouldn’t care. 

I filed, and am now making payments on my bill. But should I go back and amend it? What do I do? ",2024-05-13T17:08:34+00:00

So here's the whole situation: My wife and I both work full-time and file our taxes jointly. Last year I received a graduate teaching assistantship with a stipend of $14,400 dollars that was supposed to last from august-May, but had to quit in February when a scheduling conflict came up with my full-time employer.  I've since worked the issue out, and am being offered the assistantship with the same stipend for the 2024-2025 school year. I also picked up a very short position as a grader for final's week as a another graduate teaching assistant had a medical emergency and needed someone to grade her classes final papers. For this position I will be paid $20/hour for up to 20 hours of grading time, of which I plan to charge the full 20 hours.

I'm pretty sure I didn't do this correctly when I filled it out for the initial assistantship last year, since I didn't seem like any taxes got taken out of my earnings from the assistantship, so my question now is what all needs to be calculated into extra withholding on my W-4 that I'm filling out as I recomplete the onboarding process at the university I attend?

I rolled over 2 out of state 529 funds into my current state for my child. Whoops, you're only allowed 1 rollover a year. Curious what steps I can take to avoid penalty on the indirect rollover which hasn't been deposited yet.

For this leftover indirect rollover, the state closed the account but I can open another one and redeposit it back into it. Will that count as a rollover itself though with no proof of it being refunded back into the account due to any education refund? Do I just deposit it into current state fund and eat the penalty (not large sum)? Any recourse here for my mistake?

Tax,post,1cr1tek,hoccmich,Car Lease Trade-In and Capital Gains Tax,"I think it has been established if you buy a car and it has appreciated in value, when the car is sold or traded-in for a net profit, capital gains tax is owed. Now whether people actually report the car transaction on the tax return is a different question.

I think it has also been established if you lease a car, buy-out the car, and in-turn sell the car for a net profit (where sale > buyout), capital gains tax is also owed. Again whether people report this sale on their return, may vary. 

So what happens when you trade-in a lease (car A) that has positive equity, as part of a deal to buy a different car (car B)? In other words, the dealer is willing to pay more than the buyout amount of the lease. Thus you have a net profit, that is subtracted from the cost of car B. 

I could see one reasoning capital gains tax is owed on the net profit from the lease trade-in (where dealer buyout > lease buyout). Since technically the lease trade-in is a different transaction than the purchase of car B. 

On the other hand, the customer (lessee) never owned the lease car A (i.e. did not hold title). The bank (lessor) owned the lease. Thus how could the lessee make a sale and profit from a car they never owned? Also overall, there was not a profit; actually a ""loss"" from the purchase of car B.

Additionally the basis tracking of car B starts to get ambiguous. I assume the basis of car B is not the actual total that they paid, but rather the amount before the net trade-in was deducted?",2024-05-13T15:16:13+00:00

>I think it has also been established if you lease a car, buy-out the car, and in-turn sell the car for a net profit (where sale > buyout), capital gains tax is also owed. Again whether people report this sale on their return, may vary.

No, this would not be correct. You are not really 'buying' the car for the buyout price. You're just enforcing the part of the contract that lets you pay off the portion of the car that you didn't pay for in the lease. You've paid full price for the car, by that point - it's just that you've done it in pieces. Selling it for anything less than full price (which is how it virtually always goes) would not be a gain.

>So what happens when you trade-in a lease (car A) that has positive equity, as part of a deal to buy a different car (car B)? In other words, the dealer is willing to pay more than the buyout amount of the lease. Thus you have a net profit, that is subtracted from the cost of car B.

Tax,comment,l3v96tq,6gunsammy,,"You can easily make a profit on a lease buyout.  It happens for apartments in New York (and other places) and it has been happening for cars.

Bottom line is that if someone gives you cash or equivalent for terminating a lease that is taxable income.

In the case of an auto lease buyout it generally follows that you buy the car for the contract price, and then the dealer will give you additional money towards a new car or lease.  The additional money is taxable.

This is very common when businesses trade in vehicles as they are often fully depreciation.  Prior to the TCJA cars could be 1031 exchanged and gain deferred, but TCJA ended 1031 exchanges for personal property.  This makes any gain on trade in, lease or otherwise, taxable and makes the basis in the new car the purchase price.",2024-05-13T16:09:02+00:00

Would the gain on the lease trade-in be considered short-term or long-term? The lease trade-in occurs instantly so it seems like it would be short-term.

Regarding basis of the new car as the purchase price, shouldn’t it be the purchase price plus the trade-in gain? I’m thinking in a hypothetical situation where the new car is sold for an amount greater than purchase price/trade-in gain, one would have to pay capital gains tax twice on the trade-in gain amount (if basis is only purchase price).

Tax,comment,l3vapi9,wild_b_cat,,"You're probably right but I'd like to understand. The [language](https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/usc26/1234A) of 1234A doesn't seem to map cleanly to a lease buyout, which seems to resemble a conditional sales agreement more. There's usually no speculation involved - many people lease cars fully intending to buy them for their residual at the end of their contract, and the buyout conditions are set well in advance. It doesn't seem to map cleanly to something like an apartment lease buyout.

I can't find a clear ruling one way or the other online though.

Edit: Consider the comparison to a call option on a stock. If exercised, your cost basis includes the premium paid to buy the option.

Obviously a car lease is very different since you actually get to own the car. But for many people the intent of a lease is to hopefully take advantage of the difference between your payments and the residual value. If you wind up 'overpaying' (more in lease payments than in actual depreciation) you can get the difference back through a buyout. If you wind up underpaying you can hand the car back and walk away. There's a significant speculative element to it, enough that it seems reasonable to me to treat this as a sales contract, and thus to include (a portion) of lease payments in cost basis.

I'm definitely open to being proven wrong.",2024-05-13T16:17:49+00:00

Your employers should be able to get you copies of your W-2s. If you didn't file for 2022 you might want to get your 2022 W-2s and file for that year also.

Penalties for late filing are 5% of the amount of tax owed per month. If you wouldn't have owed anything (including if you'd be due a refund) the penalty is zero because 5% of $0.00 is still $0.00.  The penalty for late payment is only 0.5% so even if you owe and can't pay better to file ASAP to slow the bleeding. And if you're owed a refund better to file ASAP to get your money.

If you can be claimed as a dependent, there's a box to check on your own tax return to indicate this. If your mom can claim you, check that box whether or not she actually does claim you.

Tax,post,1cqy49q,Annabelle74911,Does selling ISO stocks exercised in the same year help reduce AMT vs selling those exercised years prior?,"AMT question

Suppose I exercised 10k shares of stocks at strike price of $5 in 2023 when the stock was worth $50. Let’s say I exercised another 10k in 2024, same strike price and stock price.

If I want to sell 10k shares of stocks this year in 2024, which lot should I sell? My accountant says selling the 2024 lot will help me avoid a ton of AMT as they were exercised and sold the same year. 

I want to make sure this is correct, so your advice would be greatly appreciated.",2024-05-13T12:30:36+00:00
Tax,comment,l3v8y7n,penguinise,,"It depends, but the older lot is probably better to sell.  In short, the AMT is a parallel tax system where you use different rules to count your income, and you pay whichever tax is higher.

Most people in this scenario will in the long-run pay only regular tax and no excess AMT, recouping the excess AMT paid via the AMT credit in the future.  If that applies to you, you generally want to minimize your regular tax even if you pay more AMT up front.

By exercising your 2024 tranche of options, you produce $450,000 of ordinary income for the AMT (and nothing for the regular tax).  If you paid excess AMT in 2023, that excess is probably creditable, and can reduce your 2023 regular tax to your 2023 tax under the AMT (the excess will carry forward).

**No matter what else you do with the stock, your income (and hence tax) for the AMT is fixed**.

If you sell the 2023 shares in a qualifying disposition using your numbers, you produce $450,000 of long-term capital gain for the regular tax (and zero additional income for the AMT).  This will likely result in less tax under regular tax, so technically you would ""pay a ton of AMT"" but this is mostly a red herring.

If you sell the 2024 shares in a disqualifying disposition, you produce $450,000 of ordinary income for the regular tax.  This would likely stop you from paying excess AMT, but only because you increased your regular tax to be even higher than your tax under the AMT.  This extra tax is not creditable, and so it is generally worse to pay.

\~

This analysis generally holds for the numbers you provided and a reasonable amount of background income like \~$150k of salary.  To the degree your numbers differ, the stock price has changed, etc. it could impact the analysis.  I would recommend finding a tax professional who makes you feel comfortable analyzing the exact numbers in the scenarios above, or learning how to do it yourself.",2024-05-13T16:07:38+00:00

Wow, I can’t believe someone with so much hubris yet gets it wrong. A non resident cannot have an S Corp or have an LLC taxed as an S Corp lol. If I’m going to be just like you, then I’ll be saying “that tells me you don’t know about how LLCs are structured” 


>What you are not understanding is that you have a US legal entity, and the phrase that it's ""disregarded for tax purposes' is accurate when talking about a US citizen, The entity does not pay the tax but the US citizen owner would have to. That is what ""disregarded for tax purposes"" means.

Tax,post,1cqwhpz,placebo_me_please,Understanding the mechanics of the Foreign Tax Credit (Form 1116),"I've manually worked through a simple tax scenario using the 1116 form in which my only source of income is from the UK. I'm at a loss because, despite paying the equivalent of nearly $12K in UK taxes for the 2024 tax year, I would still owe the IRS $1.3K in taxes after applying the FTC in my 1040.

Based on my understanding of the form after reading the IRS instructions, I can see why this is happening: on Line 19 of Form 1116 I am asked to compute the ratio between my gross total income minus UK taxes AND the US standard deduction (numerator) and my gross total income minus just the US standard deduction (denominator). The result is less than 1, so my FTC is less than the tax I owe the IRS (i.e. the value I populated on Line 16 of 1040), and thus why I owe would $1.3K. 

Now for my question: How can I have paid so much in UK taxes and still owe the IRS? Furthermore, if the ratio I'm calculating is correct, then it seems that if my UK tax liability were to increase the ratio would depart further from 1, thus reducing my FTC and resulting in more taxes owed to the IRS. In other words, in my circumstance the only way for the ratio to ever equal 1 is if I pay zero UK taxes. What am I missing here? Why does the FTC behave in the opposite way I expect it to?",2024-05-13T11:00:30+00:00
Tax,comment,l3ujmn8,vynm2,,"How much US-source income did you have? 

You can only take a FTC to offset the US tax owed on your foreign income. The standard deduction is allocated between your foreign- and US-sourced income on a pro-rated basis. When this is done, the standard deduction allocated to your US-source income is typically less than your US-sourced income, so you'll end up owing some US tax on your US-source income. All of US-tax owed on your foreign-sourced income would be offset from your FTC. Any additional UK tax credit you have can be carried forward for up to 10-yrs to offset future tax on any foreign-source income. 

The kicker is that as long as you live in a country whose income tax rates are higher than in the US, that credit carryover is likely just going to grow. It will be helpful/usable if you end up living in a country with lower tax rates than the US.",2024-05-13T13:33:31+00:00

Tax,comment,l3t3l2c,MyFriendTheAlchemist,,"Here is the applicable info from the IRS(at least I believe so):

“If a sale is canceled before the taxpayer places the vehicle in service (that is, before the taxpayer takes possession of the vehicle), the vehicle will still be eligible for a Clean Vehicle Credit upon a subsequent qualifying sale to another taxpayer. In that case, the credit would not yet have been transferred.

In the case of return made within 30 days of placing the vehicle in service, the purchaser cannot claim a Clean Vehicle Credit with respect to the vehicle. Such vehicle, once returned, was already placed in service by a taxpayer and a new Clean Vehicle Tax Credit is not available to a subsequent buyer.

In the case of a return of a previously owned clean vehicle, the vehicle, once returned, is not eligible for a credit upon a subsequent sale if the vehicle history reflects that such subsequent sale is not a qualified sale. However, if the vehicle history does not reflect the prior sale and return, the vehicle remains eligible.

If the taxpayer made an election to transfer the Clean Vehicle Credit, that vehicle transfer election is nullified, and any advance payment made pursuant to the clean vehicle transfer rules will be recaptured from the eligible entity as an excessive payment.”",2024-05-13T04:30:25+00:00

>(ii) Vehicle return. If a taxpayer returns a previously-owned clean vehicle to the dealer within 30 days of placing such vehicle in service, then—

>(A) The taxpayer cannot claim the section 25E credit with respect to the vehicle;

>(B) The sale will be treated as having occurred (and a transfer of the vehicle is therefore considered to have occurred by reason of the sale), and the vehicle will not qualify for the section 25E credit upon a subsequent sale;

>(C) The seller report must be updated by the seller; and

>(D) A credit transfer election made pursuant to section 25E(f) and § 1.25E– 3, if applicable, will be treated as nullified and any advance payment made pursuant to section 25E(f) and § 1.25E–3, if applicable, will be collected from the eligible entity as an excessive payment pursuant to § 1.25E– 3(g)(2).

>refund is not a measure of complexity

The refund you'll get is what you paid minus what you owed. What you owe is not necessarily as much as what you'll declare you owe: depending on your situation there may be deductions you don't know you can take, or special provisions that apply to you, or some other expenses you can deduct but which might take too much effort for you to calculate and track.

So, without good tax knowledge, you might end up paying more than you really have to, and a good tax preparer could get you to pay less taxes in an absolutely legal and appropriate way.

Based on what you said in other answers, they took a look at your earnings, so it may be clear to them that they'll likely get a return.

>if the preparer gets more money for more refund they have an incentive to fudge the numbers and who gets left holding the bag when it comes up for audit? You do

100% with you on this. I'd say they have an incentive regardless: if you get a refund, you're more likely to stay with them. So they have an incentive to fudge the numbers either way.

Tax,comment,l3uzd8r,SkankOfAmerica,,"Excellent!

Next step is to get your return prepared and filed elsewhere.

Then, work on getting your money back:

Contact the old/bad preparer again, let them know that you've done your taxes elsewhere, that you know, and know that they know, that contingency fees are prohibited per Circular 230, and that you'd like an immediate and full refund. Make the request in writing. Certified mail w/return receipt.

The fact that it was paid for with a credit card gives you a little bit of leverage, as you can reach out to the card issuer if attempts to resolve with the merchant fail. Don't actually mention this fact in your letter, they already know that credit card transactions can get reversed.

I doubt it will actually come to this. More likely once they get your certified letter they will refund you just to get you off their backs. If they don't, you've got proof that you attempted to resolve with the merchant.

Whether they refund you or not, you should complete Form 14157 (Return Preparer Complaint) and then either fax or mail it to the IRS: [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14157.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14157.pdf)

Your refund is almost certainly being held because you claimed over $20k in credits, which is extremely unusual and will therefore need to be manually reviewed by the IRS.

I’m withdrawing 50,000 and I understand I’ll be on hook for taxes and 10% penalty. My other question is, I see that they don’t hold the money back for taxes and such. Does this mean, I can just say use 30,000 that I need and hold the 20,000 in my bank account to pay the IRS as tax next year? 

Withdrawing 50k, expecting 40% in taxes and penalty. So my actual usable amount for purchase of the house will be 30k. The remaining 20k will be in my account until next year when I use it to pay the tax? 

Or, does it make more sense to withdraw only 30k and figure out the 20k for taxes and penalty next year during tax time? Is the bank/mortgage lender going to care that I’m on the hook for 20k next year? Do they want to see that penalty and tax in my account or are my retirement accounts fine?

Tax,comment,l3uwk5m,Velocityg4,,"What you should be seeing on your pay stub is deductions. Something like this.

* Gross Pay  $1,000
* FICA SS Tax  $62
* FICA Med Tax $14.50
* Federal Tax $85
* State Tax $19.50
* Net Pay (the amount you are paid) $819

If you aren't seeing that. You are self employed and have to pay the full taxes yourself. Which means double on FICA taxes. About the same on the others. So, you'd need to save to pay the taxes. Which would be about $257.50 with that weekly pay rate.

We also have a pay as you go system. Which means you need to make estimated tax payments. You should be paying parts of your estimated taxes on 4/15/24, 6/15/24, 9/15/24 and 1/15/25. For your 2024 taxes. Otherwise you may face penalties if you wait until 4/15/25 to pay everything in one lump sum. You make estimated payments with form 1040-v.

There's plenty of online calculators you can use to get a rough estimate of your yearly tax liability. Just be sure to calculate FICA (about 15%) and Federal Tax. As many will only list one or the other or only list the employee portion of FICA (about 7.5%). If you are off a little bit. It doesn't matter. As under payment penalties are based off the amount underpaid. If you haven't made the April payment. The sooner you pay it. The less penalties will accrue.

Keep all receipts related to work. Also keep a detailed mileage log. If using a vehicle you own vehicle for work. As an independent contractor. You can take deductions on expenses you incur related to work. Such as tool purchases, actual auto expenses or standard mileage, tax preparation, licenses, professional insurance, work phone, self employed health insurance and so forth. Which you wouldn't normally be allowed to deduct as a W-2 worker. As these are business expenses for your Schedule C.

Tax,post,1cqh68h,jschreck032512,I’m interested to know what some people here think about representation and taxation in the US. ,"I know there aren’t any laws, amendments, or any legal precedent that protects Americans against being taxed without being represented in our government, but this was one of the major issues back in the day that the country was founded on so it should still be something that is actively protected against in my own opinion. 

If you choose to read on and share your opinions I appreciate it, but in all seriousness and respect would the current state of the US government and its function be considered to not represent the vast majority of citizens and therefore the majority of citizens should not pay any federal taxes whatsoever? I do believe this to be the case and I think there’s enough evidence available to fight that in court. I’m interested to know the tax expert’s view on the topic.  

I understand that just having the right to vote is supposed to mean someone is represented, but in all reality it doesn’t in today’s world. According to the Pew Research Center the top concerns of American citizens aren’t having meaningful action being, but are being promised as huge changes going to be made. https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/02/29/americans-top-policy-priority-for-2024-strengthening-the-economy/

For me that would indicate that the vast majority of Americans aren’t represented as they are being allowed to vote, but voting isn’t achieving anything for them in terms of influence on the government’s actions and priorities. I know a lot of people have much more love for the government than I do, which isn’t a difficult achievement if I’m being honest, so it may take more convincing for some people. 

Here’s an article that says there is no competition in our elections due to the influence of money and fundraising on a campaign. That effectively defeats the purpose of the vote and means the representation of the victor is for the people who provided funds and not the voters. https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/competition-in-congressional-elections-money-versus-votes/F84C395D7155C9C0D82971BC0BFC75E8

Here’s another good one about how the money is what’s represented and not the people. This one is long, but it’s a good read. https://repository.law.uic.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2781&&context=lawreview&&sei-redir=1&referer=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252Fsearch%253Fq%253Dstudys%252Bprove%252Bmoney%252Bis%252Bmore%252Binfluential%252Bthan%252Bvoting%2526rlz%253D1CDGOYI_enUS733US734%2526oq%253Dstudys%252Bprove%252Bmoney%252Bis%252Bmore%252Binfluential%252Bthan%252Bvoting%2526gs_lcrp%253DEgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIJCAQQIRgKGKABMgkIBRAhGAoYoAHSAQkxMDU3OWowajmoAgCwAgHiAwQYASBf%2526hl%253Den-US%2526sourceid%253Dchrome-mobile%2526ie%253DUTF-8#search=%22studys%20prove%20money%20more%20influential%20than%20voting%22

Tax,comment,l3ripuk,penguinise,,"There's a lot going on here, but your post seems to boil down to the depressingly common opinion of this century that civic engagement is pointless because the system is somehow ""rigged"" to make your participation in democracy worthless.

Bluntly, that is simply nonsense and it is a very convenient excuse to avoid confronting the harsh reality that getting people to agree with you is *difficult*, and that you and your six friends who agree with you are but seven people in a country of over 300 million.  For example, the survey you linked identified Americans' top priority as ""strengthening the economy"" and you imply that the current Congress is not doing this.  But ""strengthening the economy"" is as meaningless a policy proposal as ""make everyone happy"".  Do we need to encourage free trade in order to lower the cost of goods, or adopt tariffs in order to raise the wages of domestic employees who produce goods?  Do we need to increase welfare subsidies for the poor, or do we need to lower taxes?  Does balancing the federal budget, or the national debt, even matter?  Should we increase fossil fuel production to lower the price of gas, or invest tax dollars into renewable energy production and alternative fuel vehicles?

*All* of these policies *could* be construed as ""strengthening the economy"", and I doubt you will find any majority agreement on a complete set of answers to those questions.

Even when a majority of people think something, it doesn't necessarily mean they prioritize that issue when voting, or choose to vote in their self-interest.  62% of Americans think that abortion should be legal in ""all or most cases"" and 57% of them disapproved of the decision in *Dobbs v Jackson* \[[1](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/07/06/majority-of-public-disapproves-of-supreme-courts-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/)\], yet enough of those people continuously voted for Republican candidates for the last 50 years who fairly openly prioritized stacking the Supreme Court to achieve just that outcome.  It's simply a cop-out to try to point to ""money in politics"" or a ""rigged two-party system"" on this issue - Republicans have consistently polled higher than the 43% of people who don't disapprove of *Dobbs* and I am happy to bet you that Donald Trump is on his way to receiving more than 43% of the popular vote this fall.  The simple truth is that while people may profess a view, they simply **don't vote that way.**

At the end of the day, your problem is with people.  You want a system that does what **you** think is right, and you don't want the hassle of having to make other people agree with you.  It's far easier to blame invisible, intangible boogeymen than to acknowledge the fact that democracy is simply a slow, unwieldy system which takes an immense amount of work to keep running.",2024-05-12T21:23:20+00:00

Tax,comment,l3vmtsk,jschreck032512,,"I don’t think that you quite get what I mean, or possibly understand how voting works in the US. Our government, not being a democracy, is not 100% dependent on votes from everyone for everything. Instead we vote for representatives to represent us based on the campaign they run showing what they believe in and how they’d vote on certain issues. Using this information we cast a vote saying “that’s how I want this person to vote so I am represented.” The problem at this point is shortly after said person is elected it becomes apparent that they have changed their voting patterns based on money received without giving the public another opportunity to say that’s how I want to be represented. 

An example is Senator Sinema from Arizona. After she already had a track record of voting against corporate tax breaks and in favor of increasing taxes on the top earning corporations she based her campaign for senator on this. She even criticized other candidates for supporting corporate tax breaks. She was elected and then suddenly changed her stance on this issue sometime after the 2020 election. Turns out she received over $2.5 million from corporate PACs that oppose increasing taxes and are pro tax cuts. She then began voting that way as well despite the fact that we didn’t tell her that’s how we wanted her to vote. We voted for her because she said she would do the opposite of what she ended up doing. This is only one example that a quick google search will provide you with plenty of references for. This now means that one of the primary issues she campaigned with was not true and could have been the difference between her winning the election and not winning the election if this was not part of her campaign. That means she doesn’t properly represent the voters. These voters that aren’t represented are still being taxed. 

Also, this issue is so bad that even China knows. Do you think they aren’t going to use that to erode our political systems? Here’s an article from China confirming that they recognize money is eroding democracy. It also includes many other things the PRC probably loves. https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/wjdt_665385/2649_665393/202303/t20230320_11044481.html",2024-05-13T17:27:31+00:00

I (thankfully) have savings to tide me over, but I'd like to continue maxing out my Roth IRA going forward. I currently do unpaid work for my parents (1-2 hours of per day, from IT to home repair) and my dad mentioned that he could just pay me $7k for that work going forward so that I'd have earned income to contribute to my Roth IRA. I'm worried that, in the event of an audit, the IRS would not consider that kosher as I wouldn't seek outside work apart from that $7k earned from my parents.

Am I right to be concerned? Thanks!",2024-05-12T20:06:09+00:00

Tax,comment,l3r3aa4,ABeajolais,,"It's ridiculous tax fraud and this person will pay the piper at some point.

There are strict rules the IRS has for recognition of a Qualified Charitable Organization. One of the rules is there is zero deduction available for any contribution that goes to the benefit of any particular individual. For example, if a church is a qualified charitable organization under the tax code and has been recognized as such by the IRS though filing financial statements, etc., in a 50-plus page application, and they solicit contributions for a community fund that's legitimate. If they're trying to help John Doe with an apartment and a car and solicit donations for that, those are not qualified charitable donations. They can help John Doe with funds from the community fund account, but not if the donations are earmarked for that person.

This is a classic example of someone with a tiny tad of tax knowledge thinking they're smarter than the IRS. It's a sham and a fraud, and it's just a matter of whether and when they'll get caught. The only question is whether they're committing tax fraud on purpose or they're stupid enough to think they're smarter than everybody else and they've found some stupid secret to not paying taxes.",2024-05-12T19:44:24+00:00

Tax,comment,l3rui6d,ReasonableAd5268,,"It appears you inherited $98,000 in 2019 and hired H&R Block to file the necessary forms, including the 706-GS, and pay the taxes owed. However, in 2024, the IRS notified you that the 706-GS form was not filed, and you now owe $34,000 plus penalties, despite having paid the taxes on time in 2020[4][5].

To resolve this issue, you should:

1. **Contact H&R Block** and request they amend your 2020 tax return to include the 706-GS form, even though the statute of limitations may have passed. Explain that they were hired to handle this specific form and their failure to do so has resulted in significant financial consequences for you[5].

2. **If H&R Block is unwilling or unable to amend the return**, you should file an amended 2020 tax return yourself, including the 706-GS form, and submit it to the IRS. Attach a letter explaining the situation and request the IRS waive any penalties and interest, as this was an honest mistake on your part and the taxes were paid on time[2].

3. **Request a transcript of your account** from the IRS to verify the $34,000 payment was received in 2020. This will help support your case that the taxes were paid, even if the 706-GS form was not filed[2].

4. **If the IRS is unwilling to waive penalties and interest**, you may need to negotiate a payment plan or settlement offer to resolve the outstanding balance[2].

It's crucial to act quickly to resolve this issue and avoid further penalties and interest. With proper documentation and a clear explanation of the circumstances, the IRS may be willing to work with you to find a resolution.

Here is what the IRS said when I told them I ensured to hire a professional, and ensured to have my payment delivered certified mail on time.  IRS Followup. Thank you for your follow-up. Your answer is mostly correct. You are permitted a deduction for the Generation Skipping Tax paid on the Form 1040, but the Statute of Limitations may have passed on amending the 2019 Form 1040.

 Here is an example of how it would work if the income you received was $10,000:

 **Generation-Skipping Tax, Form 706-GS(D)**

FMV of property distributed ..................................... $10,000

2019 maximum estate tax rate ...................................... 40%

Maximum GST tax .................................................. $ 4,000

 **Individual Income Tax, Form 1040**

Income per K-1 ....................................................... $10,000

Section 164 deduction for GST tax ........................... (4,000)

Net taxable income ................................................. $ 6,000

Assumed income tax rate ............................................. 25% (adjusted for example purposes)

Income tax .............................................................. $ 1,500

 

Total Tax Paid on $10,000 received: $4,000 (GST) and $1,500 (Income) = $5,500.

The Section 164 deduction would be part of your Form 1040, Schedule A deduction on your 2019 Form 1040. Again, it is likely that the statute of limitations has passed on amending the Form 1040, otherwise you would be permitted this deduction on The Form 1040.

Now HR block amended my 2019 return also last week for free but they did not do it right.  They removed all the k1 and pushed it to the  706-GS(d) but the example above shows I still need some on my k1.  Again I kept telling the lady this is not correct but she would not listen.  It really is frustrating that I am in this situation :(. This was the first return that I paid them to do.

However, you should have noticed rather quickly that your tax return hadn’t been filed.  For one, you should have been asked to review and sign (in person or electronically) your tax return so that it *could* be filed.  If that didn’t happen, your CPA didn’t have authorization to file, which you should have been aware of.

If that was a first-time mistake, you could have applied for — and probably obtained — a waiver of penalties and interest.  You’d still have to pay any tax owed, though.",2024-05-13T00:08:53+00:00

Tax,comment,l3v0r37,TaxCPAProblems,,"Long response since you asked:

706-GSD are used for the beneficiary to report and pay gst tax for distributions from a non-gst exempt trust.

The trustee files a 706gs(d-1) notifying the beneficiary (and the irs) of the taxable distribution (d-1, like k-1 but for gst reporting). Most likely scenario is that trusts were set up, gst exemption was not applied to the trusts on the gift tax return**, so the trust had an inclusion ratio of more than zero and distributions to skip persons causes indirect gst tax. Tax on taxable distributions reported on form gs(d) and payable by the beneficiary. Tax on taxable terminations are reported on form gs(t) and are payable by the tryst.

H&R block is absolutely not equipped to handle this. They can barely handle basic returns on a good say, as others have said. 

Honestly, most cpa's who don't work in trust/gift/estate would struggle with it if they even know anything about gst rules at all beyond the lifetime exemption. However the hard part is at the trust reporting level and figuring out when gst applies. if a client hands their non-big-box store CPA a gs(d-1) and says ""help"" they will at least do the research and be able fo handle from there. Gs(d) isn't a hard form... you're given a d-1 with all the info.

I'd go back to the trustee and confirm why OP received the form, confirm it isn't a mistake**, file and pay the required tax if it's legitimate, and assuming we are past the point of amending 2019 for the refund go after h&r block for the tax paid on their material mistake -- HOWEVER im taking what op is saying with a grain of salt. Did h&r block incorrectly pick up a distribution as income or did they correctly pick up income from a trust k1 and the 1040 is correct and just failed to correctly advise OP on the additional filing requirement [which may have been outside the scope for the 1040 they were emerged to prepare so legal recourse may be limited]. We would need more information and to see all support and the return before doing anything.

**Bonus conplexity for the trustee, which OP has little control over: Certain transfers made after Dec 31, 2000 could be subject to automatic gst allocation, and even if not properly taken on the original gift tax return could have still been allocated gst exemption and reduce the inclusion ratio to zero IF any exemption was available when the original gift occured, and gst exemption wasn't specially elected not to be applied. Howver, if this is a family that used up their exemption later it could cause a domino effect. Tl;dr: gift/estate rules can get extremely conplicated, especially when trusts are involved, and the grantors should make sure their beneficiaries have good advisors in their corner to avoid these kinds of issues.

Edit to add: if the 1040 income was truly overstated and you can't get it refunded because it's past the statute of limitations a cpa, ea, or tax attorney experienced in tax controversy/representation should be able to help you get the irs to transfer the incorrectly overpaid income tax to the correct tax type.",2024-05-13T15:19:40+00:00

With that being said, Ive been in good hands with a great CPA for over 10 years and he was a friend and responsive whenever I had questions.

Unfortunately, he unexpectedly died last year.  His brothers are all CPAs at their own firm, so they were going to take over all of his clients for this tax year.  That's the back story.

Right before tax season this year, I got an audit letter from the IRS about 2022.  They were asking about my mortgage interest deduction.  At this point, my new CPA already filed for 2023. This was in March. He said that he was too busy to deal with anything until after April 15, and to request an extension from the IRS, which I did.  They wanted some documentation about my mortgage and asked to fill out a worksheet.   

After the 15th, I finally got him to look at the IRS documents and we realized that my old CPA made an error in 2022.   I bought a new home (which he was aware of) and deducted all of the interest as he normally did, even though it was above the $750k limit.  I've had the same mortgage for over 10 years of dealing with him, and I think he just put in the new numbers without thinking about it.  A clear error.  

The new CPA just followed everything his brother did and filed the same way in 2023.  Which was wrong.  So he amended 2023 and refiled and I paid the difference.  

So we finally did the worksheet and sent the documents requested by the IRS, but in doing the worksheet he realized that his 2023 amended form was wrong again.  So he needs to amend again.  I'm just furious at this point.  It's another $1K difference but I paid a penalty for the first amended and now will have to pay another penalty for the new amended form. Total of $1100 in penalities.  For less than month late.

And now I'm just waiting for the IRS to respond, even though we know what the error is.  So that's the whole story.   Here are my questions:

Should I really be paying for these two penalties that were clearly errors by this new CPA?

Is there a way to just deal with 2022 with the IRS as we know what the error was?  Instead of waiting for weeks or months to figure it out?  Will I have to pay penalities and interest on this as well?

Tax,post,1cq9vaj,BlaBla123512,Roth IRA overpayment (I think),So I’ve been maxing out a Roth IRA for the past 15 years every single year.  Back in 2017 I got married.  My wife has student loan debt on the income based repayment plan (I have none).  Apparently if we filed jointly it would significantly raise her monthly payment so we have been filing taxes as married filing separate since we got married in 2017.  I thought the IRA income limits in that situation were the same as a single individual but I saw recently that a person married filing separate can’t contribute to an IRA if their income is more than 10K.  I’m way over that.  I’ve stopped all future IRA contributions but wonder what are the possible consequences for the contributions I’ve already made over the last 7 years.  Have I been making unauthorized IRA contributions for the past 7 years?  How far back might the IRS look if I get audited?  Should I try to fix this somehow or just keep my head down and hope no one ever notices?  Thoughts? ,2024-05-12T15:03:58+00:00

I have a ROTH IRA account with 20,000 that I want to withdraw in order to pay for a house. I also have Simple IRA and 401, so I'm not worried about the money in the IRA. 

However, from what I understand the ROTH IRA needs to be 5 years old to avoid penalty. Mine is not but I am okay with paying the penalty to withdraw the money. 

Would it be possible to withdraw the entire amount? Only 4k is actual contributions, the rest are earnings. 

If my research is correct, the 4k will not be penalized. The other 16K will be hit with 10% penalty and federal and state tax.

3. Remaining 9,000

Well, we have been separated for well over a year now, living at separated address. I was visiting him at his house and had save a folder with all my information in it. My social was written down, along with a couple W2's I didn't receive. 
My question is there anyway I can figure out how much we got back. He told me that they took it all because we owed some debt collector.. 

I'm also very, very suspious of him taking credit cards out in my name, filing disability when I do not have one. I think he might have borrowed money and got a car that he's been hiding from me. 
My phone is definitely tapped, I only get some calls and texts. 
I put my Sim card in another phone I had, the touch screen works for like 20seconds and stops working for like 2months before it does it again, but I put my Sim card in it and it like, 'ding, ding, ding' like 24 message came through, 14missed calls and a couple voice-mails. 
He also has my email hacked. 
He is very, very tech savvy and Im not really. I had seen an email one day, that said I had bought 500 dollar yearly subscription for Nord VPN. I've also received student loan emails and I had NEVER took out student loans. 
And wild off the wall thing is that my brother has a Masonry company and has noticed some weird stuff going on with his stuff and he did a video call with the IRS and they were saying he wasn't the owner of his company. He took a wild guess and asked them if it was my husband and he showed them a picture of him and they said that was who the owner was. 
My brother's partner and my husband got my brother falsely locked up and they thought he would be in there long enough to file the taxes and get them back.. then put the company back in my brother's name so he would get charged with fruad..
My brother had found forged copies inmy husband's hand writing and all kinds of shit. He's got an open on going case with that.. 
But my questions are, is there anyway I can call some and figure out how much we got back in our taxes? He won't tell me? And who exactly do I call to get confirmation that he took out loans. The credit card companies won't tell me anything.

Note you can also get a copy of the tax return the thief filed (it's supposedly ""yours"" after all) and from there you can start to work out what has to happen to unwind what they've done. The police will also want that as evidence on the report you filed. (If you haven't already notified the police, do that immediately. Go right now.) It's unlikely the address or bank account information on the return is going to lead the police directly to the criminal, but it can help get them a step closer.

-quarterly through the year

Or

-pay 100 % of what last years tax liability was (https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/basics-of-estimated-taxes-for-individuals

You still owe the same amount- the difference is if you will be penalized or not if you pay it now vs later.

Mean while, payment plan keeps taking $200 a month. 
Called IRS, they say because files jointly, main account is  under my husband ssn, therefore my payment didn’t register.  Said they are working on the app, call back after April 8th then customer service should be able to help fix this. I also asked about contacting payment plan, says they dont have that info, i can only wait, and there will be delay even after i pay everything. Asked what’s the remaining balance, he says nothing more than what I already know which is incorrect. 
We filed in april for 2023. No the balance still not refreshed dont know how much we owe, as soon as we filed, husband made payment 5k
Plus the payment i made earlier, and the payment plan, we should be good for 2022, again shows up on payment plan but balance remained the same.
since nothing is refreshed, interest or penalty  continue to accumulate on the 2022 9k +2021 100+
I can call IRS again and again but this feels wrong,

I've been able to figure out the CASDI-E, MED, and SS taxes since they're just flat percentages, but how do I calculate the CA tax and FITW tax on each of my paychecks? For example, one paycheck I made $1,574.62 and was taxed $34.94 in CA and $112.72 in FITW, whereas the next paycheck I made $1,822.21 and was taxed $48.47 in CA and $142.49 in FITW. I know it has something to do with different tax brackets, but I haven't been able to figure it out through Googling.",2024-05-12T07:54:21+00:00
Tax,comment,l3p3h45,VoteyDisciple,,"Your first $14,600/year of income is tax-free, so since you're paid every other week you can just immediately subtract $561 from your pay amount. There's no tax on that.

The next $11,600/year is taxed at 10%, which is $446 per paycheck. Your checks are always more than this, so you're just paying $44.60 on the whole $446. Easy.

That leaves a bunch of income taxed at 12%. There are higher income brackets, of course, but not for your checks. You can simplify your spreadsheet calculation quite a lot. You are always paying $44.60 on the first $1,007 of income (that's 0% of $561 and 10% of $446), and 12% on the rest.

Spreadsheet formula: ((gross pay minus $1,007) times 12%) + $44.60.

Obviously if you ever earn significantly more or significantly less than you're seeing on the two checks you reported here, this does not work. But if your checks are all more than $1,007 and less than about $2,270 this is a perfectly good simplification.",2024-05-12T11:22:23+00:00

Tax,post,1cq26cc,Mundane-Problem1253,"family member income 150k, paid 4k in income tax ?","i have a family member who is a life  coach.  they have books on amazon through a publisher, a podcast through apple/spotify, and online courses hosted on the Teachable platform. They also have a large TikTok following.   I believe the bulk of income comes from their one on one coaching sessions though. 

Was speaking to them today and they told me they made 150k for the year of 2023 but only paid 4k in income tax.  I asked how that was possible because I figure they would have paid closer to 40k in income tax ?

i think the gist of what they explained to me was as follows: all the platforms above i mentioned issue 1099k’s so they pay taxes on that and report it as income.  the life coasting sessions that get paid out over paypal and venmo they claim are “family and friends “ transactions. in a sense they are saying that any of their clients are just their friends and not reporting it as income.  Is this actually a legit way to avoid paying taxes ? I think their argument was that venmo/paypal are not business accounts and even if venmo and paypal issue a 1099 , it won’t matter because their clients are “friends and family “ just sending money to them and venmo
and paypal don’t have any context to
the actual sale.

the person who advised my family member to do this works in tax accounting apparently, which seems insane to me.  On one hand I understand that if they never got audited it does seem like they would get away with it. on the other hand , it seems like they would be in deep shit if the IRS caught wind of this?   i think the gist of this is their schedule C reported income reflects that they needed to pay 4k in income tax because the Schedule C doesn’t include any of the Venmo and paypal payments by “friends and family “

Also, this isn’t me. I am an engineer not a life coach, but really want to be after hearing all this today.",2024-05-12T07:19:03+00:00

Tax,post,1cq1adt,The-Fortune-Soul,Best Advice To Avoid Capital Gains Tax?,"To give a little background on the situation my fiancé and I are planning on buying land and using a contractor to build a home with my VA home loan in the next couple of  years. After much discussion, we’re thinking about having her parents move in with us by building them a separate small house on the land as well. Her parents are transitioning over into retirement age and we want them to be close while we raise our first son, and not have them worry too much about finances. I have a pretty decent salary and it’s only going to get higher. 

Her parents own a home so we’re thinking we might just sell the property and use the money as a down payment to build a dream home for us all. The thing is they bought the home for $196k and we’re looking at some serious appreciation value here. Similar homes in the area are selling for $875k-$1.2mil. They’ve lived at this home for 20+ years, and we want them to get as much value out of the property as possible. 

I’m still relatively new to home buying/selling and research is tough with a lot of conflicting information I’m reading online. If anyone has any advice towards the best method towards eliminating or at least mitigating the capital gains tax, I’d definitely be grateful.

Tax,comment,l3r9cn1,frenchiebuilder,,"There's no way not to; it's just how the penalty calculation works. Estimated payments are entered on a quarterly basis, and applied to that quarter's tax liability; but withholding is entered as a single total, for the whole year, and applied to your total tax liability, for the entire year. 

[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2210.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2210.pdf) 

First you subtract the entire year's total witholdings, as a single total, from the entire year's total tax liability, as a single total (line 6 in step I) 

Then, if the result was over $1k, you subtract each quarter's estimated payments & withholding\* from each quarter's tax liability. (line 15 in step III)



\* even here: unless you choose otherwise, *and can prove it,* each quarter's withholding is assumed to be 1/4 of the year's total withholding.

Throughout 2022, I had legal residency in a European country, where I spent the majority of the year, but was in the US visiting family for about 3 months. I may be disqualified from FEIE as a result, for which I claimed in previous years.

In 2023, I got rid of my residence lease in favor of doing the digital nomad lifestyle, living out of AirBnBs for extended periods. I spent about 3 months in the US in 2023 as well.

All that said, my visa for the European country is technically valid until 2026, so there might be a chance I can leverage for FEIE?

Total earnings as calculated from what hit my US bank in 2022 and 2023 are below, along with tallied AirBnB and rent expenses since I work from my domicile and believe I can use these as deductions.

2022: $108,961.93, I have a formal 1099 form from only one of my clients, which is listed as $58,750. Could I potentially just use this number? The rest of the $ was calculated by going through my monthly bank statements from 2022 and reviewing how much came into my account each month. Not sure if that is necessary or to only go with what there is a paper trail for.

2023: $118,064.68

One other comment told you to increase your withholding or make quarterly payments, but if you want to save on taxes I'd advise the opposite for the first year. Make sure to withhold 110% of your 2023 tax, not more if you can avoid it.

Tax,post,1cpwb45,godisavyomnaut,Capital loss harvesting ,"Hi all,

I live in the US and work for a US company that had a private RSU buyack program. The company closed its buyback program in q1 24 after it's stock price fell by >50%. I was granted stock at a high price in q4'23 and was left with no choice but to sell it at a loss. In all I've incurred about 60k worth of loss due to this forced sell position I was put in


Anyway, ink ow we can deduct upto 3k in losses every year but I don't want to do that since what would take me 20 years to erase this loss.

My questions are.
1. Is this a short term loss? I think it is because I acquired it in q4'23 and sold in q1'24 but correct me if I'm wrong 

2. I believe I can use short term profits to erase short term losses this year but can subtract this short term loss against long term gains as well? (assuming I sell some long positions this year) 

3. Can I subtract short term capital loss against crypto short term gains?

4. Suppose I was only able to subtract 20k of my losses this year, can I subtract these losses against the profits I make next year?

4.1 if yes, would this still be considered a short term loss in next year carryover?

4.2  if yes to 4.1, Can that be subtracted against long term gains next year?

5. Lastly, I live in California, and can't figure out the loss harvesting rules for California

Taking it a step further, the IRS could come back and say, “we don’t care. You’re not allowed to have that $1.14. Pay us taxes”. They would assess you, assuming a 37% marginal rate, $0.42 of tax. Annnnnd….. it got rounded to $0.

There are three super improbable things that I’m not qualified to talk about (and I’m barely qualified to talk about the above because I don’t work in tax controversy), but you could (and I stress the improbability of could):
1) have some sort of penalty assessed for “using” both at the same time. (Not usual unless there’s an indication of bad faith)
2) Interest on the….. $0 of tax (lol) [note interest would be likely if you did owe tax, penalties for late payment maybe depending on the amount]
3) The absolute nuclear option the IRS could throw would be the complete disallowance of HSA contributions for the year. I really have no idea what this would entail. Would you have to remove the money from the account? Penalty tax? I have no clue. Chances are the IRS will take the smoothest route to compliance which is reversing the ineligible FSA benefit.

Tax,post,1cpt887,bennywithaplan,Calculating federal income tax... am I doing this right?,"Hi all, I want to calculate income tax on a portion of my reported income and just want to make sure I am doing it right.

Long story short, my spouse's name is on a couple interest yielding savings accounts with her parents. Additionally, she is the owner of a property (gifted from her parents) that is currently being rented out to tenants and collecting rent. However, her parents are collecting all of the interest and rental income (it is their retirement fund). We do not see any of the money and we end up paying the income tax on this income every year. Her parents do not want to pay it (even though they are in a lower tax bracket than us) and she doesn't want to make this a big deal with them. But I want to calculate it just so we know how much we are paying in case it ever comes up. Every year we end up owing federal taxes because we're not withholding enough, mostly due to this extra income.

This last tax year, they earned \~$12k in interest and \~$25k in rental income which we ended up claiming. We are in the 24% tax bracket (file jointly, gross income was \~$340k). Is it as simple as taking 24% of the $37k to calculate the income tax owed?

Say you buy a house. You rent the basement with a kitchenette out for 7 years. Then you have kids and get the basement renter to move out for kid stuff. Then you live there for 25 more years before selling. You never rented again.

Technically, due to the rules, as I understand, you would need to do depreciation recapture (whether you took it or not) for those 7 years you rented your basement 25 years layer when you sell.

Likelihood that the depreciation recapture will happen? Low.

Likelihood that they will get caught? Low.

Tax,comment,l3p4rf8,wutang_generated,,"It's a timing difference and one that the downside is capped if they held it long term.

Consider the example you provided. If the house was purchased in ~1990 I'll use the median US home price of about $120,000. Land might be 25-30% of that and the basement might be 10-20% by square footage, so I'll estimate the basement at $18,000. RRE depr is about 3.637%/year ($655/year) so 7 years is $4,583. They would get to offset $655 of income each year (reducing their taxes). 

They sell today, median home price is $425,000. Maybe now their tax rate is in the top bracket too. Their total gain is covered by the MFS 121 exclusion. The recapture on the $4.6k is capped at 25% or $1,150 of tax. On $305k of untaxed cap gains that's not all that bad.

In other words, if you purchased the house for 100k and the land for 30k, your basis is 130k. Land is not depreciable, so only the house itself would have been depreciate at roughly 3.4% per year during the time it was used for business. Let’s assume it was only used as a rental for 3 years, 3x3.4% = 10.2% or 10,200. That means the remaining basis in the whole property was 119800 (130,000 - 10,200). Therefore, upon sale of the land at I’m guessing 60k (for this scenario), you have total loss of 59,800 (119,800 basis - 60,000 sale price).",2024-05-12T02:39:22+00:00

This year I decided to go to someone local who is registered to file taxes. I filed taxes with her march 20th she originally told me my refund due was $168. I didn’t think much of it because I was partime last year. Fast forward 4-10 weeks of processing go by and I received a letter from IRS needing more information to verify myself. This was not surprising considering the IRS always have me do extra verification. When I called into to verify the IRS agent was telling me how my refund amount was not the correct she is seeing and advised me to look at my 10-40. While looking at the 10-40 my tax filet sent I saw it was missing half.  The tax filer then told me “I am currently moving so I’m out of office but I can loo up your actual refund amount which is 927” I’m confused since that way more than 168. She then proceed to tell me “My company fees which is 499 starting  plus you did owe” that does not sound right giving I didn’t owe plus I never claim tax exempt. Ever since I keep requesting for the full 10-40 she been giving me the run around saying “I will send next week”. This all red flags to me, I’m not sure what would be the best steps.

Tax,comment,l3ninli,varthalon,,"An LLC really isn’t a thing as far as how taxes work. Typically, unless you’ve actively applied with the IRS to be treated differently, if the LLC is just you or you and your wife you are taxed as a Sole Proprietorship on your personal income taxes. If you have other members in the LLC it is taxed as a partnership.

Utah, and I think also Idaho, are ‘Marketplace’ states rather than ‘cost of performance’ states. Depending on the nature of your business marketplace states often consider the income from your business to be sourced where your customer is, rather than where you are.

If you are taxed as a sole proprietor your Utah sourced income is taxable in Utah and all of your income is taxable in Idaho (with a credit for the taxes paid to Utah.

If you are taxed as a partnership the LLC is required to file state partnership returns to both Utah and Idaho to show what portion of the income came from which states and went to which members. Utah allows the Utah partnership return to count as your personal income tax return for Utah if the LLC is your only source of Utah income.

Having your LLC registered in Utah doesn’t really matter for Utah tax purposes if you are already doing business in Utah since you’d have to file Utah tax returns anyway - but being registered in Utah does require you to file Utah returns even if you aren’t doing business in Utah (no tax due tax returns) and can cause a headache if you haven’t filed those returns and in the future accidentally let your registration lapse. Because of that I’d recommend you file articles of domestication with Idaho to move your LLC to Idaho.",2024-05-12T01:23:26+00:00

Tax,comment,l3nn8pz,varthalon,,"Having boxes 15-17 blank is indeed the employer saying they did not withhold any state taxes for you. Double check your pay stubs to make sure that is also the case with them.

Three possibilities come to mind on why: 

 1. You may have told your employer not to withhold state taxes. Check with your HR or payroll office to see. 

 2. If you moved to California and didn’t tell your employer or the information didn’t make it to the HR/payroll department so they don’t know they should be paying California employment taxes for you. 

 3. Your employer is committing employment tax fraud with California. Especially if your employer is not based in CA and you are their only CA employee. Having an employee in CA subjects an employer to a lot of regulation and CA taxes beyond just your withholdings. If your employer is doing this they are also almost certainly also not paying into CA unemployment and disability insurance programs for you which could screw you later. They may also be avoiding reporting you to CA because having an employee in CA subjects them to CA corporate income taxes and sales taxes. ",2024-05-12T01:58:47+00:00

Tax,post,1cpk3dq,hcs892,Confused about “effectively connected income”,"I have a situation that is confusing (to me) and my accountant hasn’t been very clear about it. 

I’m a self employed permanent resident in the US, and will be leaving in a few months to move back to the UK permanently. I’ll also be surrendering my permanent residency when I’m back in the UK.

Currently, I make music and release my albums online through distributors, and then get royalties for the streams and sales of my music. The distributor that sends the payment is based in the USA.

When I move back to England I will be continuing to do what I do, but I will be registering as a sole trader there instead. The US and UK have a dual tax treaty, which means I could fill out form W-8BEN so that I don’t get 30% taken at source when I’m back in the UK - but that’s only if my income is not considered “effectively connected” to a trade or business in the US. 

The albums I made in the US will still be sold and streamed online, so I’ll continue to get money from that. As I made the music and released the music in the US, are royalties from sales and streams of that music considered effectively connected income, even though I will now be conducting my business activities in the UK only, and the income is from sales / streams that take place while I am in the UK?

I really hope not as I don’t want to have to file and pay US taxes for the rest of my life!!

Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks!

Edit: for clarification, I currently reside in the US and report my music income on Schedule C. When I surrender my green card, I will cease to be US tax resident and will start reporting my income to the UK as a sole trader. What I’m asking is, if the transaction (e.g. sale / stream of music) that generates to royalty occurs while I am UK resident, but it’s the sale/stream of music that was recorded and produced while I was in the US, is that Effectively Connected Income? I.e. if I released an album last year, but next year someone buys it when I’m back in the Uk, would the royalty from that be “effectively connected” to my business activity last year? If the actual transaction takes place when I’m not US tax resident? 

Also note, this is not my main activity - I have a full time W2 job so the music is something on the side.",2024-05-11T15:32:58+00:00

OP's post does not use the words ""allowance"" or ""exemption"" at all.  He uses the word ""deduction,"" which is on the W-4.  Line 4b.

>THEN, if you still think you need to further tweak your withholding, you can do so with either line **3** (an extra child) or **4(b)** (additional nontaxable income).

I would not make a false claim about an extra child to reduce my withholding.  I would use Line 4b to enter an expected deduction.  If you were ever questioned about that in an audit, you can always say oh well I expected to have that high of a deduction, but then it turned out at the end of the year I did not.  But there's no way to explain saying you had a child you did not have.  Also I'm not sure about the term ""additional nontaxable income.""  It's not additional income, it's a deduction from your existing income.  Line 4a is for additional income (not from jobs), but an entry on that line would increase, not decrease, your withholding. 

>As you can read for yourself at the top of the form, Form W-4 goes to your employer, not the IRS, and is used to ""guide"" your employer to withhold the correct amount of taxes throughout the year.

Tax,post,1cpdj43,Ahmed_Yassin_Truggl,sales taxes in Delaware,"Hello everyone,

I am a Tunisian residing in Tunisia. Last month, I decided to start my own LLC in the US. I heard good things about Stripe Atlas, so I chose to go with them. I've enjoyed using Stripe's services for the past month; it's been a great experience.

Here's some information about my business: it's registered in Delaware, and I received the EIN on April 13th. We've started processing invoices directly, selling services for creating VSLs (Video Sales Letters) for software companies. We don't have any shipping involved in our business.

From my research and discussions with an accountant, I learned that in Delaware, there's a 0% sales tax rate and an 8.7% tax rate paid on net profits, which should be filed before April 15th every year, the end of the tax year.

So far, everything is going well; we're making money, and our earnings are going to our bank account smoothly. We use tracking software for our finances, recording every expense with the receipt to avoid problems later on with bookkeeping.

However, recently I encountered a problem. A few days ago, we had a payout for a couple of invoices we processed. I received an email from Stripe stating:

""Hello,

Stripe Tax has been monitoring your transactions for Truggl, LLC to check if you have any tax obligations. A tax obligation means that you need to start collecting sales tax, VAT, or GST in a specific location.

Based on our records, you may need to start collecting tax in the following locations:  
Europe: Estonia, France

Check out the tax obligations monitoring dashboard for more specifics.

To start collecting tax in these locations, there are a few steps you’ll need to complete:

* Register with the above locations to collect tax
* Copy your registration information to Stripe.

If you have any questions, you can contact us at any time by email, chat, or phone.

— The Stripe team""

What I understood from this is that I should collect sales taxes. However, everyone knows that Delaware is a sales tax-free state, meaning no sales taxes should be collected.

I checked the Stripe dashboard, but I encountered a problem when trying to register the company to start collecting sales taxes. I received the message:

""Delaware doesn't have sales tax.  
You don’t need to add a registration in Delaware because there’s no sales tax in this state. Learn more by reading our US sales tax guide.""

Let me give a quick scenario:

Company X sells services for $1000, registered in Delaware, and using Stripe.

* Company A, based in Estonia, wants to buy the services.
* Company B, based in France, wants to buy the services.
* Company C, based in Delaware, wants to buy the services.

How much sales tax should each one pay, and is it an obligation to collect them?

I can't seem to focus on my work with this in mind. We haven't processed a significant amount in the last 30 days, but I know it will become a big problem later if I ignore it. Taxes can be complicated.

Thank you,",2024-05-11T09:24:18+00:00

There is no straightforward answer to this. You'll need to work out what your tax obligations are in the jurisdictions where you're selling for the specific products and services you're providing.",2024-05-11T12:36:17+00:00
Tax,comment,l3kjygz,jbcascpa,,"As the other individual mentioned sakes tax rules vary from state to state country to country, but to add some extra clarity, Sales tax (VAT as it is referred to in many countries outside the US) in many cases is based on destination not production. Meaning, if you are in Delaware but your customer is in California, the sales will be based on California sales tax, and sales tax will be owed to California. 

Now here is the kicker, just because you have a sale in a particular state does not mean you now have an obligation to register and and remit sales tax, that occurs once you have what is called nexus. Every state has different nexus thresholds. For example, some states have it based on dollar volume of sales while others have a qty volume of sales threshold. Once that nexus threshold is passed, you must register in that state to collect and remit sales tax. 

Here is another twist, it sounds like what you do is service based and not goods or merchandise. The taxability of services also varies from state to state. In some states, services are completely exempt from sales tax and, in some states, services are taxed with some exceptions.

As you can see, sales tax can be incredibly complicated and by using a sales platform that does not have a built in sales tax tracking [Amazon automatically collects, remit and files your sales tax returns on your behalf] you have now added extra monitoring and administration of sales tax/vat to the management of your sales. Then, to make this even more complicated, you are selling overseas in other countries, which further complicates the issue. 

I highly suggest either hiring an accountant who understands foreign and US sales tax requirements or a service such as avalara to support your sales tax tracking needs.",2024-05-11T13:12:24+00:00

Your IRA contributions each year are reported on Form 5498 by your financial institution. The IRS receives a copy of this form, but you should also keep your own copies in case you're ever audited.",2024-05-11T06:19:24+00:00
Tax,comment,l3kk8pw,nothlit,,"Form 8606 is required to be filed if any one of the following things occurred during a given year:

* You made a nondeductible contribution to a traditional IRA
* You took a withdrawal from a traditional, SIMPLE, or SEP IRA after having previously made nondeductible contributions
* You did a Roth conversion from a traditional, SIMPLE, or SEP IRA
* You took an early withdrawal from a Roth IRA

If all you did was make regular contributions to a Roth IRA, there was never any reason to file Form 8606 in those years. You just need to file it for the year you take the withdrawal.

The IRS knows you are only withdrawing contributions because that's what you tell them when you fill out Form 8606 Part III for the year of the withdrawal. Like many things in the tax code, the IRS takes your word for it (""under penalty of perjury""), although they also have supporting documentation they can use to verify (i.e., Form 5498 that's been filed by your IRA custodian every year).",2024-05-11T13:14:37+00:00

Tax,post,1cp41xx,Plastic-Display5970,Very high income this year and unsure about how to handle taxes.,"I got a new job late last year with a very nice pay package (Base salary and RSU's).  I had no RSU's vest last year.  However, right after I joined the stock exploded.  My finances are typically pretty simple, but this massive increase in income is making me stressed about taxes.  Looking for advice on what I can prepare for.

Last years AGI: \~700k

Details (with new job):

* California
* All income is W-2. We both claim 0 and select the option for spouse having job.
* All retirement accounts maxed out between us.
* Married filed jointly
* Combined base salaries: 550k
* Commissions (spouse only): 150k
* RSU's:  Grant of 800k 4-year vest (50k/quarter)
* RSU valuation today: $2.4M
* Projected Total Income: $1.5M (700k salaries, 800k RSU vests based on consensus of analyst projections for stock)

 I haven't done RSU's in many years and know that they'll only take out a small portion for taxes.  I do not intend to sell any vested shares.  I do have a short-term capital loss carryover of about $100k, but that's the only ""special"" thing we have.

I recognize this is a good problem to have, but I'm still stressed about it and don't want to get in trouble.  What can I do to prepare?",2024-05-10T23:57:28+00:00

Tax,post,1cp3wbb,24Rangmilan,Excess Roth IRA Contribution Removal for tax years 2022 & 2023,"Both my wife and I had excess Roth IRA contributions for tax year 2022 as follows:
Excess contribution - Self: $7000Excess contribution- Spouse: $4476
I removed the excess contributions for 2022 this year in April 2024. Per my broker, as it was past the tax deadline (including extension) of Oct 15, 2023, I just need to remove excess contribution and pay 6% penalty on excess before Oct 15, 2024, tax deadline, which I plan to do shortly.
 
Further for tax year 2023, I again had excess contribution of $7500 in my account and $207 for my wife's Roth IRA. which I removed before tax deadline (including extension) of Oct 15, 2024.
Now all the excesses having been removed both for 2022 and 2023, my following questions relate to how to report removals and any associated penalties.
Q.1   Do I have to file amended tax returns for 2022 or just paying penalty on forms 5329 for my wife and myself sufficient? It is being suggested by certain sources online that I have to file amended tax return for 2022 and forms 5329 even when nothing is to be amended on my return itself, which does not make whole lot of logic. So, if I submit forms for myself and my wife with penalties to IRS, would it be meet IRS requirements?
 
Q2.  For 2023 removals, since excess removal is considered distribution in the year it is removed (2024 in this case) and would be reported on 1099X by my broker in 2025, do I need to do anything at this time (before Oct 15,2024 extended tax deadline) with respect to 2023 taxes, such as filing amended taxes for 2023 or form 5329 for 10% penalty of about $5 due to early disbursement from my wife's accounts as she is below 59 1/2?
 
Q3.  Any guidance on leveraging my TurboTax tools to help me sort through this and file appropriate forms.
Q 4.  Anything else that I may be missing?

Finally a general question - I filed taxes with Turbo tak. Now for amendment would turbo tax walk me through the process and forms to do th eamended taxes if needed?",2024-05-10T23:49:59+00:00
Tax,comment,l3jd51p,jgleigh,,"You can file Form 5329 without amending your 1040 return. It's setup to be filed separately. You need to file it for 2022 and 2023 since you owe penalties on your 2022 contributions for both years.

The 2023 removals should be reported on 2023 taxes. The distribution is tied to the tax-year, not the calendar year. You won't receive the 1099-R until 2025, but you're supposed to report it now. The 1099-R you receive in 2025 will be coded as prior year since it's for a 2023 distribution, not a 2024 distribution. There is no longer a 10% penalty for early withdrawals when they're due to a corrective distribution.

For 2022 I think you only need Form 5329. For 2023 you need that same form, but also need to amend your main return.

    (a) General rule
    In the case of an individual who pays qualified higher education expenses during the taxable year, no amount shall be includible in gross income by reason of the redemption during such year of any qualified United States savings bond.
    (b) Limitations
        (1) Limitation where redemption proceeds exceed higher education expenses
            (A) In general 
            If—
                (i) the aggregate proceeds of qualified United States savings bonds redeemed by the taxpayer during the taxable year exceed
                (ii) the qualified higher education expenses paid by the taxpayer during such taxable year,
            the amount excludable from gross income under subsection (a) shall not exceed the applicable fraction of the amount excludable from gross income under subsection (a) without regard to this subsection.
            (B) Applicable fraction
            For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “applicable fraction” means the fraction the numerator of which is the amount described in subparagraph (A)(ii) and the denominator of which is the amount described in subparagraph (A)(i).

Because $10,000 of bond proceeds exceeds the $9,000 in qualified education expenses, not all of the proceeds from the bond redemption are tax-free.

Then it goes on to say “if we don’t hear from you by June 13, 2024, you won’t receive tax deferment benefits. If you don’t file your return on time and pay taxes due, you may be subject to collection action for taxes, interest, or penalties.” It says we need to fill out additional paperwork. 

I called and the rep told me that as far as she could see, we didn’t need to submit anything else and she doesn’t know why we received the notice, but she wanted to refer me to a specialist to be sure and transferred me.

Once she transferred me, I just heard a message that they don’t answer questions about this topic anymore and to go look for myself online. Then it hung up. My question is why I was sent this notice and nothing online has told me the answer to that. The online information only says exactly what is in the notice and nothing more, so it’s completely unhelpful. I would like to just take the representative’s word for it that she *thinks* we don’t need to take action, but I don’t really like doing that when it comes to something as important as taxes. They are the ones who sent me the notice, I would just like to know why, but I can’t get a straight answer.",2024-05-10T21:59:01+00:00

Tax,post,1cp1otb,ExistentHumanBeing,Help? Trying to claim 2020 stim for 4 years. Recent check reissue didn’t go through. Deadline may 18,"have been trying to get a stimulus check reissued since 2020 when I lost it. they told me I had to find it. I found it well over year later in my safe under the mat.they had also sent a letter saying it expired and to call them to have it reissued and I did…but… I have been calling since and I met with a roadblock turn. whether they’re not satisfied with who I say I am, and all the information that they have me give them to verify my identity,or they say they want the check sent- but somebody else says they don’t want it need it sent and not to do that- somebody said don’t turn it in unless you get a check re-issued, somebody else said destroy it then call… Somebody said don’t ever destroy it until you get a check.. often they don’t have any clue get upset, and hang up on me. so one of the last times that I called, I got the rudest person of them all I won’t go into detail, but, they told me I wasn’t who I say I am. because I couldn’t tell them the last time I filed taxes. I told them that- I have not and I’m on SSI and I filed through the nonfilers tool and 2020 for the first check, and after that, it was all automatic directly deposited into my account.. apparently that was me not knowing….they told me I need to get a hold of my transcripts and hung up on me. I got a hold of my transcripts and I found out if I moved ( which I did) I need to fill out a form for an address change, or the check would go to the wrong address. so I did the address change and sent it by certified mail,called them as soon as they got it April 25. I finally got somebody that was nice and they told me they reissued the check for me. That They didn’t understand why nobody issued it all this time, because it was “so easy”. They told me it would be here in a week, but they had to tell me that it would be here within 4 to 8 weeks because that’s what they have to say. It is now May 10, I haven’t got it so I called to verify that it was sent.-the deadline is coming and it felt too good to be true. The person told me over the period of this call, that they weren’t experienced with stimulus checks.. and that they were really confused. They didn’t really know what to do. They said that it was never issued. They tried to tell me I received it. I told them I didn’t. then, after long holds..They told me that was issued on the 25th, but it was being held because I”needed to have filed a return”. I asked- ""A return for what?” they said-“ for the year 2020” I said “I filed through the nonfilers tool.” So, They kept going to do research. They told me, many things-it might be best to send it in, do not send it in or destroy it without having one re-issued, a 3911 might work- then that the 3911 won’t work, then the 3911 will work and that’s what I should do. I asked if I should file one 1040 form like it says all over the place to do. I was told no, but I wasn’t told exactly why… I figure if she saying that I didn’t file a return.. when I did, the 1040 form would be the way to go? But also, I did file a nonfilers so maybe I shouldn’t fill it out? but maybe it would at least be some thing that will stop them from claiming it on the 18th- letting them know officially that I am trying to claim it? I asked her- how can I let them know that I am trying to claim it, because it is the weekend, I have seven days.. after the weekend I have less than that. And I can’t do anything in the weekend. I’ve been trying to do this four years and I’ve been blocked every turn. I thought I had it figured out and a check was being sent and then I called today and I find out that it’s not. I only have a couple days left. What can I do to stop them from claiming it? she didn’t really know. She suggested that I sent the 3911 form through fax while I’m on the phone with them and they can confirm that they got it. But that would require me be at a fax machine-at a local store- and on hold until someone picks up at the irs for 2 hours in their store. and who knows if the 3911 will even work. She also told me to go to my local IRS office by getting an appointment and going in with the 3911 form filled out, the expired check, and the letter saying that my check expired.. but to get an appointment or do anything at all, won’t be until Monday.. then whenever they can get me in… the irs have basically screwed me right out of my own check for 4 years up…until I couldn’t do anything about it anymore…Can anyone tell me anything I can do, or should do?",2024-05-10T22:10:06+00:00

Tax,post,1cp0xqe,DezzaDKully,Filing 1099 Taxes Quarterly when you also have W-2. Help!,"Hello! I have been researching all morning and am still unclear on the best move. I am working a 1099 contractor job where no taxes are taken out. I should make around $40,000 for the year. BUT, I also work a W-2 job, where taxes are withheld, and I'll make about $53,000 from that per year. My spouse (married filing jointly) is also working a W-2 job and makes around $67,000 per year with taxes withheld. 

Because I'll have two W-2 jobs with taxes already removed on my tax return... do I need to pay 1099 taxes quarterly? I feel like it might end up evening out at the end of the year since I have always received a tax refund after filing. If I was only working the 1099 job, I would plan to file quarterly... but not sure what the best move is in this situation. 

I appreciate any insight and please forgive my tax ignorance! ",2024-05-10T21:37:36+00:00
Tax,comment,l3hs4mh,VoteyDisciple,,"You don't specifically need to make quarterly payments as long as the tax withheld from the two W-2 jobs is enough to cover your full tax liability ***including*** self-employment tax on the 1099 work.

You're looking at $5,600 of self-employment tax and $9,600 of income tax. Were you getting $15k tax refunds before? If not, you will need to increase your withholding to make this work.

But you can absolutely do that! There's nothing whatsoever wrong with just telling your employers to withhold more tax from your W-2 paychecks to cover the added $15k of tax.

Tax,post,1cp0ttd,Feisty-Ad129,Worried my accountant may be lying to me...,"Hello! I'm in an odd situation and need some advice. Hope this is acceptable on this sub, if it's the wrong place for something like this please feel free to delete.

After submitting my taxes for 2022 last year, I got a very large penalty bill for late payment. I was confused, and went back to my accountant, who told me that he had filed in late April but had requested an extension. He said that the fee was because I hadn't been paying quarterly taxes for my business, but that it was likely it could be removed and that he would file an abatement.

About six months passed, and I kept getting escalating notices from the IRS and state saying they would seize my property my I don't pay. I was getting nervous, but my accountant assured me it was just taking a while for them to process the abatement request. I asked for a copy of the abatement request, and he sent me one dated around the time he said he filed it.

I keep getting these escalating notices, and today I finally called the IRS about it. (I should have done it sooner.) They said the fee is just for late filing, that that no extension had ever been filed, and that my taxes were not filed until June 6th. (My accountant had said they were filed before the end of April.) They also said they had never received any abatement request at all.

There are some other weird red flags with my accountant. He's been preparing my taxes for 10 years, but two years ago he stopped with with H&R Block and went solo, and things have been weird. Just this past April, he ghosted on my entirely while I was waiting for him to file -- he finally showed back up on April 15th, after I sent him increasingly frantic and angry emails, and filed (supposedly?) on time. He's just seemed messy in general lately.

He insists that he did file the extension and the abatement, and that this is just the IRS being behind and being a mess. He says there's no way can prove he filed the request for abatement, but he sent me the letter, which is dated from November. (Of course, that's just a date on a piece of paper, he could have written it today.) He says he can prove he filed the extension, but he hasn't shown me anything yet.

I'm nervous about this and not sure how to proceed. Is it at all realistic that the IRS would have missed the request for extension and the request for abatement? My late filing fees are over $10,000 between state and federal. Does anyone have any advice on what might be happening here, and what I should do?

Tax,comment,l3i98ey,BillionaireGhost,,"So the big questions are:

Did he file the extension? You need to see a copy of the extension filed and see if he has any proof that the extension was accepted. If you have this, you can reply to the IRS and let them know that you *did* extend the return.

Next, did you owe money when that extension was filed, and did you make a payment? If so, you’ll want a record of that.

Your accountant does sound disorganized and it’s possible he failed to file the extension and he’s just jerking you around about it.

*But,* the IRS is also sometimes disorganized and I’d say 80% of the notices we respond to from the IRS are literally something we filed that the IRS hasn’t gotten around to processing, or one department has it but the department sending notices doesn’t know.

I say that because it’s possible, like very realistically possible, that your accountant filed the extension, filed the return, wrote a letter requesting an abatement, and all of that is just floating around in a weird backlog at the IRS. They *do* get busy and sometimes fail to process things in a timely manner or lose track of stuff.

That said, if he’s even a somewhat competent accountant, he should have everything that you and the IRS needs to see and be able to furnish you with copies. If he doesn’t have that, it’s a problem, you need ti take matters into your own hands and find a new accountant to sort it out.",2024-05-10T23:55:35+00:00

Tax,post,1cozec9,hayakiu,College Tuition on Taxes Questions (TX),"ETA: I am 23 and a part-time student

Me and my parents are currently in a predicament regarding writing my college finances on our taxes and how to handle it.

My parents cannot claim me on their taxes due to me making too much money, but they are paying my tuition and college finances. Due to this, they cannot use the Education Credit but I can.

How can they still pay for my schooling and I still write it off on my taxes?

For example:
— Would my parents be able to give me the money for my schooling and then have me pay for it using that gifted money so that I can write it off on my taxes?

Now, I read about a tuition gift tax exclusion, but I don’t know if it can have the education credit applied to it. What I know about it:
- It is only applicable to TUITION (not books, supplies, housing, etc)
- The tuition MUST be paid directly to the institution by the gifter, not by the student
- It is exempt from the annual gift limit (I believe it’s $18,000). Due to this, do they need to fill out a 709 if they exceed this amount, even if this type is exempt from the limit?

Questions regarding that:
- The tuition paid by the gifter: does it need to be written on my parents’ taxes or is it written on mine? Or is it not written on any taxes? 
- Can the education credit be applied to it?",2024-05-10T20:32:43+00:00

All the mumbo jumbo about gifting money here is irrelevant. If you are truly not a dependent based on the circumstances (it sounds like you’re dependent), you can still claim the education credit for yourself if your parents paid for it directly.",2024-05-10T20:44:03+00:00

Your parents can pay the tuition directly to the school and it will not be considered a gift and there will be no need for them to file the gift return. 

To calculate how much goes towards the credit - look at your 1098t. Take the number from box 1 and add any books or required supplies that you purchased. Then subtract box 5 from this number.  Use this new number for the credit. Any more than $4000 will not increase your AOTC credit. Any more than $10,000 will not increase your LLC credit.

You are allowed to claim the expenses even though they are paid by a third party. Think parent plus loans, fafsa etc. Payments made on your behalf to the school are considered gifts.

Tax,post,1coy31b,ernsten,IRS Withholding Calculator - Bonus & Radius,"My spouse and I have been having trouble getting our W4 tax withholding correct. In 2022, we owed several thousand dollars. We overcorrected by adding withholding for my gross rental income and received a refund of several thousand dollars this year. I was thrilled to see the IRS release a calculator so we can get it right in 2024.

For those who have experience with the calculator, should I include my gross pay from my paycheck for “wages and salary to date”? I know there’s a separate entry later for bonuses received so I wasn’t sure if i should just include my regular salary or the total amount I’ve been paid. My gross pay also includes RSUs that vested this year but the deductions in my paycheck include an offset of about 2/3s the value. I’m not sure how to handle it.

In the last year since May, I have been solo traveling and living out of my vehicle working seasonal and part time jobs in California and Washington. I have probably worked for at least 5 different companies in the last year and I am now suffering from the lack of forethought while I was filling out I-9 information for each company when hired on. Because I did not have a home address, I listed different addresses including a parent's, friend's and sibling's for my W-2s to be sent. I am unsure of the status of these W-2s. I have minimal knowledge on tax information and really just need help on how to approach this situation. I understand I missed the tax filing date and I do qualify for filing my taxes. I feel confused and overwhelmed by this process and want to make sure I get this complete. 

Can I/should I contact each of my previous employers and have them send my W-2s to a single mailing address? Can I find the information I need to file my taxes somewhere else without contacting my previous employers?

What other things am I missing or not considering? Will I encounter unforeseen fees or penalties? What considerations should I make moving forward with this lifestyle?

Tax,post,1coxa3m,AnonymovsUser,State Capital Gains Tax,"My situation is as follows — I am a 22 year old college senior graduating in May. January through May I lived in Indiana while at school. In June I will be living in IL at my parents’ apartment in Chicago for a month until finding my own place to move into July 1. I will be supporting myself & living alone July through December, and will therefore be filing as independent. My parents own a home in CA and are considered CA residents. Outside of a 4 day visit to CA in late June, I will not otherwise be stepping foot in the state this year. My bank accounts and car have been linked to IL since the start of the year, and in early May I received an IL ID and registered to vote in the state.

In January, I realized a capital gain on the sale of stocks. I plan on realizing another gain at some point later this year. My ultimate goal is to avoid paying tax on this gain outside the federal tax and IL state tax which I believe I will owe. My understanding is that once I am considered an IL resident, I would only owe IL (and not CA or IN) state tax on any capital gains. Is this true?

Moreover, when would I “officially” be considered an IL resident? At what point could I realize a gain and only owe IL state tax? Would I owe CA state tax at all on the gain I realized in January?

I know this is a lot and I am contemplating consulting a tax professional. Outside of not really knowing how to go about finding one, I’m not sure my situation is even as complex as I think it is, so any and all help would be much appreciated :)",2024-05-10T19:02:19+00:00
Tax,comment,l3hgn80,penguinise,,"You established a new domicile on the date which you moved into your ""own place"" in Illinois.  If you were not previously an Illinois resident, then you became one on that date.  If your move into your parents' apartment was part of an intent to permanently relocate to Illinois (your plans were definite as of that date, you were just looking for an apartment), you could move back your date of residency to your first day in Illinois.

Generally, your prior residence would be your parents' domicile, although the fact that you spent a month at a residence of theirs in Chicago is confusing.  Were you ordinarily resident in California prior to your temporary absence to become an undergraduate student?  Would you still have returned to California but for your status as a student until you graduated and got a job?  Assuming the answers are yes, you remained a California resident until you moved to Illinois.

For sourceless capital gain such as from the sale of stock, the income is taxable to your state of residence.  If you were a California resident in January, then that gain is taxable to California.  Gains later in the year, when you are an Illinois resident, are taxable to Illinois.  If you were never a resident of Indiana, the only income taxable to IN would be wage income (if any) you earned while working there, or other sourced income.

Finally, note that CA is subject to a lot of extremely misleading propaganda about it being ""high tax"" and unless you are quite rich indeed, your CA tax rate will be lower than your IL tax rate anyway.",2024-05-10T20:44:08+00:00

Would it be possible to argue that I have been an IL resident the entire year?",2024-05-10T20:51:25+00:00
Tax,post,1cox320,Tannhauser1982,Is a 529 state tax deduction this easy?,"My younger relative is starting college in August at a SUNY school. His dad and stepmom also live in NY state.

NY allows joint filers to deduct a total of $10K of taxable income per year by contributing to a 529 account. Since four school years are distributed over five calendar years, that permits up to $50K of deducted income, which would save them $3K at a 6% marginal rate.

They have savings earmarked for college, but none of that is currently located in a 529 account. It seems to me that they could simply move money into a 529 shortly before each semester's bill is due, and pay all the college bills out of that account.

Are there any problems with this plan that I’m not seeing? It feels like saving $3,000 shouldn’t be this easy!",2024-05-10T18:54:06+00:00

Tax,comment,l3hqh9u,rcecap,,"Yes - any NY state taxpayer contributing to a 529 account that they own for the benefit of a designated beneficiary can get annual NY state income tax deduction of up to $5k per single / $10k per married couple filing jointly. 

Definitely an easy way to save NY state income taxes each year. Many states (30+) have similar tax deduction / tax credit benefits for 529 contributions.

Heck, even the grandparents (or anyone willing to contribute) can open up their own 529 account for the same beneficiary and get the same tax deduction if they meet the above qualifications. 

However, given the short window expected between contributions and withdrawals, the money should be allocated to a short-term yield-oriented fund among the 529 investment choices (https://www.nysaves.org/home/funds/1003019.html). 

This is to avoid the risk of losing money from being invested in stock or bond funds during unexpected stock market declines or bond value declines from unforeseen rate increases during those short windows. Of course, you also won’t benefit from potential GAINS in value from any stock market / bond value increases during that window.

Normally the point of 529 accounts is to enjoy long term tax free compounding / tax free withdrawals for qualified expenses. But for taxpayers and 529 account owners in many states, it’s still a good idea just for the state income tax deduction.",2024-05-10T21:46:37+00:00

I have never paid money in advance of my taxes to the IRS before. I think I am aware of quarterly estimated tax payments that can be made during the year but is that the only way I can do it? Can I just log into my IRS account say in August 2024 or September 2024 and pay and make a transfer from my bank to the IRS say maybe 3/4's of what I am estimating my taxes might be?

Right. I would be guessing what my taxes will be for 2024 in September or October of this year. And the point of paying say 3/4th's of the estimate of my tax bill in September or October of this year would be so that I do not have a large withdrawal from my bank account. That's my only issue.

>Paying on a tax balance is only for when you know the amount that's due at the time of filing.

Right. If I understand you. If my tax bill for example for 2024 is $100 and I sent the IRS $75 in September of 2024 with the purpose of telling the IRS in September of 2024 Hey, IRS, here's some money that I am paying on my tax bill to be applied to my taxes due April 2025 then after I run my taxes through FreeTaxUSA next year and FreeTaxUSA sees that I paid $75 already it will spit out that I still owe $25 in taxes.

The IRS charge Interest and penalty to those who did not pay enough tax each pay period or each quarter. The same way, IRS will pay you interest on top of your refund if they were late in processing your return.

IRS says in their web site:

  
We charge interest on penalties for **late filing, late paying, over or understating valuations, and substantially understating the tax you owe**. Also, we charge interest on fraud and accuracy-related penalties from the later of the return due date or extended due date.

Does the IRS charge interest if you make payments?If you can't pay the full amount of your taxes on time, pay what you can now and apply for a payment plan. You can enter into an Installment Agreement to pay the remaining balance. **Interest will continue to accrue daily on any amount not paid, including on both penalties and interest**.

  
Why is the IRS charging me a penalty?Taxpayers who don't meet their tax obligations may owe a penalty. The IRS charges a penalty for various reasons, including if you don't: **File your tax return on time**. Pay any tax you owe on time and in the right way.Mar 26, 2024",2024-05-11T12:47:41+00:00

Tax,comment,l3jats6,resisting_a_rest,,"Not sure, perhaps those who are down-voting my post can reply.

One thing I can think of is that you can get in trouble in situations where you lose your job and have no income towards the end of the year to withhold.

Also, you can't withhold more than you are being paid in any one paycheck, so it's not like you can withhold $10K in the last paycheck if it is only for $2K.  And some employers will only allow you to withhold a certain maximum percentage.  Also, I believe your employer must withhold a minimum amount, you can't change it to 0%.  But you may be able to lower it (if it is not at the lowest already) by changing your W-4 so the minimum amount is taken out instead of declaring dependents, etc.  So perhaps that is why I am being down-voted since you probably can't withhold ""all your paychecks in December"" unless you have other sources of income in December to do so.

I personally have an inherited IRA that I must take an RMD from each year, so I have 100% of it withheld in December as well as have any additional amount I need withheld from my monthly maturing treasury bills during the last 1 or 2 months of the year through Treasury Direct.  Treasury Direct allows you to specify up to 50% federal withholding and you can easily change it before each T-Bill matures.

Of course you have to be careful and make sure you know exactly how much you have to withhold for the year to avoid a penalty.  It's easiest to withhold 100% of the tax you owed last year (or 110% of that amount if you made >150K), as that is an exact specific amount.  Otherwise you have to be sure to withhold at least 90% of the tax you will owe for the current year, and that can be more difficult to calculate, particularly if your income is not predictable",2024-05-11T04:52:55+00:00
Tax,comment,l3lnbx3,BallsDeepInYourMommy,,">110% of last years total tax owed if last years ~~income~~ **AGI** was over 150K.

It's an important distinction. Total income could be 200k, but after personal deductions like SE tax deduction, QBI deduction, health insurance premiums deduction, and of course income deferral, one could easily have an AGI below 150k. So the gap could be pretty wide and it's important to understand that AGI is what determines it not income per se.

Tax,comment,l3kn9hu,resisting_a_rest,,"Be sure to research that what I'm telling you is correct, don't believe one random person on Reddit.

Also, there may be details that I didn't mention or forgot about, so be sure not to go about this blindly.

I used to not understand how this worked, and for a few years paid much of my tax by January 15th using a single estimated payment to put myself over the needed minimum to avoid a penalty, of course this was wrong, and while I somehow got away with it for a couple years, I eventually ended up having to pay a penalty.

That's when I researched and found out that estimated payments had to be ""timely"" (paid after each quarter in which you earned the income) but withholding, as long as it was withheld within in the tax year, is considered to have been paid evenly throughout the year.

One thing I've thought about is what if I have a big windfall in February and get a lot of income, but then the rest of the months are a lot less income?  In that case, even if the withholding in December is considered evenly paid over the entire year, it would still, theoretically, be worthy of a penalty, since I should  have withheld a lot more in the first quarter than I did in the other quarters.
To be honest, I have never had this problem, and I'm guessing it is something the IRS would penalize you for if they had a record of when you received that income.

Also, I don't do this with my regular paycheck, it is mostly done with my interest/dividend income from my investments.  I withhold the regular amount from my paycheck, I just don't have withholding from my T-Bills and other investments until I need to near the end of the year.  I believe most people don't have taxes withheld from investments and instead do estimated tax payments (so much so that when I do my taxes with FreeTaxUSA, it warns me that there may be a mistake as most people don't have taxes withheld on their 1099 forms).  To be honest, I don't know why most people do estimated taxes instead of withholding from their 1099, and I might be missing something.

So, just letting you know I am no expert at this, so before you do anything drastic, research or consult a CPA.",2024-05-11T13:37:48+00:00

What? Line 24 is your total tax. That's **completely irrelevant** to what I'm saying. That's what the 110% is applied to. But only people with higher than 150k AGI are subject to the 110% rule. You said their INCOME has to be above 150k. I'm saying this is strictly speaking FALSE. They must have an AGI above 150k in order for the 110% rule to apply.

I'm specifically correcting the part where you said

Tax,comment,l3ggtni,TRBigStick,,"All W2 income (bonuses included) is taxed using the progressive tax system.

The reason it *appears* that bonuses are taxed at a higher rate is that your regular income “fills up” the lower tax brackets when your employer calculates your tax withholding. Then when your bonus gets added on top of that as supplemental income, it gets taxed at the appropriate tax rate above your regular income.

So if your employer could predict exactly what your bonuses would be throughout the year, you’d just see more taxes withheld every paycheck. But since bonuses aren’t guaranteed, they’re taxed on top of your salary.",2024-05-10T17:05:53+00:00

Tax,comment,l3ggjnu,nn123654,,"This is primarily because of how the withholding formula works. Basically they assume on each pay period that you will make the same amount of money on every other paycheck throughout the year and take out taxes accordingly.

This means that if you get a large lump sum distribution they will take out more taxes than necessary. For instance in this case on this paycheck they are going to pay taxes as if you were making $286,560 per year assuming semi-monthly pay (24 pay periods per year).

It's not until the end of the year that you have the final reconciliation and that they determine your actual bill. When they do you will get all the money back as a refund if you overpaid. Alternatively you can calculate your total taxes you expect to owe and give them a new W-4 that withholds the correct amount. See [irs.gov/w4app](http://irs.gov/w4app) for this.

Another way you can do this is look at your total tax due [line on your 1040 (](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf)currently line 16 in 2023) and then compare this to the total taxes you would be withholding through the rest of the year, and set the amount accordingly using a [paycheck calculator](https://www.paycheckcity.com/calculator/salary) adjusting box 3 and 4(b) until you get the right amount.",2024-05-10T17:04:16+00:00

I’m looking for a dose of reality.  I am a CFP and am considering adding an EA to my designations.  I hang out with CPAs a lot and always joke that I went into the wrong business.  Everyone is full-if I have a client who needs a CPA, I generally have to call in a favor to get someone to help them.  I make sure to never send difficult clients to people I know.  If a client doesn’t need a CPA, I don’t have anywhere good to send them for tax prep.

Am I nuts?  Tax time is already pretty crazy for me.  Here’s my tentative plan:

Join the same firm my brother works for and convince him to handle most of my book during tax season (I’ve been considering joining this firm for a while).  Get EA. Spend the next tax season working under a CPA I highly respect, where I can get a lay of the land and figure out software.  Hang my shingle as a CFP/EA (I know the board likes the little ®️ but I don’t know how to do it).

Pub 587

If you can show by adequate records or other evidence that the depreciation you actually deducted (the allowed depreciation) was less than the amount you were entitled to deduct (the allowable depreciation), the amount you cannot exclude (and must subtract from your total gain when figuring your exclusion) is the amount you actually deducted.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the taxpayer can establish by adequate records or other sufficient evidence that the amount allowed as a deduction for any period was less than the amount allowable, the amount taken into account for such period shall be the amount allowed.

However, if the full amount allowable would not have been limited, you would claim the amount allowable even if nothing were claimed.

In my opinion, the only time depreciation would not be recaptured would be if the home office deduction was not fully allowed (because the income was already below zero or would have been reduced below zero by the home office deduction) or because the taxpayer claimed the simplified method for the home office which specifically excludes it from depreciation.",2024-05-11T02:13:37+00:00

When my paycheck jumped to $300 the following week, the taxes taken out jumped from 8.76% to 13% but it did not include a breakdown of what was deducted. Any insight would be useful. How is this determined and why the margin of percentage of tax taken out larger with a larger check and not a stagnant 8.76%. 

Thanks. :-)

Tax,comment,l3f354w,nothumbs78,,"Each paycheck you should receive a detail of how the amount you receive is calculated.  If you don’t, ask for it. 

Gross wages are calculated as your hourly rate multiplied by your hours. Then there are at least three, most likely four, taxes withheld from you and paid to governments on your behalf. The two easiest taxes that are withheld are Social Security and Medicare taxes. Social security is 6.2% and Medicare is 1.45% of your gross wages. 

Then you have Federal and most likely state withholding. Federal is highly variable but based on what you filled out on your W-4 when you started. That tax withholding is basically an attempt to withhold the amount of tax that would be due on your annualized wages for the year. State withholding is the same, but usually about 7-9% of gross wages. 

Many assumptions made and I didn’t get into all the exceptions like pretax deductions, but this is generally how your payroll should work.",2024-05-10T11:51:18+00:00

Tax,comment,l3f5a7v,I-Like-To-Talk-Tax,,"The main variable tax withholding is federal income tax.

So, for each paycheck, you get some variables from the paycheck itself, and a document called a W4 gets plugged into a formula, and the tax withholding number pops out. That is then withheld from your check.

To not do an ""in depth"" analysis of the formula here is an overview. 

Say you get paid 50, and it is a weekly payroll. The formula will multiply that 50 by 52 for each week to ""annualize it."" Then, it runs a striped down version of the federal tax return using inputs from your W4. The formula will say that if you worked that much all year, you would owe ""X"" in tax. Then it divides X by 52. So X/52 is withheld from your paycheck. 

Say you now get a 600 paycheck. The formula is run again, and you get X/52 withheld.

2 notes.

1. The formula is run independently. This means that what you got paid last week has no influence on your withholding this week. You get withheld on this week the same, even if you got a 1 million dollar paycheck last week or a 50 dollar paycheck last week. 

2. US Federal tax is progressive, so you pay a higher percentage when you make more. Think of your wages as a stack of money. You stack all the dollars you earned over the year in a nice neat pile. The first inch is tax-free. The next two inches are 10% tax. The 2 inches after that is 12% tax as so on. The taller your pile, the higher the percentage of the next dollar they take in tax. So when you have your $600 paycheck week, the formula is guessing you will have a bigger pile at year end so it withholds a bigger percentage. 

Final thing. The paycheck wothhold for federal income tax isn't the end all. That formula is guessing and will not be 100% correct. The tax return we file at the end of the year is us all stacking up out money and seeing how much we actually owed. If you had too many withholdings during the year, they refund you. If you had too few, you owe.",2024-05-10T12:08:38+00:00

Tax,comment,l3f4wbs,vynm2,,"Each paycheck will have several different taxes withheld: 

1. FICA taxes:
   1. Social Security, and 
   2. Medicare
2. Federal income tax, and
3. State income tax

FICA will be a set percentage of each check -- it's 6.2% for SS and 1.45% for Medicare.

Federal and State income tax typically depend on the amount of your check and how you completed your withholding form (W-4 for federal, state will depend on the state).

What your employer effectively does each pay period (separately for federal and state income tax) is:

* look at your paycheck amount, 
* multiply it by the number of paychecks they pay in a year (12 if monthly, 24 if semi-monthly, 52 if weekly, etc) to get the annualized amount,
* subtract your standard deduction from the annualized amount to determine how much of your income will be taxable,
* apply the tax brackets to that annualized amount to determine the total annual tax you'll owe on that income for the year, and
* divide the annual tax amount from the previous step by the number of paychecks they pay in a year. This will be the amount they withhold from your paycheck that pay period.

They don't typically do all of the math each paycheck-- there are tax tables they can use that do all of that for them, but the details above are basically how those tax tables are created.

Note that this basic method assumes that your W-2 income from that job is your only income for the year. If it's not, then the other fields on the W-4 you complete help them make necessary adjustments to what they withhold.

You can find the federal tax tables used in [IRS Pub 15-T](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15t.pdf#page=12). Page 12 if you're using the current W-4 from 2020 or later. Page 27 if you filled out the old W-4, from 2019 or earlier.",2024-05-10T12:05:33+00:00

Plus the consequence of the 9 years unreported imputed interest (which was technically gifted to B, but below the reporting threshold).

Then in 2024, they report a gift of 150k + imputed interest for that year (because now the imputed interest + gift are Over 18k).

B takes 150k cost basis in the shares.



Or

File a 2015 709 and take the consequences of failing to report the gift timely. If they're ever even asserted. But that might be more expensive than the first option.

B has 100k cost basis in shares.

Or

Just treat it as a gift of shares with a 100k cost basis in 2024. 100k gift reporting, 100k basis in shares for B. No taxes paid. But A has committed tax fraud. Though B's in the clear. 

Another issue to consider is who the holder or record of the shares where from 2015-2024 and if there were dividends, who received and reported them. Also, if the shares were pledged by B as collateral.

In other words, A needs a good tax attorney. Their benevolence could really cause them some problems. Both for what they've done, and any potential screw-ups ""fixing"" it. 

If B has never realized any value from the shares. Voiding the loan and returning the shares might work. After which, A could gift the shares with 100k basis in 2024. But that's a long shot.",2024-05-10T04:45:19+00:00

Tax,comment,l3dkvzp,Fun_Horse_4735,,"Not an audit. Revenue Officers are field tax collectors. They primarily collecting delinquent taxes, but also collect delinquent returns. 

I used to be an RO, but left that gig a while ago, so things may have changed a bit.  

They may ask you to provide financial information either over the phone or in writing. That would require completion for IRS form 433-A.  The RO may also ask you for bank statements. If you owe a bunch and can’t pay it, they will ask for more documents. 

If you have your returns ready, if I were you I would wait until you talk to the RO and offer to send them that day. You could even send them to the RO’s address that is on their letter before the call, but I personally wouldn’t.  When they receive your return, the RO will give it a quick once over.  Good chance they will make sure your numbers line up more or less with the sources they have internally for income (W-2s and 1099s) and just verify that the return “makes sense”. They wouldn’t audit you though, they would go ahead a process the returns (date stamp it and send it for inputting at a service center), but if the returns seem inaccurate, they would refer you to be audited. 

The biggest thing, assuming you have ALL of the delinquent returns done, is to be able to pay the balances (if any). An RO can help you get set up for an installment agreement (payment plan), assuming you have filed all of your returns. But, they are also the people who file federal tax liens, levy bank accounts (take the money out), seize houses and other property, etc.  If you are due a refund or owe a little and can pay it, you don’t have anything to worry about. Just do what the RO asks you, when they ask you and you will be fine.

If you don't file, the revenue officer will enter an estimated return based on your income and then collect based off that. You would first get a bill in the mail, and after not responding, may receive further collection actions.

The substitute return will show that your cost of goods sold is $0 and may omit other credits or deductions you are entitled to.

(Coincidentally, I was talking with a colleague about this process recently and they said that after the substitute return is filed, it actually tends to get reassigned to a different revenue officer to follow up on collecting. But either way, once it is filed, the collection can start.)

If you do file, that should end the current involvement of the revenue officer, if they want to audit your filed return that would be a different group within the IRS, and if you don't pay the balance due on your filed returns, it could eventually be reassigned to a revenue officer for collection.",2024-05-10T10:24:12+00:00

Tax,comment,l3exg6d,Fun_Horse_4735,,"When I was doing the job, Revenue Officers were required to make first contact in the field (your home or place of business) and did not send you a letter first. We showed up and knocked on your door. The unannounced part has changed, but I believe RO’s still have to do the first substantive contact (beyond just scheduling the appointment) in person. 

There are a few reasons for the in-person contact.  One is that in-person makes it more real for the taxpayer and moves things more quickly.  Often people have gotten multiple notices by mail from the IRS and ignored them.  

RO’s primarily work balance due cases, as opposed to delinquent (unfiled) return. The procedures are written with balance due situations in mind.  So, field visits and in-person contact are very helpful in collecting the delinquent tax. The RO will visit the home or business to see if you still live there/if it’s in operation. They can get a sense of how much it is worth. They will visit the local court house/register of deeds/etc to see who owns the real property. They will take an inventory of what is there to seize and sell (vehicles, inventory, real estate, etc). They also can have you sign things like the 433-a that I reference earlier. That is signed under penalty of perjury, BTW. If you tell the truth, that’s great. If you don’t, well, that’s great too because now you have committed perjury and are intentionally trying to conceal assets from the government—makes it easier to seize your property, refer you for criminal prosecution, etc. 

You say you don’t make much but you sell online. What were your gross sales from the online selling?  That’s probably why your cases was kicked to an RO.  When the IRS prepares substitute returns, they typically will include all of your reported income (including things like selling income on a 1099), but will give you the minimum deductions. So, if you sold $100k but had $90k of perfectly legitimate expenses, the IRS will include the $100k of income but $0 of expenses if they do it for you. 

Sometimes we knew why cases were assigned to us and sometimes we didn’t, beyond of course, knowing what was delinquent. It is possible it’s a training case, but possible it isn’t. I worked an area of my state for many months that was very rural and simply didn’t have many businesses. We also were supposed to work both individual and business taxpayers. Yours could just be the next case up, if you will, on the individual side.  

The RO assigned to your case isn’t evaluated on how much money they bring in or how many delinquent returns they collect. Their goal is to follow procedures and close the case quickly. It really doesn’t matter to them if you are owed refunds and the IRS sends you a check or if they collection a $1 million check from you.",2024-05-10T11:00:41+00:00

law, where the concepts have been developed and refined by the courts. The Supreme Court has inter-
preted “trade or business” for purposes of IRC § 162 to mean an activity conducted with “continuity and
regularity” and with the primary purpose of earning income or making profit. (https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2013-ARC_VOL-1_S3_MLI-2.pdf)

And according to (https://kahnlitwin.com/blogs/tax-blog/do-triple-net-leases-qualify-for-the-section-199a-safe-harbor) it seems that as a business the NNN qualifies for QBI.

I noticed, after seeing my 2023 tax return that my 2022 tax return was incorrect. I did review them but I don't understand anything and our taxes are easy: two W2 (one each) and some change from a contracting job I have. So I did not questions ANYTHING, and even if I did... I don't have the knowledge or education on those matters, they don't test you on tax filing when applying for a green card!

My CPA basically inputted all of my husband's W2 info, except for his income. So that's a 39K missing from our 2022 tax form.

Only found out a year later. She had us amend our taxes and told us she'd help pay because she felt bad.

I finally got my letter from the IRS, the amount of nothing I expected, over 15K when we only made 84K together and have 2 dependents. I've never owed taxes and always had a tax refund. I'm just lost. This amount seems wayyyyyy too high! Especially when you consider that my 2023 taxes come with a refund and I haven't gotten it, I thought they would just keep it and deduct it?! 

I'm worried about the interests and the penalties too. Is my CPA going to pay those?

You might be able to get the penalties abated.

And if there are any that can't be abated, the CPA said she was going to help you pay, right?

>What are my options? I'm looking for someone else to look into this, I'm sick to my stomach and looking at becoming a surrogate or something because this is not money we have as newcomers to this country.

**Don't panic.**

This may be a bit of a process to get fixed, but it's fixable. And it sounds like your CPA is on top of getting it fixed.

Worst case scenario: After everything gets amended, any adjustments made, etc, you're still left with a tax bill. If that happens, you start making payments, have your CPA assist with setting up a payment plan if it makes sense to do so, etc. If the IRS decides to go forward with collections - and again - we're talking absolute worst case scenario - they could garnish paychecks, levy bank accounts, take next year's refund too, etc, until it's paid.

There's a possibility, depending on how much of that $15k balance is tax, how much is penalties, and what kind of penalties, that it could go down considerably once everything is dealt with.

That notice with the $15k balance... can you post a redacted picture of it?",2024-05-10T00:31:02+00:00

My family needs a bigger home and it fits perfect. Let’s say it is worth $1 million. We can afford 50% downpayment, but would rather not take out a loan for the rest. They need cash to buy a new home and to live off of. How can we structure it to avoid any taxes/loans? Here is what I’ve thought of:

1. They gift the house to us, we give them the cash for their home and provide monthly payments for the other half of the home value.
2. We buy their new house, they will their house to us so we get it when they die.
3. We set up a trust or something like that.

Should also note that there are other shady siblings that want “their cut” when parents die. Not trying to cut them out, but want to make sure we structure the arrangement such that there is zero chance of the other siblings crying foul and trying to take what it rightfully ours.

Tax,post,1cobzat,shedfigure,Removal of Excess Roth Contribution - Vanguard,"In Jan 2022, my wife and I both contributed the max $6k to our Roth IRA accounts. At the end of the year, it turns out we are above the MAGI limit to be eligible for Roth contributions. I am able to recharacterize and backdoor for myself. Easy.

My wife had a large Rollover IRA,however, and rather than fight with pro-rata stuff, we just decide to do a removal of excess contributions for the full $6000 (with the understanding that any earnings would be taxed). I used Vanguard's Removal of Excess Contributions portal to do so. Thought everything went off without a hitch.

Fast forward to today, I receive a letter from the IRS showing a $4,783 distribution that is taxable. I go check the 1099-R for that account from that year which shows the following:

Box 1 (Gross Distribution): $4,783

Box 2a (Taxable Amount): $0

Box 7 (Distribution Code): 8,J

Box 16 (State Distribution): $4,783

Go back to my bank records for that period, sure enough that $4,783 ended up in my checking account. The remaining $1,217 stayed in the Roth IRA settlement account. The IRS is now attempting to tax the $4,783.

So I've got a few questions:

1) Why was the $6k split up like that and only part of it distributed?

2) Why does the IRS see this $4,783 as taxable? Even if this was not a removal of excess contributions, should this not be viewed as removal of principal and thus not taxable?

3) What should be my next steps here? I am assuming contacting Vanguard, but with their run around, I would like to go in with a clear strategy and instruction on what they need to do to make any fixes.",2024-05-10T00:02:08+00:00

Yes, just the uninvested cash within the Roth IRA.

1) I'm now leaning towards the $47xx being what remained after losses from the year (was invested in in VTSAX for essentially the full calendar year), so vanguard did do that calculation correctly.

2) See original post for what showed on the 1099-R for that account. I did not fill out Part III of 8606 because according to the instructions, removal of excess funds when the removal occurred before the due date of of my tax return for the year in which the contributions were made, so should not have been included.",2024-05-10T11:35:10+00:00

* You can gamble by still recording as expenses, but under scrutiny you will be held accountable. Keep in mind, that you have to issue 1099's. If you don't, that is a red flag.
* Convince to obtain ITIN number

You do realize that you are breaking multiple federal laws (immigration and tax laws included)? Federal government is large and slow. They may overlook your tax return for years. However, if you are picked as a target, you the laws will be applied to you to the full extent for multiple years.

While it seems as a remote possibility, there is a chance your illegals one day will sue you for social security and if they sue you, you will have to pay it as well.

Tax,comment,l3g7462,Hot-Ic,,"Here is how it works in this situation:

- If someone provides you W9, you will end up issuing 1099.

- If 1099 is later not included in somebody's tax return, the identity victim will alert IRS. He will be in trouble. At some point IRS will contact you.

- You are risking additional scrutiny if you were involved in fraudulent recordkeeping, even it it is not your fault.

Best advice is the following: refuse to even work with lying and dishonest people, who lie at the very beginning. Our society is based on trust, and you are blessed to have healthy instincts.

Now to answer your direct question: if you have doubts, you should ask for verification of all the data in returned W9. If somebody is providing SSN, you can ask a copy. For address, they should provide drivers license. If it is EIN, you can ask for IRS issuance number. If it is a legal entity, you can check legal entity database in your state.

Final advice: just refuse to complicate your life with tax fraud. Issue them accurate 1099, and if they want, they can lie on their tax returns.

This is common sense.

I had a flooring client (not for a long - for one year) who employed illegals. He paid them cash, never issued 1099's. Last time I have heard from him, when he was selected for the state audit for not collecting and paying sales taxes (multiple years). I have no idea how he ended, but I assume that IRS can expand and refer to other parts of IRS. Employing illegals is risky. If there is a workplace accident, our judicial system will disregard the fact that the person is illegal, and will hold you accountable.

I am sure you know all the theory, however complying with IRS is the easiest part.",2024-05-10T16:09:42+00:00

I’m a 28F. I haven’t done my taxes in years (I filed this year through H&R Block). I haven’t updated my car registration in years despite moving to two separate states. I haven’t been the the dentist in a decade. I have credit card debt piling up. I think a medical bill was sent to collections, but no idea how to check on that (went to finally pay online but it isn’t there. It was from a billing mistake, so maybe the issue was resolved?). My out of state ID expires in July so I need to address it, but I fear doing so will open the flood gates of the taxes I’ve avoided doing. 

I’m currently living in TX. I’m finally addressing my biggest flaws (avoidant behavior and addiction), and now I need to face the consequences of my actions. 

I have no idea where to fucking start. I’m more than willing to pay for someone to help me, but H&R Block has been ass. Should I get a lawyer? Is it something I can handle myself if I find proper education resources? 

I’ve beaten myself up over this for awhile but have finally reached a point where I feel able to be vulnerable and ask for help. Any guidance would be so appreciated. Please withhold any judgment. I know I fucked myself. I’m ready to face the damage I’ve done but really don’t want to hear how stupid I was. I’ve told myself that enough.

Find a tax professional to help with the prior year tax returns. Be prepared to talk to a few and see who seems like the best fit.

And yeah H&R Block, Jackson Hewitt, Liberty, basically all the big chains, more or less suck.

>Should I get a lawyer?

Maybe... but my reason for saying that isn't about the taxes, but rather the credit card debt.

If the credit card bills and other debt truly have you in over your head, interview a couple bankruptcy attorneys. See if it makes sense to go that route or not.

>Is it something I can handle myself if I find proper education resources?

Also maybe.

Specifically regarding 2020.. if you're due a refund for your 2020 taxes, time is running out to file and still get that refund. So, depending on the situation, it may make sense to pay someone to do your 2020 taxes, and to teach yourself how to do the other years.

Ask around for recommendations for an CPA or an EA. No lawyer needed. Then set up an appointment and give them your background. Personally I think you need someone who has a policy of making contact every year to remind you. I’m not sure about other CPA firms but we send all our clients a tax organizer in early January. That’s your little “ping” tax documents will be coming. Then some time late March/early May we call or email the clients we haven’t heard from. Ultimately it’s your responsibility but if you can find a firm that reminds you I think it will be a great help for the first couple of years. 

You might bite but your dentist won’t. Again, ask around for dentist recommendations. Ask specifically for a compassionate dentist. Listen carefully to the person’s description of their dentist.

 Easiest one to find out is the medical bill. You should be able to call the company the medical bill is through and they should be able to tell you about that. If it is in collections they should of told you via letter or email depending on the company. 
The registration will be a bit hard if you need to switch your registration to your current state I don't know how easy that will be but it might be extra fees.

Tax,comment,l3gjjsp,Far_Swordfish5729,,"I’m not a tax professional but have had two family members do this or parts of this. Here’s what I would suggest.

1. Move to your current state formally. That’s not hard really. You need your current car title and drivers license and proof that you live at your address in TX. A lease or utility bill is fine. Take that stuff to your closest drivers license service center and get a Texas license. There’s often no test for a current license holder beyond the basic eye exam thing. You just give them your old one, pay the fee, and they hand you a new one on the spot. The car - similar thing. Check in advance if there’s a tax for registering an out of state vehicle so you’re prepared. Some states charge sales tax based on the vehicle’s blue book value. Get TX insurance before you go in so it’s in their system. Just call your carrier and tell them you moved; this may change your rate if your new address is higher risk but often does not. If you can’t complete registration on the spot, nothing will happen. You just need to come back when you have whatever’s missing and finish. When you have your new plate, mail the old one back to the prior state.
2. Dentist - Just go. If you brush regularly it’s probably fine or nearly so. If you don’t have dental at work, you may want to wait until ACA enrollment this fall so you have coverage. Depending on income, you may be able to sign up with TX Medicaid sooner. Just check your situation.
3. Credit cards - Depending on your credit and budget, you can sometimes transfer balances for an up front fee that comes with 0% interest for a period after that like 12 or 18 months. BofA used to do a 4% transfer fee and then no interest for the first year. You can also get unsecured consolidation loans for less than cards charge. If you can offer security like real estate the interest will be a lot lower. It’s about getting into a cheaper loan and discharging it. Easier said than done but that’s the idea.
4. Taxes - Because most income sources are required to withhold tax, you’re probably not very screwed at all unless you were self employed or have a ton of investments. Your taxes probably aren’t that hard if you’re a typical person. You can buy prior year copies of Turbo Tax. Just start at the first missing year and start doing returns. File state returns in the appropriate state for that year. If you moved mid year, your resident state is where you spent the most time and you file two state returns based on what income was earned in each state. Whenever you’re due a refund elect to apply it to the next year’s return so you carry the cushion forward to avoid any underpayments. The program will calculate any penalties. At the end pay or receive what’s due. You’ll have to file by mail at the end. If you do not have documents for a prior year, you can request IRS transcripts that will show what was filed with them for that year. If you agree with what’s on the transcript and have nothing else, it’s not hard to turn that into a tax return or go through and request what you can from people based on the transcript. The whole thing is tedious but gets repetitive fast and then you file a stack of returns and are done. Respond to any questions they mail you. They tend to reserve their hammer for actual cheaters and want you to be current. I’ve found them to be understaffed but pleasant enough. If you have a massive bill or something goes wrong seek help. You don’t need a lawyer to file five years of back W-2 income they already know about and that taxes were already withheld on. I helped a forgetful uncle do six back to back returns. We had docs for recent years and could match those up with transcript entries for the older years. He owed some state money and got some federal money back.

The H&R Block/Jackson Hewitt/Liberty Tax's of the world basically specialize in overcharging for a simple tax return, and promoting a high interest refund advance. The less someone sounds like that's what they're doing, the better.

If you specifically ant someone to work with face-to-face, limit yourself to local pros. If you're okay with doing everything remotely, some preparers take clients from all over the country, so that widens your search some.

I didn’t know much about it but it was recommended to me because at the time I had an S-Corp and was doing a lot of 1099 freelance work. I was also working W2 work. Originally I was contributing to it via my business checking account which represented monies earned and untaxed. When I dissolved the business, I started contributing to it via my personal checking. These were post tax wages earned. I probably should have rolled all this over when I dissolved the business but I was ignorant, perhaps willfully, see as I’m more of a creative than a “good with money” guy. For a long time the money just sat as uninvested cash. During COVID, I had some time on my hands so I started investing in mutual funds, ETF’s and stocks. Definitely felt like an idiot for not doing this sooner since the I would have done better even having this money in a HY savings (neither here nor there). Flash forward to now…my wife and I got hammered on taxes for ‘23 and now owe thousands to Uncle Sam (I got a new full time job with a significant pay increase). Our retirements are the only real savings we have and so here’s the question: Do I liquidate the SEP IRA and pay the government? Second, do I need to take tax hit on the early withdrawal if most of the cash in this account was transferred post-income tax via w2 wages? Isn’t that a double tax? Did I already screw myself by putting any post tax money into this account?

Mostly right. except in extremely rare circumstances an automobile is sold for less than was paid for it, resulting in a loss. But since it was a ""personal use item"", it isn't a taxable loss and has no impact on your federal (and likely state) income tax.

Quick question! So I go to a CPA that prepares/E Files my taxes which was done. 

I have direct deposit and specifically ask for it to go to savings for both state/federal. Never had an issue before!

1. I just got my state refund today which is great! However it was deposited into my checking account? It was marked correctly on my return for savings so I'm curious how that's even possible, if anyone has ever had that happen?

2. My federal is pending to savings. I did ask why my refund amount was slightly different then my return said and their answer was their system doesn't always show change. Example: refund 100.00 on return but deposit is 100.36. Is that weird?

The TCS in TCS Treas 449 stands for ""Treasury Check Service,"" which is the name of the service that the Bureau of the Fiscal Service uses to distribute federal payments, including tax refunds.

The refund may be the result of overpayment of income taxes, excess Social Security taxes, or other types of federal taxes. It is important to note that the amount of the refund may not match the amount that you expected to receive, as the government may have withheld some or all of the refund to pay off any outstanding debts that you may owe, such as back taxes or student loans.

If the IRS succeeds in reversing it then the IRS can’t get interest on the repayment.

A lot of people in this situation don’t know about the interest charge and get very annoyed when they have to add it to the check they send to the Treasury. Whenever money is deposited into your account in error (whether by the government or a private party) the end result will be the same: it’s not your money and the rightful owner is entitled to get it back.

Original taxes for my Dad were filed incorrectly to include income from stocks sold after his death that were in the trust. Then they were amended so Dad’s income was his own and trust filed but didn’t use step-up basis so over $45,000 paid in to federal and over $10,000 paid in to Virginia. 

Asked them to amend them again to use step-up basis and the tax attorney send a copy for approval before sending in second amendment. On both the federal and state taxes he didn’t fill in the line for already paid in. (line 25d Federal and line 28 Virginia) This creates a loss of about $500 federal after a $44,000 refund and he has us paying $700 to Virginia instead of getting the $10,000 refund. 

This was from an email from my attorney… (He agrees with your evaluation and conclusions.  However, he explained that Virginia, unlike some other jurisdictions, does not require that an amended filing work out the difference between the prior return and the amended return – that is handled by the Department of Taxation, which will compare the respective returns and, where appropriate, issue a refund. While he agrees with your rationale for a VA tax refund, is disinclined to change the amended return.)

What is the likelihood that Virginia will just refund the overpayment of over $10,000 since he is again sending in a payment? Will he need to file a third amendment? Why won’t he just fill in the amount already paid in?

That is simply inaccurate for the vast majority of group health plans. You may want to go back to them with Pub 15, which lists which fringe benefits can be excluded from taxable wages:

>This exclusion applies to contributions you make to an accident or health plan for an employee […]


>Accident or health plan. This is an arrangement that provides benefits for your employees, **their spouses**, their dependents, and their children (under age 27 at the end of the tax year) in the event of personal injury or sickness. The plan may be insured or noninsured and doesn't need to be in writing.

There are a few uncommon exceptions (eg if their self insured and you’re highly compensated) but they should be able to point you to the specific reason.

Tax,comment,l3cno03,VoteyDisciple,,"You do have to file a tax return in Massachusetts. On that tax return you will report that you had $0 withheld for Massachusetts. You now owe them ***all*** the tax for the year, in addition to any penalties and interest due for not withholding during the year. This is sad for you and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it.

Meanwhile, Virginia has a whole bunch of your money that you don't actually owe them. You'll need to file a non-resident return on which you report that you earned $0 in Virginia, and yet withheld a bunch of tax, and they will then refund that tax to you (just like any other time you've withheld too much tax).

In order to do that, your employer needs to issue a corrected W-2. They cannot change the ***withholding*** amount (Virginia already has your money; it's too late to do anything about that). They can and should change the ***income*** amount, though. You need a W-2 that says you earned a bunch of money in Massachusetts and had no tax withheld, but earned no money in Virginia and had a bunch of tax withheld. Because that's the truth.

Finally, they need to stop withholding Virginia tax from your checks. You are employed in Massachusetts. You will not owe tax in Virginia unless you are traveling there for work.

Here's where it gets dicey: your employer may resist registering as an employer in Massachusetts. This is not optional for them, though. They cannot legally employ someone in Massachusetts if they are not a Massachusetts employer. You're entitled to the same benefits and protections as every other employee in Massachusetts; the fact that your employer owns a nice office building in Virginia is utterly irrelevant. 

Some employers are great about this and it's a complete non-issue, especially if your employer is a large company. On the other hand, there's a chance they will now realize they cannot legally employ someone in Massachusetts.",2024-05-09T22:41:53+00:00

Tax,post,1co54r5,horrible_noob,What is your wildest case of having to fire a client?,"I picked up a client in early 2021, schedule C, nothing too crazy. Referred by a bookkeeper, did a Zoom meeting with him (I was working remote at the time). Seemed like a cool guy. Filed the return and everything was great. Gave him his estimates for 2022 and called it a day.

Fast forward to 2022. After sending my quarterly newsletters (containing reminders to pay estimates), sending out my annual questionnaire, and sending 3 follow-up emails with questions that only he had to address, I finally hear back.

From his bookkeeper. I email the client and say: ""I appreciate your bookkeeper emailing me, but I have questions I need you to address.""

Specifically, I needed to know if he'd paid his estimates.

He responds: ""I expected my accountant to help me with estimates, but since you didn't, I didn't pay them.""

The date is April 12th and I am at a negative patience level.

""I prepared estimates with the return I filed last year, with instructions on how much, when, and how to pay. I also sent out a quarterly newsletter to my clients with reminders to pay estimates by which day.""

""Oh I didn't open any of your emails because I thought it was boring tax stuff."" (I'm not even kidding about this)

I immediately sent a disengagement letter, let him know he could plug in his net income to TurboTax to figure out how much he owed, and to find someone else.",2024-05-09T19:05:50+00:00

So it was between two business partners one was the one getting audit for some fraud. The other one was trying to figure out why money was missing but could not track it down. So my uncle gets a call from the courts to work on a case. He did some investigation into it. The one who was doing the fraud called my uncle not knowing he is an auditor working on his case. The client came clean and openly told my uncle. He took the $6 million that was missing. My uncles best friend is an attorney so my uncles forwards everything over. Now my uncle knows who to look for. He asked the courts for promises to get bank records. So my uncle got them. The guy claimed he only took $6 million my uncles found about $33 million. He then went along and did some more digging. Well a few years before this he was a licensed accountant. The business partner he was investigating. He had a similar case but he took about $89 million from clients over a 3 year period. He ended up in jail. And still is.,2024-05-09T19:53:17+00:00

Tax,comment,l3f0l99,jpop0623,,"Just this year, I had to fire a family member as a client. My wife’s cousin is always too impulsive and doesn’t tell me anything or ask me what he should do until after it happens and asks me to fix it. Nothing crazy, just a bit more creativity than I’m charging him for. He got divorced last year and didn’t ask me the best way to pay out his ex wife, so he had penalties and taxes that he didn’t need to have, but again, does things without asking, typical year for him. Filed his returns, everything is fine. 

About April 1st, he asks me if he can come in over that weekend for an appointment. I told him that unless it was an emergency, it would have to wait until after April 15th. He tells me it’s an emergency. He then tells me that he intentionally didn’t give me a tax form because he didn’t have the money to pay the taxes. But wait…there’s more…

The tax form he didn’t give me was a Form 1099-K for $58,000. Apparently him and his boss and one or two others decided to steal from their employer by selling the inventory with their own credit card account. And yes, my wife’s cousin decided to volunteer as owner of this new credit card. Oh even better, he told the credit card processor that he wanted to collect sales tax, but then didn’t remit it. And even better than that, I asked him what he was selling…alcohol. 

I told him that he couldn’t face broken any more laws if he tried. I told him that he’s completely toxic and that I cannot help him on this matter or any returns going forward. Especially since he told me he specifically held back information from me which makes my job more difficult. My wife was confused on how I can fire family and then she understood when I explained. He understood and went on his merry way. It’s only a matter of time before I find out he’s in jail for something, but at least I won’t be sharing a cell with him.",2024-05-10T11:29:48+00:00

Not sure if it’s just because she’s uneducated or ignorant — but it’s her stubbornness that made me let her go. Here’s a few examples:

1. She provided me with just one W2, so I asked if that was all. She replied dismissively, ""If I had more, I'd have included them."" Okay. I nodded and moved on. After calculating her refund, she questioned why it was so low. I explained it was based on her W2 withholdings. She insisted, ""You're missing the point, that's not everything — I made more income!"" and then proceeds to pull out two more W2’s. *FACEPALM

2. Another instance was when I wanted to confirm if her direct deposit is the same as last year’s. She said her bank info changed but provided me the same exact account # and routing #. I told her that her bank info is actually the same numbers. Tell me why she went off on me and yelled that it wasn’t the same thing. After arguing back and forth for a good 2 minutes, she pulls out her debit card and said “then explain why my card numbers are different, huh?! I lost my debit card and they issued me a new one. Why is that so hard to understand?” *DOUBLE FACEPALM

Oh there were definitely more stories from her that made me want to bash my head against the wall. But I’m just very glad she’s not my client anymore. Good luck to whoever is taking her on as their new client.",2024-05-11T08:54:54+00:00

My ""first"" 20 years as a volunteer preparer were with the Tax-Aide program administered by the AARP Foundation. While VITA should be fine, I believe that generally you'll get better training and more experienced colleagues in the Tax-Aide program. Tax-Aide also has excellent support documentation.

The clientele of the two programs differ more by the type of site than by differences in the programs. Both have nearly identical scope limitations and experienced counselors have very deep but not particularly broad knowledge. A big difference is that Tax-Aide is 95% in-person while the VITA program has both in-person and a substantial virtual presence (e.g. GetYourRefund). For maximum personal satisfaction you can't beat helping someone face-to-face.

All of us professionals deal with a certain amount of “bad” clients. It’s part of the deal and we’re used to it. However we all have different thresholds and tolerance for the levels of “bad” we’re willing to accept.

As a general rule though, a client like the one the OP mentions is going to constantly complain and it will never get better. They’ll be a time suck, demanding assistance with every menial aspect of tax and are usually unwilling to pay for those services. Some are, but most aren’t. Keep in mind, our engagements are generally limited to preparing a tax return. That does not include assistance in making payments or even reminding you to make payments when they are due. In the time it takes to respond to this guy’s emails and placate him you likely could have gotten more returns done for clients who are appreciative of the work we do. 

It’s a balancing act as to the opportunity cost in keeping a guy like this around vs servicing other clients that may pay better or be more enjoyable to work with. Guys like this are also a mental drain that create frustration which can bleed over into your interactions with other clients.

Fedposter

A fedposter is an imageboard or forum poster who is most likely a federal agent. Originating from 4chan's /pol/ board and associated communities, the term refers to a poster who openly calls for violence against others or encourages one to break the law in some manner.

The fed part of fedposting comes from the fact that these posts are either made by federal agents hoping to entrap someone into saying the same thing and getting visited by the feds for it, or by naive people saying the same things and ending up with visits from the feds.

Sorry in advance if I ask or say anything stupid, nor very good with these sorts of things.
I got a letter in the mail fom a group called ""keystone collections group"". The letter states I was notified about a ""delinquent earned income tax"" and failed to reconcile an account balance. First time im receiving any form of contact about this. Its saying its from my town school district and city. Its giving me a notice for intent to garnish my wages. 
Ive filed my taxes every single year on time and gotten a tax return, including this most recent cycle. This is the first time Ive been contacted about somehow owing taxes? Wouldnt I have not recieved a tax return if I somehow owed taxes? I recieved over 1k in my return this year and the letter is stating I owe a little over 1.5k?

* I was a 1099 contractor in 2022 and filed all my taxes through H&R Block, though it appears my tax expert filed them under a C-Corp rather than an S-Corp. Despite the discrepancy, I paid every dollar I was told I owed.

* I have since received mail from the IRS stating I did not pay any of my 2022 taxes, which I of course provided all the information to them in order to review and rectify.

* Since then, I received a notice they are in progress of looking through my taxes and that they'll be in touch within six months.

Here's a breakdown after the IRS follow-up:

* A few weeks ago, my previous employer asked for a retroactive W-9, as they received a CP2100A form (irs.gov/cp2100a).

* Looking at the CP2100A form they received, it said my information was incorrect, though after confirming both my TIN and name, it was an exact match.

* I asked for the previous W-9 they had on file in order for me to cross-reference what was incorrect - I was told they shredded it.

I could really use advice on whether this is standard business practice, or if it's a red flag. I really have no idea how to proceed or what financial implications this may have. Any assistance is very much appreciated.",2024-05-09T18:03:40+00:00

Long answer.  
Cost basis for primary residence
Purchase price $375k
Any costs of closing from purchase
Appraisal, survey, etc. 
any improvements
Any costs of sale including realtor fees. 

Sales price - cost of sales is profit or loss. 
No loss allowable for personal residence. 

No profit would be taxable if under $250k profit (single/$500k married) and you lived there at least 2 out of the last 5 years.

Exception to that rule is if job related relocation.  So then you would be able to exclude up to the percentage of number of months lived there/24 months times $250k exclusion.  Example 12 months over 24 months is 50% of $250k is $125k exclusion if single….double if married.

Tax,post,1co2twi,Swimbikerunwingfoil,Mortgage interest deduction to calculate net interest rate,"
Hi,

I am a real estate beginner based in California, and I’m looking at homes right now. The lender quoted me a 7.4% interest rate. 

My interest payments would be about $27,000/yr (averaged over 30 years) which is below the $29,200 MFJ standard deduction. No other deductions (charitable, etc…)

Thus, our taxable income goes from $240,000 --> $213,000, which keeps me in the 24% bracket MFJ.

Thus, i am not benefiting from deduction and my effective interest rate is still 7.4%. It would only benefit me if i was at the limit of two brackets, correct? 

Can somebody please confirm if i am understanding this properly? 

Thanks. ",2024-05-09T17:29:54+00:00

I run a small business I have 1099 income, this question is for my 2023 taxes - This is my first year adding to a 401k with my business even though its been going on for years

Turbo tax said I could contribute something around the ballpark of 23k into a 401k (reduce my tax liability too), I mistakenly opened a ""IRA"" and not a 401k........... I contributed 23k into an IRA instead of a 401k. On my tax return that has been submitted for 2023 it says I put it in my 401k even though currently it sits in a IRA.

I have now opened the proper 401k account (which it seems too late as 2023 is over) but if I do a roll over they tell me it wont count as a ""contribution"" and I already purchased stocks, so if I do a contribution they are telling me I need to sell the assets in the account, move it into a brokerage account and then do the contribution again (Which I believe would go towards my 2024 contribution NOT my 2023. Also there may be a penalty?

My question is what is my best route here? Thank you for your time.

Tax,comment,l3arho8,RasputinsAssassins,,"What was the net profit (the amount after allowable deductible expenses) on the LLC income? If it was $50,000. then you are looking at roughly 37% tax on that income (roughly 22% income tax and %15% self-employment tax, state not included), which is about $18,500.

Your total income of $130K would see an income tax of about $13,200. In addition, you would owe self-employment tax of about 15% on the LLC profit, which ends up being about $7,500 (there are other calculations, but for ease in understanding, use 15% of the profit). So your total bill is roughly $20,700.

The ages of the children and the amounts of the estimated payments will matter. Three children aged 17 or older is a credit of $1500; three children aged 16 or younger is a credit of $6000.

My guess is that the Box 2 withholdings shown on the W2s, plus the credits for the children, plus the estimated payments, was not enough to cover the total tax bill (particularly if you were working part-time).

My assumption is that if they revoke the s-corp and are stuck in the c-corp, there will be a taxable event when the corporation is dissolved, in order to get their assets in their name on their Sch E.

I'm leaning towards thinking the best thing to do would be to sell it in the s-corp and never do it again. I don't think doing a 1031 starting in the s-corp and ending with a new LLC would work, but that's why I'm here.

Thanks in advance for any help/insight!",2024-05-09T14:25:30+00:00

doing a 1031 only defers the income, when you take it out of the corp, that creates a taxing event.   so not even sure what the goal is for the 1031.  

Or just keep it in there as an scorp.    you'll have double taxation as a c-corp, so I'm not understanding the reasoning for revoking s-election.

Tax,post,1cnygmm,creakyt,Rollover to 401k and Roth from rollover IRA with both pre and post tax funds question,"From researching, it seems I can do this without tax consequences. As stated, I have a rollover IRA, with both pretax funds and a nondeductabile post-tax contribution from 2021 (form 8606 was filed that year). My plan is to first rollover the IRA balance minus the nondeductible contribution to a 401k, then transfer that remaining nondeductible amount to a Roth IRA. Two questions

1) With the first rollover of the pre-tax amount in the IRA to the 401k. How long do you then need to wait to then transfer the post-tax amount to a Roth? Does it matter that there might be a change to that post-tax balance during that time frame?

2) Is the transfer of the post-tax/nondeductible amount from the rollover IRA to a Roth IRA considered a back door contribution if you wouldn't qualify for a direct Roth contribution? i.e. or could I still do an additional backdoor contribution in the same year?

Tax,post,1cnxt0d,Immediate_Roof_6201,Capital Gains Exclusion during non-qualified official duty posting?,"Hello r/tax 

We are puzzling over whether and when the sale of our home could qualify for any capital gains exclusion and will certainly reach out to a qualified tax professional, but we'd like to see what you think as well. Facts and timeline are as follows:

Husband is a longtime employee of the United States Government currently on extended overseas duty, but not armed forces, foreign service, or intelligence community, or Peace Corps (or NOAA, etc).   
Before he was on overseas duty, we lived in the US. We purchased our house in late 2013 and lived there until mid-2021.  In mid-2021, he accepted a multiyear (but term-limited) posting that transferred the family overseas.  We moved in the summer of 2021. Technically, he was on a detail for the first several months of the post -- we had to go a few months early because of a medical issue I had.  His formal overseas assignment began in late 2021 (after my medical issue resolved). We still have drivers' licenses in our home state (and pay state taxes there) and always intended to return to the house at the end of the posting in a few years.  We are not subject to expatriate tax. We do not own or rent another home (we live in government quarters). The kids are in school overseas but are off for the summers.  For the last year or so, I've had a remote job in another US state.

Our house has been rented out in our absence: a couple days after we flew out, tenants moved in.  Their lease will end and they will move out right around the 3-year mark from the day we flew out (exact date TBD, could be a little before or a little after).

We would like to understand the tax implications of selling now but are stuck on the residence test in IRS Publication 523. Questions we have are: 1) I don't think we qualify for the suspension of the 2-out-of-5 years rule for being on qualified official extended duty, but does anyone see it differently? 2) Could any of our time away since 2021 count toward the two-year residence requirement -- in other words, when would be the deadline on the sale of the house if we could still benefit from the full exclusion? 3) Could these facts instead qualify us for the partial exclusion of gain? 4) We want to go home for the summer anyway; could there be any tax advantage to living in the house while it's vacant this summer?  Thanks in advance for any insights.",2024-05-09T13:51:57+00:00

Tax,comment,l3abg3l,PraxicalExperience,,"First off, don't panic.  The IRS doesn't want to go through the hassle of filing liens and levies if they can avoid it, and they're government employees doing their job -- they're not going to engage in scummy collection pressure-tactics to get you to pay, other than threatening (and then possibly applying) liens and levies.

You should have received 3-4 letters before you got the final notice, and more if you didn't file taxes and they decided to do a Substitute For Return for you.  But if you moved and they didn't have current information these could have been sent to a prior address.

That said, call the IRS, request a 120-day extension to pay.  You should get that automatically.  That buys you time to get your shit together.

Find out exactly what's going on with your account, where you owe, etc.  Get copies of any income documents that they've based assessments on if they did an SFR or if you got hit by AUR (automated underreporter -- when there's income reported that you didn't claim on your return,) or exam.  If you were assessed due to AUR, request a copy of the CP2000 notice.  Get account transcripts for any years you owe.  Then go and do your back taxes.  It might be wise to go to a professional, but you may be able to do these yourself.  Unless you filed an extension for your 2020 taxes you won't be able to get a refund from them, but you can still get refunds for '21 and '22 (which will go towards anything owed.)  

You can apply your gambling losses against your winnings -- you may be able to reconstruct these from bank records, but I'm sketchy on the kind of documentation that the IRS might accept as backup if they decide to ask for it.

If you still owe money, the IRS offers payment plans.  These are usually set up to have you pay off the full amount in 7 years, but if you can show financial hardship they can be less.  You may also qualify for 'currently not collectible' status, where they acknowledge you owe the money but can't pay, and they won't come after you for it -- other than seizing any refunds you're due.  Finally, you may be able to file an Offer in Compromise, where you agree to pay a chunk of the debt off for forgiveness of the rest -- though this is the hardest one to get, really.",2024-05-09T14:28:41+00:00

Line 3a has been modified to clarify how a disregarded entity completes this line. An LLC that is a disregarded entity should check the appropriate box for the tax classification of its owner. Otherwise, it should check the “LLC” box and enter its appropriate tax classification.  
New line 3b has been added to this form. A flow-through entity is required to complete this line to indicate that it has direct or indirect foreign partners, owners, or beneficiaries when it provides the Form W-9 to another flow-through entity in which it has an ownership interest.

I know and getting the 3000 a year exclusion on them yearly. Also I have a house which has been my primary residence since 2021 when I bought the house and has appreciated by like 400k. 

Questions.

1. I know since I fall into the 2/5 year residence rule of primary house I am exempt from 500k gains as married filing jointly on capital tax.  So correct me if I sell this, I don’t pay any capital gains. But do they offset my losses and reduce my carry forward losses

2. If I don’t sell the house now and rent it out and let’s say in 5-6 years it appreciates by 600k or so- and I’m not going to be primary residence owner do my stock market losses offset the gains or do I pay taxes on all 600k gains or just 100k gains (over 500k)

Tax,post,1cnn1p9,Worried_Scheme_2171,The Mississippi Treasury promised my dad tax benefits… now he is being taxed on qualified expenses,"I am a college student in Mississippi whose parents started a Mississippi Affordable College Savings (MACS) account when I was young. One of the promises of the plan is that any income put into the account is tax exempt and any qualified expenses (tuition, books, room & meal plan, college-related etc) made by withdrawing from the account won’t be taxed. However, unqualified expenses (money withdrawn and not spent towards college) will be taxed. 

I have access to the MACS account to request withdrawals, and my parents are fine with letting me handle this on my own.

All of the times I have withdrawn money from my MACS account, they have gone directly from the MS treasury to my university. Every withdrawal I have made has been a qualified expense (all tuition and books payments.) I am still my dad’s tax dependent and my dad covers my tax payments for me whenever my employer doesn’t withhold enough. (I am very grateful to him)

In the 2022 tax year, the documents sent from my university and the documents sent from the MS treasury did not line up well. I had withdrawn money in December of 2022 to pay tuition (qualified expense) for the Spring 2023 semester. However, my university did not process the payment until January 2023. So, on my tax documents, the treasury reported a withdrawal that my university’s documents did not report, and therefore I could not prove the withdrawal was a qualified expense with those documents. My dad and I tried to reach out to both my university and the treasury for help, but both institutions threw up their hands and said there was nothing they could do. We sucked it up and paid taxes on the qualified expense. We figured the issue had come about from withdrawing too late in the year, so I resolved to wait until January to make withdrawals to pay for the Spring.

Mind you, it is very difficult to wait until January to pay for the Spring semester. For Spring 2024, I withdrew as soon as I was able to (January 2nd.) The university expects full payment on the first day of class, so there is (and was not) enough time for the withdrawal to be processed before the money is due. I had to sign up for a tuition payment plan and still pay about $450 out of pocket so that I could wait for the MACS withdrawal to process. Once it processed, I did get the $450 refunded. 

Now, for whatever reason, the MS Treasury has also reported the withdrawal made on January 2nd 2024 on my 2023 tax document. Obviously, the university document does not include that at all, so once again I am unable to prove that it was a qualified expense. 

I don’t want to keep being taxed on qualified expenses. I don’t think I should have to dance around the December/January tax year divide for the next two years I need to pay tuition for Spring. Honestly, I think my dad should be reimbursed for the taxes he paid last year on the qualified expense that shouldn’t have been taxed. I also have a younger brother who paid $15,000 in tuition this year for his spring semester, and my dad is stressing that we might be taxed on that next year (for perspective my payments have been <$2k.) I don’t want my dad to keep being taxed on what was promised by the Mississippi treasury to be tax exempt. How can I show that every withdrawal has been qualified and get my dad’s tax exemptions?

I filed my taxes online through turbotax cause I had a good experience using them last year.  I've been waiting a while for my tax return to hit my account and it never did, so I double checked if everything was correct.  I found out that the account and routing numbers were completely changed from what I initially put in.  I don't mean like one or two mistakes, the entire routing and account numbers were completely different like it was an entirely different account.  I have no idea what happened and I know for a fact that I didn't put those numbers in because I compared it to my 2022 taxes and they had the correct numbers.  Did someone change my numbers after or was there a complete mixup?  I was planning on calling turbotax tomorrow as they aren't open at the moment to try and figure out whats going on.  Is there anything specifically I should mention to them or should I go about it a completely different way.  Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you in advance.

Update: Found out the company the routing and account numbers are tied to is MVB Banking(never heard of it) and I use wells fargo

Tax,post,1cnmebq,patriotAg,SEP IRA for Spouse?  Can I just put money in my spouse's IRA?,"This may sound sloppy so I apologize.  My spouse and I share everything.  Joint accounts. Joint finances. 10000% community property.   All our vehicles, stuff, etc., we consider both of ours.   Even my shoes I consider half my spouses (just to give you the picture).

So we both work in a business.  I set it up to be a sole proprietership in my name years back.  WE BOTH WORK THE BUSINESS.    My spouse does a lot of the phone stuff, email, etc.

When we file taxes (joint return) since I pretty much handle all the checks, I just deposit them into my business account -> which means when we file taxes I just claim the income as mine, and the taxes are paid.  But as far as the IRS sees it, I'm the one making the $.   Again my spouse helps in the business, but does not report an income, but its both of ours (business) and my spouse and I just simply use the money as it comes together.   All income taxes paid of course.   We never exactly said my spouse is an employee, but my spouse certainly works the business.

I see that I can have a SEP IRA.  Can my spouse get one too and we just put money into it?  We'd max out both if possible.

EDIT: I don't really know how much I make, I don't know how much my spouse makes, but I know how much we make together.  That gets reported under my name for simplicity.  All taxes paid as joint filed.",2024-05-09T02:25:37+00:00

Tax,comment,l3cu75a,SeaworthyGlad,,"Your wording on this is a little odd. I get it, you jointly run a business and file one Schedule C.. That's not that uncommon.

Since your finances are combined, I don't see much benefit in funding her SEP. The only point would be to get funds in ""her name"" which you've already said is not relevant.

I think with $150K Schedule C you can fund your SEP w/ \~$30K. 

If you split you Schedule C so that she showed $75K profit and you showed $75K of profit then you'd each fund $15K, no real benefit to that - it's the same total SEP deduction.

On SSA / Medicare Tax, since you're not over the FICA limit I don't think splitting into two Schedule C would increase your SE Tax costs.

If you're able to save a lot, then you could consider each filing a Schedule C with $75K of profit and each forming your own solo 401k. If you're under 50 you could each defer up to $23K. So $46K total is better than $30K SEP. On top of that you could still each do a Profit Sharing Contribution of $15K. So in theory you could get $76K into deferral.

Tax,post,1cnlqwc,haramworld,IRS Penalty notification sent a year after the fact?,"Edit: I think this post is mostly resolved. Please forgive my ignorance and misunderstanding. Thank you to all who help clarify everything to me!

I just received a notification from the IRS saying I've been charges a penalty for failing to pay the estimated taxes. First time this has happened since I've been filing my taxes. I have 3 questions which I would like some help answering.

1- The 3rd page of the notification has a breakdown of random date intervals from Tax Day '23 till last week. Intervals like 61,15,77,15 days etc etc. Along each date interval there is a penalty amount listed with some data (principal, rate, factor).  If they were able to figure out that I had underpaid by mistake, why am I just now getting the notification? Did they intentionally wait a year just to penalize me as much as possible for the full year?

2-Related to number 1- I'm now nervous for 2024's taxes because I used the same service as 2023, and not much had changed as far as filing between the two years. Is there a way to check/get notified early if I underpaid as not to incur a higher penalty?

2- If I decide to pay the penalty amount (I'll be contesting the penalty with the service I used to file my taxes first), will that be the end of the 2023 story? IE I pay the penalty and then I won't get penalized again for 2023? Or will I have to dig through my forms and find out exactly what was underpaid and also pay that amount? Because they didn't tell me what the mistaken amount was so that's gonna be pretty fucking shitty.

(3) of these clients had been suffering post-pandemic and coincidently closed their own businesses last year. The revenue from my (1) remaining client was about 20% of my total revenue and to make ends meet, I had to start a W2 job and am working full time under that. Consequently, I have not been on my S-Corp payroll since 2Q2023.

Tax,post,1cnheql,supernerd1111,Discovery Letter of Inquiry - Michigan,"Got a letter from the Michigan Department of Treasury asking to provide more tax documents to them. I paid the amount of taxes needed though 2023 was by far the most complicated year for me. Not only did I have the standard W2 though I also switched states, had eight 1099s, sold and bought a house, and had a large amount of stock and crypto transactions. The most difficult part was the crypto side which has over 20,000 transactions.

From the letter it looks like I have the option to not respond and to have them take what they have already to review. I would prefer to go that route to avoid them asking questions on every transaction, though I don't want not responding to cause additional issues. To be clear, everything is legit and I'm not trying to avoid or hide anything, I just don't want to deal with this more than I have to.

How bad of an idea is it to not respond to this and let them compute what's needed via what they've already received from filing? I assume they just get a summary of what the IRS gets.

Thank you

  
Why You Are Receiving This Letter  
You received this letter because your State of Michigan 2023 Michigan Individual Income Tax Return (MI-1040 or MI-1040CR) was selected for review and more information is needed. The selection of your return does not mean that your return is incorrect or that your identity has been stolen. You may receive your refund as filed or if there are errors, they will be fixed, and you will be notified. Reviewing returns ensures taxpayers receive the correct refund. If you did not file a Michigan return or credit claim, please read the back of this letter for further instructions.   
  
What we need to complete the review   
• One copy of all original W-2(s) and/or form 1099(s).   
• Federal Income Tax Return and supporting schedules. If you filed a Federal Schedule C, C-EZ, E, or F, include the full address where the business activity is performed.   
  
What Happens Next   
After we receive the information, your paperwork will be reviewed in the order it is received. Once we receive your response you should get an explanation of adjustment, a request for more information, or your refund. If No Response Is Received Please respond within 30 days from the date of this letter. If you do not respond your tax return will be processed with no refund issued or you may have additional tax due. If your return is adjusted, a notice will be sent telling you how you can appeal that decision.",2024-05-08T22:28:47+00:00
Tax,comment,l3acvld,fitzpats9980,,"It sounds like they will eliminate the refund, and possibly make further adjustments to your return. It doesn't sound like they are worried about the Crypto transactions since they are only asking for the W2 and 1099 forms, along with the Schedule C which is tied to the 1099 information. 

Now, worst case scenario is they include all 1099 income as gross income to adjust your Federal AGI up as their starting point. That means a lot more Michigan income which could be taxed. Additionally, if they really wanted to, they could disallow any stated cost basis of the Schedule D transactions and report all of your trades as income and tax without a cost basis resulting in much more tax. Finally, the state will share their findings with the IRS. That means if they adjust the federal AGI based on the 1099 information not verified, the IRS will be notified that Michigan has increased the AGI and that would probably trigger a full review from the IRS which could be worse than what Michigan is doing to you. 

Personally, I think it's in your best interest to send them the information that they are requesting, and nothing more. If they need more, they will ask for more.",2024-05-09T14:37:20+00:00
Tax,comment,l3b5kpg,supernerd1111,,"Cost basis for the crypto stuff was near $0 as the $2400 initial investment turned into significantly more. So not too worried about that side.

The 1099s are mostly smaller like credit union interest, Treasury Bills, Fidelity stuff, and similar.. nothing really of significance.

The refund was also under $1000 though being so complicated of a year I ended up having to amend to add additional transactions. The amended return resulted in paying MI about $1000 more and Fed something like $7k more. There's also a lot of estimated taxes added into the mix which affects the numbers.

Didn't realize they didn't want the full TX list. That makes me feel a bit better. Will send the stuff over.

You'd just have to either email that file in, if possible, or print it and mail it in.

The funds to purchase the property came from our family business which the three of us own equally. We want to sell the property.

How can we sell it while minimizing tax liability? My understanding is that if we sell it then technically my dad would get 100% of the money. He would pay taxes on 100% the gains. Then if he gives my brother and me our shares of the proceeds, we would get taxed again as if it’s a gift.

Would we be able to tell escrow to wire the money directly to me, my brother, and my dad equally? Then we each pay taxes on our share of the gains. Is this possible even though only my dad’s name is on the title?",2024-05-08T21:57:49+00:00

Depending on the use of the property, that will help determine what tax would be paid. If there’s a building on the property that’s been depreciated, there will be some ordinary gain recognized (up to the amount of depreciation taken), with a max rate of 37%. This does not mean a flat 37% of the gain is taxed; remember, we have a progressive tax system. Ordinary rates are higher than capital gains rates, which the rest of the gain would be taxed at. Max capital gains rate is 20% (23.8% if the taxpayer is subject to NIIT). Gift taxes only affect the giftor, not the donee. Taxes are only owed on gifts once the lifetime exclusion has been used up, and that’s $13.6MM for 2024. 

Super simple example:

Original purchase price: $1,000,000
Depreciation Taken: $200,000
Sales Price:$1,200,000
Assumptions: 
-Marginal tax rate of 37%, capital gain rate of 20%, and subject to NIIT 


So to calculate gain, we need to first figure out what the total gain is: 

Proceeds: $1,200,000
Adjusted Basis $800,000 (million less 200k) 
Gain: $400,000 

Now we need to figure out the characteristics of that gain. Since we know depreciation taken totaled $200,000, we know that’s going to be our ordinary gain. From there, we would subtract that from the total gain and figure out the capital portion (also $200,000).

Now for the math:

$200,000 x 0.37 = $74,000
$200,000 x 0.238 = $47,600 

Total Taxes Owed = $121,600

Cash Flows: 
Proceeds: $1,200,000
Taxes Paid: (121,600)

She would never pay taxes on the entire amount because it is a Roth IRA and the decedent already paid taxes on the funds that flowed into the Roth IRA.

>

That is correct, only the earnings will be taxed -if- the decedent had no other Roth IRA that met the 5-year rule. If the decedent truly opened the Roth IRA only 2 years ago, the beneficiary will owe taxes on the gains (only).

[https://greenleaftrust.com/missives/the-two-roth-5-year-rules/](https://greenleaftrust.com/missives/the-two-roth-5-year-rules/)

***Qualified Roth Distributions:*** Before we get to the two separate Roth 5-year rules that need to be satisfied before taking a distribution, what follows is a short ‘refresher’ of what constitutes a *qualified Roth distribution.* 

If the distribution from a Roth IRA is *qualified,* the entire distribution, including its earnings, is tax-free. However, to be a classified as a *qualified* distribution: 

(i) the Roth IRA owner must be over the age 59 ½, or the distribution must be for the Roth owner’s disability, or for the Roth owner’s purchase of a new home, **or it must be to a beneficiary who has inherited the Roth IRA from its owner**; 

-***and-*** 

(ii) **the Roth IRA owner must have held** ***a*** **Roth IRA for a period of at least 5 years.** This last 5-year Roth holding period condition applies of any of the owner’s Roth IRAs, starting with his/her first contribution to *a*ny Roth IRA, or a conversion of a traditional IRA to *any* Roth IRA held by its owner.

  
-Perhaps your comment isn't exact, but beneficiary spouses have two different actions to consider. S/He can retain the Inherited Roth IRA as-is, or they can perform a Spousal Rollover and acquire ownership of the decedent's Roth IRA. If the surviving spouse had his/her own Roth IRA for 5-years -and- performed a spousal rollover before cashing out the inherited Roth IRA then the 5-year rule would have been met.

**Surviving Spouses:** If a spouse is named as the beneficiary of an *inherited*  Roth IRA, he/she must also wait the 5-year holding period in order to receive a *qualified* distribution from the Roth IRA. **Yet, if the surviving spouse does a spousal** ***rollover*** **he/she will be permitted to use the more beneficial 5-year holding period on the inherited Roth IRA from their spouse, or the 5-year holding period if they have their own Roth IRA.**",2024-05-09T15:16:01+00:00

Tax,post,1cnf6u9,aureliosisto,Looking for direction on different ways to amend 2023 taxes already filed,"Hi all...    

Just like the subject states - my wife and I had our 2023 taxes filed (electronically) a few weeks ago with our accountant. 

We ended up owing a substantial amount, and felt this was off. So, for giggles, I used TurboTax (our taxes are fairly simple. Besides our W2's, there's a couple of accounts that bare interest and that's pretty much it) and found we were able to reduce what was owed by *$3500 less.*

Obviously I reached out to him, sending a copy of the return he filed (Fed and NYS) along with a copy of what TurboTax produced. He has been unresponsive at times, emailing back nonsense like ""what am I looking at"" and has now gone dark for the past week (all this was over 3 1/2 weeks). Part of this was Passover, so he gets a pass there, but c'mon - if I treated my clients like this, I would be out of a job right quick.

So here's my question - am I locked in with HIM to handle/file an amendment? I am presuming someone else can do this (I would think I could take a stab at this, but would prefer a pro to handle this to ensure no mistakes), but wanted to confirm this. 

Really appreciate any/all help!

Tax wise, it worth it to have them pay to my S corp if the state I will be working in has no income tax (WA), or would it be better to be paid directly? Thank you!",2024-05-08T20:01:57+00:00
Tax,comment,l371f6k,LaPetiteChien,,"What a strange, stupid, and potentially fraudulent situation to be in.

Short answer: The benefits of income from an S-corp vs being paid directly are the same regardless of whether the state you live in has an income tax or not. Or rather, the tax benefit of moving to a state with no income tax is the same regardless of whether the income is from an S-corp or not.

Long answer: The reason people go from a Sole Proprietorship to an S-Corporation is because the net income that passes through from an S-Corporation is not subject to self-employment taxes (Self-employment taxes are a Federal tax and ~15.3%). Pass-through income from an S-Corp and net income from a Sole Prop are both still subject to ordinary income taxes (a Federal marginal progressive tax, between 10% and 37%).

However, there are a few caveats that diminish this benefit. For starters, a sole proprietorship can subtract 1/2 of the Self-Employment income tax from their business's net income for ordinary income tax. 

So, hypothetically, a Sole Prop with $100,000 of net income would pay 15.3% of that net income in SE tax ($15,300) but only pay ordinary income tax on $92,350 of income. If that Sole Prop became an S-corp then the individual would pay ordinary income tax on the entire $100,000.

Additionally, S-corporations are beholden to what's call a ""reasonable compensation"" requirement for their owners. This means that the S-Corp needs to pay it's owners as if they were an employee, and that amount must be ""reasonable"". This re-introduces the SE tax to the S-Corp.

So, in the same example, the Sole Prop with $100,000 in net income becomes an S-corp but now the owner needs to pay themselves as an employee. If the ""reasonable compensation"" for the owner is $80,000, then they must pay Employment Taxes (which are effectively the same as Self-Employment taxes) on the $80,000. The S-Corp can still deduct the 1/2 of the  SE tax. So now it looks like:


- Net-Income before owner's pay: $100,000

- Owner's pay: $80,000

- Employment taxes paid: $12,240

- Deductible 1/2 of Employment taxes: $6,120

- S-Corp's final net income: $13,880

- The owner's tax return will have $93,880 ($80,000 + $13,880) in ordinary income.


As you can see, the main benefit of the S-Corp is that you pay less S/E tax. The benefit is better the higher the business's net income is. Ordinary income tax isn't really effected by this kind of set-up.

For State issues: Oregon doesn't have an SE tax. They only have the one ordinary income tax rate, it's usually somewhere between 5% and 9%. Because the S-Corp vs Sole Prop designation doesn't affect ordinary income much, there isn't a benefit on the State's side to picking one over the other.

If it's ""worth it"" to make your business an S-Corp for Federal taxes, then it will also be ""worth it"" on the State's side. If you move to a State with no income tax, then the benefit is the same regardless of the source of the income.

The bigger issue here is that you are not in charge of whether the income goes to you (the individual) or the S-Corp. If the company pays the S-Corp, then it's the S-Corp's income. If they pay you (the individual) then it's your income. It's not your decision, it's up to whoever is paying you.

Are you an employee? It sounds like you're an employee? Are you getting a paycheck with taxes already withheld from it? If you are, then please don't try to declare that as the S-Corp's income. That is conceptually wrong and likely net detrimental from a tax perspective.",2024-05-08T21:57:01+00:00

Your answer is predicated on OP only having a single job which isn't the case. Since they have a W-2 job where their wages are near the SS wage base, an S-Corp really doesn't make sense. 

That said, I am going to address the other comments in your reply so others aren't misinformed. My answers based on the situation where there is no other wage income, which was your assumption.

>Short answer: The benefits of income from an S-corp vs being paid directly are the same regardless of whether the state you live in has an income tax or not. Or rather, the tax benefit of moving to a state with no income tax is the same regardless of whether the income is from an S-corp or not.

Not necessarily. Some states have Pass-Thru Entity Taxation which allows an S-Corp to pay state tax at an entity level on S-Corp profit which would effectively allow an individual to get a deduction for those state taxes paid without having to itemize on their federal return.

This isn't the benefit you think it is. While a sole-proprietor can subtract 1/2 of SE tax, the 1/2 of FICA tax is also effectively subtracted from the S-Corp's net profit before it's passed to the shareholder.

>So, hypothetically, a Sole Prop with $100,000 of net income would pay 15.3% of that net income in SE tax ($15,300) but only pay ordinary income tax on $92,350 of income. If that Sole Prop became an S-corp then the individual would pay ordinary income tax on the entire $100,000.

Not really-- your logic/math is off. For one, see my previous comment. Basically, if the the S-Corp only had $100k, the 7.65% for employer FICA would need to be subtracted from that before the wages could be paid. So, the employee could earn $92894 which would allow for $7106 (7.65%) in employer FICA tax. The employee would pay tax on $92,894.

As a sole-prop. The SE tax would be $14130 (15.3% of 92.35% of $100k). With the adjustment for 1/2 SE tax, the taxpayer would pay income tax on $92,935.

>Additionally, S-corporations are beholden to what's call a ""reasonable compensation"" requirement for their owners. This means that the S-Corp needs to pay it's owners as if they were an employee, and that amount must be ""reasonable"". This re-introduces the SE tax to the S-Corp.

This \^\^\^ is absolutely true. The info at [this IRS link](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporation-compensation-and-medical-insurance-issues#Fewer%20Than%20Two%20Participants%20Who%20Are%20Current%20Employees%20Exception:~:text=group%20health%20plans-,Reasonable%20Compensation,-S%20corporations%20must) addresses how reasonable compensation should be set for S-Corp shareholders. A lot of service-based S-Corps do NOT set reasonable compensation correctly.

>  
>  
>As you can see, the main benefit of the S-Corp is that you pay less S/E tax. The benefit is better the higher the business's net income is. Ordinary income tax isn't really effected by this kind of set-up.

This last sentence is also not accurate. There's a QBI deduction of 20% of: 

* For an S-Corp: 20% of net profit - SE health insurance deduction
* For a sole-prop: 20% of net profit - 1/2 SE tax - SE health insurance deduction - SE retirement plan contributions.

IF the person is eligible. (Note, it's also limited to 20% of taxable income before the QBI deduction is taken into consideration.) 

Since an S-Corp's profit doesn't include the reasonable compensation and the net SE income is basically all of the net profit of the sole-prop, the sole-proprietor will typically pay less ordinary income tax (once again assuming they're eligible for the QBI deduction).

No. When you have an S-Corp, there's absolutely no reassessment of the amount subject to SS on Schedule C.

You missed my point here. Yes, they will be able to get the EE part of the excess SS tax applied as a credit on their 1040, but the half that the employER had to pay is gone. Each employer pays SS tax on wages they pay up the SS wage base for each employee, independent of any other wages that employee may have. The ER part is gone.

Tax,post,1cnb6mw,thecelloman,I think I need a W2C to file a 2021 Oregon state amendment - my employer thinks otherwise,"Hi,

I was hired by my current employer in May of 2021. I was living in Nevada and classified as a fully remote worker but I reported to our Portland office. In November of 2021, I moved to Oregon and have lived here since. However, my employer had classified me as an Oregon employee from the first day I was hired, meaning that I paid Oregon state income tax from May-Nov that I shouldn't have. This information is reflected on my paystubs and my W2. I did not catch this until after I had already filed my 2021 tax return. I believe I'm owed ~$1200 from the state of Oregon but I'm unsure how to process that refund.

I am under the impression that the correct path forward is to file an amendment to my Oregon state 2021 tax return using a W2C reflecting the appropriate amount of Oregon state tax. My employer said they would not issue a W2C because their Oracle records indicate that I worked in Oregon from my hire date. They are telling me that the correct procedure is to get a letter from my manager saying that I did in fact work remote and then file that letter with the state who will then issue me a refund. Shockingly, I cannot find a tax form that is specifically angled at managers promising that their employees overpayed tax, so I have no idea how I would file such a letter.

I have spoken to my manager he is willing to write that letter if needed (I have chat history already confirming my move date.) I just need to know the correct way to proceed. I know the real answer is to hire a tax professional, but when I tried previously the guy I found was super unhelpful in general and wanted $500 to fix this, which doesn't seem worth it I'm only owed $1200. He did seem to think that an amended return was the correct path forward, though.

Tax,comment,l36e670,Aggravating-Walk1495,,"File an amended return reallocating the Oregon-source income.

The W2 is correct. It properly states the amount of tax that your employer remitted to Oregon. It's not the employer's job to get it back. It's yours.

It's now up to you to file an amended return to Oregon. During the process of amending your return, in the Oregon portion, you should be able to indicate that you were a part year resident, and go through the process of allocating the correct amount to Oregon for tax purposes. Your tax liability would then be corrected, and you'd then claim a refund for the difference.

Tax,comment,l361ka3,ABeajolais,,"You already tried this on your own. You've ended up with years of unfiled taxes and a huge tax liability. You're still worried about paying a pro to take care of it for you.

I've never understood why people don't blink an eye to take their car to a professional mechanic once every year or so and pay a service fee of a few hundred bucks, but something so important as taxes for some reason lots of people believe it's easy and all they need is a cheap computer program. This is a good example of why that's not a good mindset.

These are my opinions on tax professionals. CPAs who are tax specialists are at the top of the heap in terms of depth of knowledge and experience. They're also at the top of the heap in terms of cost. To be honest, most of the CPAs I know do a lot more business entity returns, partnerships, corporations, LLCs, etc., and it can be overkill for individual tax returns.

I recommend staying away from the big box places in strip malls with household names. They're usually at the top cost-wise, but the knowledge and experience is wildly inconsistent. You can have a 25-year veteran in one desk, and an absolute beginner one desk over. It's a crap shoot which one you'll get to prepare your returns. It takes a matter of years for someone to learn enough and gain enough experience to be competent in preparing tax returns.

Enrolled Agents (EAs) are usually a good bet for individual returns. An EA has either passed a comprehensive IRS exam, or worked for the IRS in tax analysis for a number of years. EAs are strictly taxes, which means they usually keep updated on all the tax law changes during the year. As compared with CPAs, an EA is going to be much more competent than a CPA who only does taxes during the season or on the side. EAs tend to be in the middle price wise.

Unenrolled preparers can be good if they've been in the business a while. Family business that have been around a long time are usually the best, with good pricing and a lot of experience keeping a good reputation with the locals.

I recommend asking everybody you know who their tax pro is. Call several people. Half of being a good tax preparer is communication in my opinion. You'll get a good feel for the people at the offices you call and how well they communicate with you.

One issue everybody's dealing with is a shortage of preparers. The old guard is retiring, and there are not many young people coming in to fill the void. That not only means it may be difficult to find someone who has openings, but prices are going up fast as massive overall inflation and a preparer shortage create the perfect storm.",2024-05-08T18:33:10+00:00

If you are being hired as a caterer for an event and someone says that a person there has a peanut allergy so you can't use anything with peanuts, they are simply specifying the parameters of the job that they are paying to have done, the caterer did not suddenly become an employee due to a peanut allergy request.

When they say ""what will be done and how it will be done"" that \*generally\* refers to work assignments. If they tell you that you have to take 50 calls per day, that is just outlining the work. But if they tell you that you have to take the calls and you were hoping to ride your bike that day, you are an employee if they are forcing you to do the work on their schedule.

""How it will be done"" is often misleading because a work product can have requirements.

Tax,post,1cn9ksg,__chrd__,Tax regarding a taxable brokerage account that’s meant as a gift,"Not sure if there’s a better way to go about this but in general I’d like to gift a taxable brokerage account in 10-15 years to someone. Could be sooner though if the recipient needs it. I want them to have access at all times just not pay taxes on gains and when they receive it (gift tax on my end).

 Sounds easy in theory but idk. I’ll talk to my lawyer and accountant but I’m on Reddit right now. 

It’s meant as a supplemental boost to their retirement funds but doesn’t really have to follow the age allocation approach and get more conservative with time. I plan to have it work very closely to one of my big growth accounts and if they need it during a downswing I’ll cover it from my side. 

I’m fully aware I can just gift the amount later down the line from my own account but I don’t want to give the view only access to that mostly because it would make others uncomfortable, not me. Also just a terrible idea in general. 

From my point of view the account is entirely theirs the whole time even if legally it’s mine or both of ours. Even in catastrophic loss or an accidental bitcoin purchase shooting it to the moon one day. I’ll be just fine. We’re family but not spouses.

Not sure how taxes play out if they’re an account owner like a joint account but never actually contribute or trade. I’d make them sole owner and get added like an advisor myself but that’ll screw up their taxes. 

There will be a massive gift tax for me of course when I lump sum or they can withdraw as needed too. No problem either way.

One way to do that is, just before you gift them the account, is **sell everything yourself**, incur the gains **yourself**, and repurchase everything fresh.  (Make sure there aren't any losses, though.)

Think about that, and make sure it's really what you want to do.  

Also give some thought to gifting them a fixed amount every year, rather than all at once.

> There will be a massive gift tax for me of course when I lump sum

Tax,comment,l36x3ti,belgarth,,"As mentioned in another comment thread, there is no gift tax unless you have been gifting in the millions (lifetime gift/estate lifetime exclusion limit). So the only real concern here is capital gains tax.

There are 3 possible options:

1) gift now. Cost basis is current basis. Recipient pays capital gains when they eventually sell on whatever growth there is from now to then. 

2) gift stock in 15 years. Cost basis is your basis when you buy it. Recipient pays capital gains on growth between now and then. 

3) sell before gifting and either gift the same proceeds or rebuy and gift stock. Cost basis will be FMV at the future date, so no gains to pay tax on

From the perspective of minimizing capital gains tax, it will basically come down to which capital gains bracket you will be in 15 years when you sell vs what the recipient will be in when he sells. 

My opinion: just gift it now. Assuming you wanted to pay the capital gains in 15 years, then also go ahead and also gift that money as well. Then it is up to the recipient to figure out how they want to handle it. They can do gain harvesting over time to minimize the potential tax. 

One alternative potential option is if you are significantly older than the recipient, then instead just will it to the recipient. Then when they inherit it, they will get the stepped up basis

The other alternative I know of is a non revocable trust, but the details of that are beyond me and I imagine wouldn’t be worth it for  125k (but might be for 750k)",2024-05-08T21:31:23+00:00

> which capital gains bracket …

Likely the highest. It can very I guess but it’s not getting any easier not to be. 

> My opinion: just gift it now… 

Yeah, I went back and forth thinking about this. They don’t exactly need it now and the benefit really only shines in retirement for them or to maybe allow retirement to happen a tad early. I also don’t want to necessarily gift now on the chance it becomes a lot bigger than I expect for whatever reason, then I want to allow for that possibility. And if it doesn’t then I have that minimum amount set regardless for then or anytime before. I just know they don’t and the $125k is working more efficiently with me in the meantime.

Tax,comment,l35mp5g,LaPetiteChien,,"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/heres-how-to-tell-the-difference-between-a-hobby-and-a-business-for-tax-purposes

If the activity is a for-profit business then you will need to file a Schedule C with your tax return. This will show all income/profit from the activity.

General advice: get a separate bank account under the business's name, all income and expenses should go through this account (no business transactions on the personal account, no personal transactions on the business account). Also, keep all your records for a minimum of 3 years after filing the return.

Registering as an LLC won't do much for tax purposes (although you can deduct the registration fees).

S&U tax can get complicated but the nexus rules tend to have a pretty high threshold (most states won't collect sales tax from an out-of-state business until $100,000 in local sales). Your home state will have different rules.

Another paycheck hit is your Federal and State taxes. These withholdings are to offset your eventual Income Taxes.

Your taxable income may be reduced by business losses, yes. This will reduce your Income Taxes when you file at the end of the year. It will not have an effect on your Employment taxes each pay period.

Include all the income and expenses from your Business on Schedule C.

 First I would look at the rules of statutory construction provided by the US Supreme Court. These explain how they analyze, interpret, and apply statutes. Then I would find a course on legal writing, specifically the IRAC writing format (Udemy is the one we used). Then I would find a good guide on briefing cases. I can't remember where I grabbed one from. I would find something that helps you understand how legislation is passed and the relationship between laws and regulations. And then finally something that helps you understand the levels of authority. 

These are all the basic tools for beginning to understand how laws are made, applied, and then written about. 

From there I would start briefing cases. If you can find someone to discuss these briefs even better but at a bare minimum the exercise will help you start to understand what courts are doing and how they get to the results they do. I could prove the cases I have assigned to my employee, but a couple of them are rough if you don't have someone to talk through them with.

Next, assumptions. These are the factual basis for your memo. If there is a requirement for the position you are analyzing, it goes here. For instance, if you are writing a memo on the portfolio interest exemption, you could include an assumption that the recipient of the interest is not a bank or a controlled foreign corporation, that kind of thing. 

Issues: succinctly list the issues to be analyzed. 

Executive Summary, succinctly list the memo's conclusions.

Finally, detailed analysis. I usually start with a summary of the relevant law, then apply to the facts to reach the conclusion outlined in the executive summary. Use footnotes for references to cases, IRC, Regs, Rev Ruls, etc. Take a look at the Bluebook if you want to follow legal citation practice. 

Once you've written a few, it comes more naturally and you also have old memos you can use to get started and copy the law, etc.

for some background I worked in PA last year (2023) and just moved back home with my parents. I did not file any MD taxes in 2023 as for the entirety of 2023 I did not live in MD. I also did not have to owe PA any money. 

  
MW507 asks me to claim exemptions. 

  
-""Claim exemption from withholding because I do not expect to owe Maryland tax. See instructions above and check boxes that apply:

A: Last year I did not owe any Maryland income tax and had a right to a full refund of all income tax withheld and 

b. This year I do not expect to owe any Maryland income tax and expect to have the right to a full refund of all income tax withheld. (This includes seasonal and student employees whose annual income will be below the minimum filing requirements). If both a and b apply, enter year applicable""

  
does this mean I select A? or do I only select A if B is also selected? And does this count as 1 or 2 exemptions? (There is a part of the form asking me how many exemptions Im taking?)

Successful search....Secured a health-plan for the family costing half as much as I had already been paying for the employer-provided family coverage. I declined signing up for the employer insurance and my next paycheck reflected the change. 

Two weeks go by and I get paid again...I notice that **my paycheck is $200 short!!!**

Or is my employer doing something shady (which I wouldn't put past them, they have before in the past).  
I'm going to contact my Tax prep guy just in case and find out what he thinks. He helped me get things sorted when the employer was setting taxes incorrectly for me because they set me up according to their ""California"" tax rules instead of the state where I live.

* 4.5% of 2000 for FTF = $90
* 0.5% of 2000 for FTP = $10
* $11 in interest on the $2000",2024-05-08T12:01:29+00:00
Tax,comment,l34bv4s,rratsd65,,"Additionally, if you file more than 60 days late, the FTF penalty can increase dramatically:

*If your return was over 60 days late, the minimum failure-to-file penalty is the smaller of $485 (for tax returns required to be filed in 2024) or 100% of the tax required to be shown on the return.*

Tax,post,1cn0s7x,Lost_Accountant_3432,529 Question living in NYC tax implications,"Hi, 

We live in NYC and have 2 529 plans. One is NY plan and the other is with Schwab and out of state.   
my child is going to high school in nyc and I would like to use some of the 529 plan with schwab to cover the tuition.  I cant seem to get a straight answer on if I will be penalized. My understanding is it should be ok because its a withdrawal from out of state , but cant use the NY plan as NYC doesn’t allow for 529 to be used for high school. Its all confusing so any help is much appreciated ",2024-05-08T09:58:43+00:00
Tax,comment,l3466xv,bobos-wear-bonobos,,"You're correct about not being able to make a qualified withdrawal from the NY Saves 529 to pay the tuition. That would definitely be subject to state and city taxes (both on the earnings portion, and on tax benefit recapture of the principal portion). There would not be any 10% penalty on the earnings, since that's only for withdrawals that are considered non-qualified at the Federal level, which this is not.


It's a good question about using the non-NY plan. At absolute worst, you would be subject to state and city taxes on the earnings portion of your withdrawal. There would be no recapture of any tax benefit on the principal, and no 10% penalty.


The question really boils down to whether state law dictates qualified/non-qualified use of non-state plans.


I'll try to find a more definitive answer.",2024-05-08T11:29:09+00:00

Tax,post,1cmy71w,100Sweets,Need clarification about US LLC taxation for non-residents.,"Hello, I'm planning to incorporate a single-member US LLC company as a non-US resident very soon. I will be selling web design & development services to US clients and most of my income will come from the US. I chose Wyoming as a state to incorporate a company.

While I was researching taxes for non-US residents, I stumbled upon the term \[Effectively connected income\](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/effectively-connected-income-eci#:\~:text=Generally%2C%20when%20a%20foreign%20person,Effectively%20Connected%20Income%20(ECI).).  Does that mean that I have to pay taxes if I'm selling my services to US clients?

Also, this \[article\](https://neubase.co/blog/us-llc-taxation-for-non-residents-all-you-need-to-know/) claims that as long as I don't live in the US, do not own any premises, and do not employ Americans full-time, then my effective tax rate can be brought down to 0%. However, I must file a tax return to the IRS to avoid paying penalties. Is this claim true? If not, what should I do instead?

Here is some context in my situation:

1. I reside in an African country and I have no physical presence in the US other than a US company. I set up a company mainly so that I can legally do business with US businesses as well as open a US bank account. (Plus, I like the perks of protecting my assets)
2. I do not live in the US and I do not own any premises there. I also do not employ Americans full-time, although I might hire US contractors on short-term projects.
3. Due to the nature of my business, all the work will be done remotely and I'm less likely to travel to the US.
4. I'm going to hire a registered agent in Wyoming to receive mail on my behalf, plus I need them to help open my business in the US anyway.",2024-05-08T06:51:37+00:00

Tax,post,1cmx15y,Suspicious-Spend5636,Deciding on moving to no state income tax state ,"Currently residing in CA, and planning to move to Texas mainly for two reasons 
1. Lower rental cost 
2. No state income tax 
Some context in my background 
- wife is moving to the States by June 2024 
- picked in H1B lottery so my move has to be atleast semi-permanent as H1B will kind of lock my locations for couple years 
- fully remote role but no revision in pay from this relocation 

Personal pros and cons of CA and Texas 
CA: I have friends here, weather is great, if wife plans to study in future eligible for resident fee as I have been in CA for 3 yrs now (the probability is very slim tho), good job opportunities for SE, however, very expensive rentals, higher tax, expensive everything 

Texas: Lower rentals, no state tax, average job opportunities for SE (assumption), however, don't know many people here, very hot weather, non resident fee for wife's studies 
Can someone help me decide or help me see the net different it would make. 
I am inclined to staying in CA if it does not make a whole bunch of difference considering everything. 
Appreciate all the help. 

Edit:
My current salary is 112K and I am thinking of shifting to Austin ",2024-05-08T05:34:03+00:00
Tax,comment,l35esxy,Hearst-86,,"Austin is home to the University of Texas (UT). It is the largest campus in the UT system. By Texas standards, Austin is a fairly liberal city, mostly because of the University campus/students, etc. Austin is not quite  Berkeley, but it does have a certain cosmopolitan flavor that you will not find in most of TX. The presence of UT is one of the reasons Austin is so attractive to the high tech business sector.

As others have noted, Austin can be expensive. Maybe not as crazy as CA, but much above average for TX. 

I would be cautious about moving solely because of taxes. Texas has no state income taxes. Texas does have property taxes. In CA, prop 13 tends to flatten out property taxes over time, CA makes up for it by having the highest state income taxes in the US. TX makes up for its lack of a state income tax by having some of the highest property taxes in the US. One way or another, governmental entities are going to find a way to fund their activities. If your goal is to buy a home, prices in TX will look like a bargain compared to CA. But, be prepared for some sticker shock when you see your first property tax bill.

Sales taxes in TX are slightly lower than in CA. It’s a floor of 6.25% statewide in TX, but localities can add an additional 2%. Austin definitely would be in the 8.25% category. In contrast, the sales tax in Alameda county, CA is 10.25%. Most of the other Bay Area counties have sales tax percentages that are above 9.5%, even if they are not quite as high as Alameda County. I suspect sales tax ranges are comparable for LA and Orange counties in southern CA.

The other issue here is more of a personal one. Both states have substantial Latino populations, but CA  is about 15% Asian. By contrast, TX is less than 2% Asian. My guess is that you and your wife are from
an Asian country. For example, you would find it much easier to find an Asian grocery store in CA than in TX. Yes, you can order stuff online, but that option does not work well with vegetables and can be expensive.  

If you often or even occasionally socialize with others from your native country, the opportunities  to do so in TX likely will be more limited, even in Austin.  This one could be an important issue for your spouse, especially if she has never lived in the US until now. “Culture shock” is real. 

You know her far better than we do. But, if you suspect she may need some support here, the availability of resources for someone like her may be a little easier in CA than TX. 

Good luck with all of this.",2024-05-08T16:23:37+00:00

You are right UT Austin is a big advantage and I am certainly looking to move to a city where I will be able to afford a home and have future tech opportunities.

Your concern about spouse is also very valid and thanks for bringing it out I will surely talk with her

Currently my main objective seems to be saving on the rent cost and live comfortably with her in a 1b1b apartment. 

In Bay Area for that rent would be 2000 and Austin since I am remote max it would be 1500 that alone gives me 6000$ savings

Again the  objective is to save as much money as one can. 

What I'm mainly concerned about is if I'm missing any hidden cost that will level the total COL in Austin vs CA and all the hassle would turn worthless.

Tax,comment,l34lwgk,Dino_Sore98,,"This chart is misleading since it does not carve out the impact of pass-through entities. Eighty percent of business income in the US, and more than fifty percent of business entities, are in the form of pass-throughs. This is income earned by businesses that is reported on the shareholders/owners/partners' personal tax returns, not the income withdrawn from those businesses. This greatly distorts the ""income"" of the higher percentiles.

The biggest parts of the 2017 tax bill were to get the US taxation of businesses (especially multinational businesses) in line with the rest of the OECD countries. We had the highest tax rates in the world on business income, and a repatriation system that put US multinationals at a competitive disadvantage versus our foreign competitors. These changes were being lobbied hard by the US business community for several decades, with bipartisan support throughout the Obama and Bush administrations. Unfortunately, neither of those presidents, nor Congress, made these changes a priority. This was not ""Trump's"" tax bill. It was being pushed for many years and badly needed to get the US in line with the rest of the world.

With regard to individual taxes, note that everyone's rates went down. The other significant change was the cap on SALT deductions, which HURT the higher income taxpayers. Need proof? The Attorneys General of the four highest taxed states tried to sue the Federal government to overturn the SALT limitation because it hurt the upper income taxpayers in their states.

It’s 2024, maybe we should make the tax code way more complicated. Maybe they should have everything be a deduction: bread, rent, utilities, etc. Not the whole expense, just a part of it.

Tax,post,1cmvy3c,base2final84,WA B&O tax question,"We just got word that we may owe B&O taxes to Washington that were unpaid. We use Gusto and they filed our WA excise return, but out B&O was apparently not handled properly. 

We are a WA company - LLC created there but have since gone completely remote (we’re a software consulting firm). No employees or clients in the state. No income or business operations that meet the nexus threshold. 

Does the fact that we were organized in WA mean we owe B&O on our gross receipts still?

I ask because of this sentence on the Department of Revenue page about B&O: “These thresholds will apply to all Washington income, including retailing, wholesaling, service and other activities, and other apportionable activities.”

Is our revenue considered “Washington income” if our only connection is that we were formed there years ago?",2024-05-08T04:27:59+00:00

Tax,post,1cmvs21,one-response-89,Small Business - Help With Sales Tax in Florida,"I have a sole proprietorship that sells handmade wallets via my online Shopify account. I recently saw there were a bunch of “alerts” on my Shopify account saying I needed to collect sales tax in my home state of Florida.

For reference, I’ve always paid my federal taxes…but nothing with state sales taxes. 

- In 2021, I had $21,000 in sales. ($1,000 in FL)
- In 2022, I had $12,000 in sales. ($785 in FL)
- In 2023, I had $1,500 in sales. ($0 in FL)
- In 2024, I have $200 in sales. ($0 in FL)

Clearly, I don’t do much business anymore and I’m wondering if this is just a general warning or if I need to do something? And can I get in trouble since I didn’t pay any sales tax previously?

- https://ibb.co/ZYnS9fy
- https://ibb.co/6bPn9fR
- https://ibb.co/2W8zmwV

[Here’s](https://floridarevenue.com/taxes/eservices/Pages/registration.aspx) the information on the state’s website. 

Do I need to make an account and pay for the previous sales tax that I missed? At $1,785 in sales at 7%, I believe I only owe $125. 

Does anyone have advice?",2024-05-08T04:18:07+00:00
Tax,comment,l34tioj,fitzpats9980,,"The issue you're going to run into is that when DOR figures out that you have a business, they'll not only force you to make the payment on the tax due, you'll owe interest and penalties for the complete unfiled time which could create a much larger tax liability. Additionally, they will bill you for much, much more than the $125 that you believe you owe. At that point, you may have a hard time finding suitable documentation to support your claim that you owe less than what they say you owe.

At this point, you're looking at $125 plus interest, and should be able to request abatement from penalties if they are applied. Is it worth the hassle to not pay the proper amount of taxes and not have the DOR looming over you? The statute of limitations is only on filed returns.

Tax,post,1cmvhjs,SwankyGringo,C Corp Taxation Questions,"Good Afternoon,

I am Canadian so I'm not overly familiar with US tax law, so this is likley a dumb question. I am planning to invest as an E2 investor, so I am researching C Corp vs LLC and I constantly hear the dreaded ""double taxation"" for C Corps.

But isn't a C Corp only taxed on profits? So if your business makes $100k profit and you pay yourself a salary of $80k, that $80k isn't considered profit?

You'll personally be taxed for $80k at whatever your personal tax bracket is.

And your C Corp will be taxed for $20k at 21% tax rate? Or if you re-invest the $20k you could avoid C Corp taxation altogether, right?

It's not like your C Corp gets taxed on the $100k and then you also get taxed on the $80 salary, right?

All the major corporations operate as C Corps, if the taxation was really that bad I'd figure they'd all be LLCs.

Hopefully that makes sense.",2024-05-08T04:02:02+00:00
Tax,comment,l34nyi1,Kibblesnb1ts,,"Double taxation is from the distribution of that $20 to yourself being taxed as a dividend. The $80 salary would also be taxable to you as wage income. It's really not that big a deal though IMO, especially now that corporate rates are lower. It all sort of evens out in the end. All the major players are C corps because they don't really qualify to be anything else, not much of a choice.",2024-05-08T13:43:17+00:00
Tax,comment,l34uww2,SkankOfAmerica,,">I constantly hear the dreaded ""double taxation"" for C Corps.

The ""double taxation"" only ever comes into play if a dividend is being paid.

The Corporation pays taxes on it's profits, at the corporate tax rate of 21%

If (and this is the huge if) the Corporation pays a dividend, then the shareholders receiving the dividend pay taxes on the dividend. That's the so-called double taxation.

Keep in mind... there's no requirement to pay a dividend. And.. depending on how long the shareholder has held the stock.. the dividend may potentially be considered a ""qualified dividend"" and taxed at a lower rate than that shareholders marginal tax rate.

And also keep in mind, the highest tax bracket for individuals is 37% - way more than the corporate 21%

ie, C-Corp taxation is not nearly as horrible as some people seem to think it is.

>But isn't a C Corp only taxed on profits? So if your business makes $100k profit and you pay yourself a salary of $80k, that $80k isn't considered profit?

100% Correct.

The individual of course would be taxed on their salary just like any other employed person is. And the company would of course pay payroll tax there.

>And your C Corp will be taxed for $20k at 21% tax rate?

100% Correct.

>Or if you re-invest the $20k you could avoid C Corp taxation altogether, right?

Profits are taxed at the 21% corporate tax rate, whether the Corporation distributes them as a dividend or keeps them in the company.",2024-05-08T14:27:12+00:00

Plow truck is an asset not an expense.

But.. the fees the Corp would be paying to an accountant to keep from messing that up, are an expense.

EDITED TO FURTHER EXPLAIN:

Purely from an accounting (not a tax) standpoint: All that's happening is that one asset is being exchanged for another asset of equal value. No profit nor loss has taken place. That asset will of course depreciate over time, and that depreciation will be reflected on the company books over the years to come.

Purely from a tax standpoint: you might have to spread the deduction out over time based on depreciation, or you might be able to use Section 179. It's not super simple. See also: [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p946.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p946.pdf)",2024-05-08T15:22:11+00:00

Tax,comment,l33dfnn,Nicelyvillainous,,"The irs would like to be paid early. It will charge interest if you don’t pay quarterly according to the estimated amount of taxes you owe, including if your job is withholding too little in taxes.
What it is saying is, you owed the IRS $2587 more in taxes than you had withheld through the year as of 11/15/23. Which is when the 3rd quarterly payment is due by. They charged you 8% for those 60 days, they just split it into two lines because of the end of the calendar year.
Then at 1/15 you owed your 4th quarter tax payment, and were now too low by $3449.
If you had paid $3449 to the IRS in January, I’m guessing that would have brought you up to 90% of the total tax owed for the year.



You are excused from the penalty, if the amount your job withholds from taxes is either A) at least 90% of this year’s tax amount (the amount you paid in taxes total, not what you still owed when filing the tax return), or B) at least 100% of what you paid in taxes last year.
So, basically, the amount withheld from your paycheck was too small. Done correctly, you should have had more taken out of your check and owed $2,500 or so at the end of the year, and (I’m guessing) you paid $25k total for taxes, so that would be 10% owed.
The IRS is charging interest on the difference that was short.",2024-05-08T05:47:23+00:00

I earned $193 from working at a chain restaurant working as an employee. From what I could see at the time it didn't look like I owed any taxes or needed to file so I didn't file. I only filed my federal taxes and taxes from my previous state. However, the CA FTB is saying as of last week via mail that I need to file a tax return for 2021. I watched a video from a tax expert going through form 540NR and the Schedule CA 540NR form so I think i got things mostly right on it. But, on line 40, my tax before credits (and I have no credits), is $4. However, when I go through the rest of the form it seems I owe $0. This makes no sense since I have no credits to apply.

Tax,comment,l32qeo5,VoteyDisciple,,"You will pay self-employment tax on that income no matter what you do with it afterward. That's a flat 15.3% of 92.35% of what you earn.

You will also likely pay income tax. You can deduct charitable contributions only if you are itemizing your deductions on Schedule A, so you'd need to have more than $14,600 of charitable contributions, mortgage interest, property taxes, etc. If you are able to itemize, then you would avoid income tax on the amount you're donating.

Having said that, you should probably review carefully the rules for entering the Boston Marathon. There is no way to simply join without a qualifying time on the basis that you are supporting a charity. BAA selects charities each year who are participating, and those charities choose on their own how they'd like to nominate runners who can represent their organization.

Tax,post,1cmt0c9,brickhead55,Domestic Partner to Wife Imputed Income,"Apologies for any dumb input below as I am not great with taxes. 

So I added my now wife as a domestic partner to my insurance for coverage back in 2020 while she was laid off and looking for a new job. 

We got married in Sep 2022, but I realized I never removed her as a domestic partner. I did file my taxes jointly in 2022 and 2023 with her as a spouse, and was paying for you+spouse insurance once married. 

However - I just noticed today I have been getting taxed ~400$ per paycheck for domestic partner imputed income. I do not believe I should have been getting taxed this because I was paying for a you+spouse insurance plan. Also, as of 2022 she was no longer a domestic partner, but now a wife. 

Is there any way to recollect the money that I have been taxed since we got married? Or is it all lost given that I didn’t file a life change with my insurance company once we got married. I didn’t realize I had to take her off as a domestic partner given I was paying for a you+spouse insurance plan. 

I recognize some fault here and should have been paying more attention to my paystubs. But, is there anyway to recoup lost money?

Thanks in advanced

You would see that amount being “deducted” from your check because they first added it to calculate the tax. That doesn’t mean the tax amount is $400. (Assuming you’re paid biweekly, $400 in tax would mean your wife’s insurance policy costs ~$30-40k per year, which is unlikely.) It means you pay the amount of tax due on $400 per paycheck, probably a couple of thousand per year between FICA and income tax.

However, I only contributed $3500 for the year, and this is not an employer plan. 

Obviously, I can take the full amount, which is $6500. So, the IRS assumes its employer plan because otherwise there are no other limitations, but when you file, there is no distinction on your schedule 1 for this, its just labeled ""IRA Deduction""

Tax,comment,l32bgjl,JimNtexas,,">Congress has less than two years to prevent [tax](https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/tax/) hikes on the vast majority of Americans from taking place. That’s because the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ([TCJA](https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/)) of 2017, a tax reform law that simplified individual income taxes and **reduced tax rates** [**across the income spectrum**](https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/latest-federal-income-tax-data-2024/), is set to expire. If Congress does nothing, most Americans will face higher taxes, worse incentives for work and investment, and a more complicated tax system starting in 2026.

>The [TCJA](https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/) reduced [average tax rates](https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/average-tax-rate/) for taxpayers at all income levels because it lowered [marginal tax rates](https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/marginal-tax-rate/), widened [tax brackets](https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/tax-brackets/), doubled the [child tax credit](https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/child-tax-credit/) and zeroed out personal and dependent exemptions, nearly doubled the [standard deduction](https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/standard-deduction/), and limited several [itemized deductions](https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/itemized-deduction/) and the [alternative minimum tax](https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/alternative-minimum-tax-amt/), among other changes. Although not every change the TCJA made was a tax cut—for instance, placing a $10,000 cap on itemized deductions for state and local taxes paid increased [taxable income](https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/taxable-income/) for higher-income taxpayers living in high-tax states—the net effect of all changes taken together was to reduce average tax burdens.

>In 2017, the year before the new tax changes took effect, the bottom half of taxpayers paid an [average tax rate](https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/average-tax-rate/) of 4.0 percent. After the TCJA took effect in 2018, the average tax rate for the bottom half dropped to 3.4 percent. Likewise, the average tax rate paid by the top 1 percent of taxpayers decreased from 26.8 percent in 2017 to 25.4 percent in 2018. Average rates declined across all income groups and have remained below their 2017 levels since. Further, we estimate making the individual provisions of the TCJA permanent would reduce taxes for about 62 percent of filers, leave taxes unchanged for about 29 percent, and increase taxes for just under 9 percent of filers in 2026.

The TCJA created winners and losers. A biased approach is to point out that the standard deduction was increased, while neglecting to mention that personal Exemptions were removed altogether. The net result was about equal for single filers, so it's misleading to point to that Number as being a benefit for everyone. In fact, the loss of Exemptions hurt a lot of families with many dependents. Home-ownership is even harder to sustain as itemizing became much less effective.  

The TCJA was pushed with false claims from the start. It would pay for itself, they lied. The whole thing was a temporary tax holiday to draw attention away from the permanent corporate tax cut. In the meantime our revenues shrink and our deficits grow. 

What we need to do is repeal the corporate tax cut and raise tax rates on top earners so that they have to pay their fair share. Higher rates are what we had until Reagan, but now corporations and the top 1% are hoarding profits and stalling the economy instead of reinvesting in their businesses and employees. 

Here's a left-leaning non-profit who points out that the TCJA benefits go almost entirely to the top 5%:

Tax,comment,l32iu68,Kitchen_Sweet_7353,,"Not the same person but generally there are two ways to lower inflation: monetary policy and fiscal policy. The USA generally chooses to use monetary policy: raising interest rates to reduce consumer spending. However, you can also combat inflation by raising taxes. If taxpayers give more money to Uncle Sam then logically there is less to spend on goods, driving down demand. 

Generally anything that takes money out of the economy drives down inflation. Inflation is just there being more money flowing around than there are goods and services to meet demand. 

There’s also all the repatriation that happened under the tcja with overseas earnings coming back to the USA. No idea what effects that had. 

Overall the corporate tax system was broken before and I do think it is fairer now since the rates are more in line with what s corps and other flow throughs pay. I would be interested to see if there was any current data if corporations and shareholder are actually paying less on earnings and dividends under the new rate. It was wildly fluctuating for the first few years after the tcja with some years being they were paying more others less. Interested if things have settled down.",2024-05-08T01:36:38+00:00
Tax,comment,l32tztk,foxfirek,,"More money in the economy increases inflation. During the pandemic there were 3 very large ways more money was in people’s hands. 

1) PPP loans- tons of free money up for grabs. I wrote off so many for companies that did not even have a drop in sales. 

2) reduction of max corporate tax rates from 38% to 21%. 

Separate rant: We used to tax corporations as the same rate as individuals- in return they gain many of the perks of legal individual status. But we lowered the rate and did not take away those perks. Personally I hate that. I don’t really care if they have a lower rate, but I think they should lose the ability to lobby and donate to politicians etc- if they are not paying tax like an individual. 

3) no student loan interest for a few years. 

Both putting money into the economy and not taking it out of the economy increases cash in peoples pockets without requiring additional work on their part to produce goods. Thus money is worth less and we have inflation. Bringing up interest rates has helped but not stopped inflation- PPP loans are over and student loans are no longer on hold but the corporate tax rate is still low so higher interest rates are needed to balance it out. But higher interest rates hurt the poor and help the wealthy at a higher rate than corporate tax breaks. The poor have to rely on credit cards and car loans and house interest rates- the rich can avoid all of that. You could argue that while the poor have lower tax in OP’s scenario they are in a much worse space due to interest rates. 

There now I have supplied a rant.

Family member hasn’t worked in about a decade due to many degenerative health issues. Income is around $1k/month from social security and disability. They also receive food stamps but I’m not sure how much. Rent is about $500/month. No assets, no bank accounts, no retirement/pension, etc.

They received notice from NYS about income tax debts seeking payment before they take collective action. The debts are from the late 90s and early 2000’s totaling nearly $100k (about 70% of it is interest and penalties). 

I have absolutely no background in law, taxes, or finances. I’m just the only person available to help them navigate problems/speak on their behalf when needed. We probably should consult a professional but I don’t even know who that would be. A CPA? A lawyer? I’m not even sure they could pay for a professional.

I have partnership LLC ( Husband& wife) purchased property under the LLC and filed the company taxes under schedule C. After five years when we sold the property.  NJ state asking that we should file form 1065 for the past five years. We didn’t know that we should file schedule E or 1065 form till this moment.

Again recommend you speak to a Tax Attorney in NJ, they might be able to provide better guidance.

1. **Correction of Error:** By filing an amended return to include Schedule E and rectify the initial omission, you demonstrate to the state tax authority that you are correcting your mistake. This proactive step may be viewed favorably by the state when considering penalty relief.
2. **Communication with State Tax Authority:** When you file the amended returns, you should include a cover letter or explanation outlining the reason for the amendment and the steps you've taken to rectify the error. Clearly state that you inadvertently omitted Schedule E and now seek to correct it. This communication can help the state understand your situation and may support your request for penalty abatement.
3. **Request for Penalty Abatement:** Along with the amended returns, you may formally request penalty abatement or reduction from the state tax authority. Provide any relevant information or documentation that supports your case, such as evidence of timely payment of taxes owed, lack of prior penalties, or circumstances beyond your control that led to the initial omission.
4. **State Tax Authority Discretion:** Ultimately, the decision to abate or reduce penalties rests with the state tax authority. They will review your request, along with the amended returns and supporting documentation, and determine whether to grant penalty relief based on the circumstances of your case.

Again find a tax attorney who deals with this, whether the state accepts them or not and removes the penalties is up to the state, or you might spend a bunch of money and they still assess you the penalties and fees.",2024-05-08T02:58:57+00:00

There are 2 options that are easiest. 
First, calculate the amount due using the ""Safe Harbor Method"":
--Take the amount of ""Total Tax"" from the 2nd page of the 1040 on Line 24, and subtract the amount from ""Total Payments"" on Line 33. The remainder is the amount of tax your partner needs to pay to meet the ""Safe Harbor Payment."" 


#1. Go to your work and change the withholding on your Form W4 so the extra taxes are withheld from your paycheck. 
#2.  He needs to either pay all of it on April 15 of the previous year (so by April 15, 2024 for taxes that will be filed next year-which of course has already passed), or in 4 quarterly payments throughout 2024.

Tax,post,1cmqoit,tbc13315,Help with Rental in an LLC (S-Corp),"Hi everyone,
I am hoping the hive mind of tax folks on Reddit can help me with something. Before going further- just want to note I worked with a CPA last year and am working with a new one this year (but trying to be more proactive this year to understand tax stuff).

My wife and I purchased a property as a long term SFH rental in 2023 and our previous CPA recommended an LLC/ S-corp election which we did almost immediately after purchase. This was a mistake from what I can tell based every other CPA reaction. I am now in the process of getting a new CPA to help complete last year’s personal taxes business tax for the LLC/S-corp.

A couple of things I can’t seem to find conclusive insight on:

- we would like to revoke the S-corp election  for next year’s (2024) taxes. I have filed an extension for the LLC/s-corp 2023 taxes (filed the extension on March 7 before the March 15 business tax deadline- this will also be our first business tax filing for this LLC if that matters). If we revoke the S-corp election now (it’s currently May), would the revocation count for 2024 tax year if the revocation is done during the filing of the 2023 taxes since we filed an extension? 

- to revoke the S-corp, the IRS mentions a statement of revocation is needed on their website. Various similar posts on Reddit mention a form 8832 would also have to be completed to remove any corp elective on the LLC. If the form 8832 isn’t completed after revoking the S-corp elective, would the LLC revert to a C-corp?

-just want to confirm something else I discussed with CPAs. If we remove the S-corp election from the LLC-  is there some sort of tax implication in doing so? For example- if property is worth more than when we purchased it (but probably not as much as what the initial purchase price + expenses)?

Thank you in advance for any insight anyone can provide.

22 years old, have never filed personally and have never reached the threshold required to do so. Since I have never filed I cannot be audited, considering keeping it this way. Low expenses <2k a month. 

Business does about 500k revenue yearly. Goods based, margin is ~40%. Filing for the first time and back filing the last 3 years. Will pay whatever is needed. Money is recycled back into the business each year and I pay myself very little. I want to live through my business and purchase any assets into it 

My question is, what’s the benefit or point of personally filing in my situation

One month ago I arrived and started working in the US (April 1st, moved from Mexico). I need to fill in my w4 form but I am not sure if I should specify that I am a resident (or not).

My confusion comes from the dates I should use for my calculation. If I use the date when I arrived, definitely I don’t make it for the substantial presence test (I have no green card). But if I assume the form refers for my intended stay and use Dec 31st then I think I qualify as a resident (ie more than 31 days in 2024 and longer than 180 days combining 2024, 2023, and 2022 [no days whatsoever in 2023 and 2022]).

Does anyone know if the form refers to future dates?

I gave 100K to a family member in 2023 who is able to give it back to me now. in my research it seems in the eyes of IRS this would be counted as a gift as there was no formal agreement done when i gave this money. They used money to cash purchase a house i.e no mortgage. I did not know about  *Form* 709 so i did not file that. I already filed my 2023 taxes.

1. Should i still file form 709 even though i already did my 2023 taxes? 

OR

2. Should i just get my money back and cross my fingers hopefully IRS won't bother me with anything as amount still is less than my lifetime gifting limits?

None of your facts support the position of a gift, if it was a gift you wouldn't have accepted the money back within a year. You don't simply get to choose how to report this because you didn't put it in writing.

Her federal income withholding tax was 2.3k for the year 2023 but ended up owing 2k. We filed married filing separately for 2023 as there was not much difference between filing jointly, in both scenarios she ended up owing 2k. 

We both have standard W-2s.

Her W-4 is set up as married filing jointly, 0 allowance. My W-4 is set up as single, 1 allowance, I never knew you need to update the W-4 after you get married, I will update it once i figure this out. 

She earns 50k, I earn 80k

Tax,comment,l31pdqp,Hearst-86,,"CA is the land of Prop 13. Your mortgage payment could be going up for a variety of reasons.

Home values in CA have risen dramatically in the urban areas of CA. Because of Prop 13, reassessment of home values is limited to 2%. I suggest you check your home’s current actual value on a service like Zillow and determine your home’s current value compared to your purchase price. You may discover that your home’s actual value actually has risen more than 2% a year. Would you rather have your property taxes based upon the current value versus the capped value? Over time the difference between assessed value and actual value will widen. 

You are in the early years of home ownership.  I have lived in CA for over 20 years. The value of my home because of SF Bay Area housing prices is over one million dollars. My place is nothing special. My property taxes were under $5500 last year. That happened because the assessed  value for my home for property tax purposes is about $250k. 

Most taxes in CA are high. CA has the highest state income tax in the US. But, over time you will find that your property taxes are not one of those  CA high taxes.",2024-05-07T22:22:18+00:00

Tax,post,1cmmly1,Redtech2013,Unique International Tax Conundrum: Seeking Guidance on Property Ownership in Korea for US Green Card Holder,"Hey R/Tax! 

I am very grateful to this community and thank you in advance for reading this post and for all of your help. 

I have a potentially unique tax situation and I have no idea where to start.

My wife is a US green card holder from Korea living in the US full time and 10+ years ago her parents had gifted her a home in Korea. The home is worth roughly $700,000+ and I guess at the time of the gift it was only $200,000. Her parents have been living in the home and paying the appropriate Korean taxes that we are aware of. The property also doesn’t generate any income either. 

Hence my questions that have been keeping me up at night: 

- Do we need to let the IRS know that we own this property in Korea on our US tax return and or pay any kind of taxes to the IRS? 
- If we wanted to gift the property back to her parents, would this be a taxable event in the US? We know it is for Korea, but unsure in the US. 
- If she converts her green card to become a US citizen does this change anything major when it comes to taxes for this property? Ie should she gift the property back to her parents as a Korean citizen and US green card holder before becoming a US citizen? 
- if we sell the property, I am guessing we would be on the hook to pay capital gains taxes as applicable in both US and Korea. 

Finally, any advice on what type of professional we should talk with for help? 

Thank you so much! ",2024-05-07T21:02:11+00:00

I am dealing with taxes in the appropriate manner, filing 8938, FBAR's and using 1116 FTC. I also am not concerned about prepaying large amounts early and losing opportunity/interest on this. I just want to get this over with and keep things as simple as possible even if that costs me some interest $.  


For federal taxes I am planning to hit the safe harbor of 110% of prior year (2023) taxes using paycheck withholding as well as scheduled quarterly prepayments to the IRS. No worries there.  


However, I am confused about prepayment of taxes when it comes to my state California. As I understand it, California does not have a safe harbor when income is above $1 Million and requires at least 90% of current taxes. As per FTB :  


*If your current tax year's adjusted gross income for California is equal to or greater than $1,000,000 you must pay your estimated tax based on 90% of your tax for the current tax year*.  


California also has this budgeting trick where the prepayments are not exact quarterly but Q1=30%, Q2=40%, Q3=0% and Q4=30%  


Okay so for 2023 my AGI was below $1M but in 2024 I will definitely go above $1M. Is the simplest way to just pay close (>90%) of the taxes that I calculate for the dividend and LTCG with both taxes in California as ordinary income? And send that to the FTB by the Q2 deadline of June 17? ",2024-05-07T19:33:17+00:00

* you owe back taxes either to your state or to the IRS
* you owe child support 

I think both of those can abscond with your tax refund without a court order, at least in some jurisdictions.  Cross state I'm not so sure.",2024-05-07T19:35:08+00:00
Tax,comment,l30zma2,RasputinsAssassins,,"Check with your state department of revenue or taxation. Most jurisdictions have a maximum time frame to claim missing refunds. For the IRS, for example, it is generally three years from the due date of the return. That means you could potentially have lost any refund for the 2020 tax year and prior because you did not make the claim within the allotted time frame. Some states differentiate between filing a return as a claim for refund after three years and filing on time but the refund was lost or stolen. Check with your state.

Use the correct terminology to ensure they understand why you are calling. A return is the paperwork you file to get a refund. If you ask why you have never received your return, it can lead them to send you on a wild goose chase looking for paperwork instead of a check. Let them know you have never received your state tax refunds.

Use direct deposit in the future. During tax season, theft from mailboxes increases dramatically as thieves look for refunds and SSNs to steal. It is also easier for the taxing agency to track, and you generally receive it as much as three weeks sooner.

The state may have intercepted the refunds as an offset against some debt. The most common reasons are past due taxes, past due child support, and state benefit repayment (unemployment,  Medicaid, and food stamps are the most common).

You said you requested a check. Depending on how you filed and paid, it is possible that your tax firm or software used a third-party bank to hold the fees out of the refund. If the state refund comes in first, they will hold the fees out of it, making it much smaller or even completely taking it (with the rest coming out of the federal refund).

Lastly, check your bank statement for random deposits that you may have forgotten about. I can't tell you the number of clients who received $5,000+ stimulus payments and never noticed it in their bank account.",2024-05-07T19:51:02+00:00

I would add the following as well:

1. If the company has a lot of debt (i.e., financing for equipment), then be careful of at-risk basis issues. In a scenario where the shareholder has personal guarantees on these loans, at-risk basis is not increased in an S corp, but would be increased in an LLC. In a situation like this, an LLC/partnership could be more tax advantageous. Many S corps owners are in hot water these days due to EIDLs not providing at-risk basis.

2. The regs have way too many incentives for shareholders to pay themselves a lower wage. Yes, SE/FICA/Medicare is one item to consider, but if it's a matter of Single member LLC/Sole prop versus S corp, then the QBI deduction and PTE tax could benefit from an S corp structure. QBI because it's limited to 50% of wages above certain thresholds, and PTE because it's only eligible for flow-through entities (LLC would work for this as well, but only if it's multi-member).

So as a sole proprietor/partner, the person's (net profit - 1/2 SE tax) would only have to be $170k + the amount they'd be contributing as an ER contribution (same as would be needed to make the contribution as an S-Corp).

Correct, but you also need to factor into the calculations that with a Sch C/Partnership, the full amount of (net profit - 1/2 SE tax - SE retirement plan contributions) would potentially be eligible for the QBI deduction, instead of only the S-Corp profit.

In both cases, the person will not be taxed on the employer half of SE/FICA taxes, nor are they taxed on their EE or ER retirement account contributions (assuming they're Trad- and not Roth).

So, yes, filing as sole-prop/partner, means they'll potentially pay Medicare tax on more of their income, but they can make the same retirement contributions (at potentially lower income), and can get a higher QBI deduction (assuming they qualify).

Need some help with possibly a simple answer. My partner filed taxes as soon as the season started. He was supposed to get a state and federal refund. He got his federal refund relatively quickly. Come March we move to a different state. By this time we called our accountant multiple times to be told to wait, the bill for child tax increase might pass, everything was filed just wait wait wait. Come April we call again, still no refund. This time we’re asked if we got a letter in the mail. We inform them we’ve moved (something we warned them about in January when we filed). They updated the address on our file and said to wait. Everything was done on their end. 


I start looking online and realize we could check the refund status for state, make an account and find out a letter was mailed in late March to our old address, due early April. It stated a copy of my partners W2 was needed even though we gave a copy to the accountant when we filed. We were three days late on the notice due date when we saw the electronic copy. We submitted it immediately and explained the situation in the notes. We’ve reached out to the accountant multiple times now and there’s no answer (they rarely answer in general). Now it says to wait up to 90 days for the request to process on the departments end. 


Can anyone know what may have went wrong? Why would they need a W2 again when that was supposed to be submitted when we filed? Is there any way to speed up the process now? Will they let us know if anything else is missing or is there a chance we’ll wait up to 90 days just for something else to come up again?

Tax,post,1cmhl3k,Business-Questions,Backdoor Roth IRA (State: NJ) & 1-800-Accountant,"So I foolishly hired 1-800-Accountant to do my taxes because I had a new business and didn’t want to get in any trouble for not doing my business tax return properly. The service comes with personal tax return filing and I am having trouble getting them to remove my contribution of post-tax income into a traditional IRA that I then rolled into a Roth IRA (back-door style) as a taxable amount at the NJ level. Essentially, they are telling me it is correct that I would be taxed twice at the NJ level for this contribution. For federal they have it removed (all good there), but can’t seem to get it done at the NJ level. Am I wrong here in thinking that double tax at the state level must be wrong? I have told them I can provide whatever forms they need or documentation to prove that I used post-tax income from my W2 income to deposit into the traditional IRA that I then rolled over 1:1 into the Roth, but they are not taking me up on that and telling me the return is correct as is. The key is line item 20a. (NJ) needs to be $0 and not $6,500. 

Further, any advice on forms I could provide outside of the 1099, which just has “taxable amount not determined” checked off to get them to see my POV? I have asked them to provide me an 8606 (as prior posts says that’s the form I need), but no luck there. 

Thanks in advance for any insight!

Tax,post,1cmhapo,supernasty,2nd year in a row that I OWE money during tax season. What could cause this? ,"So I worked remotely in Tennessee (while working for a California company) for 2 years. I had a residence, state ID, and car registration in Tennessee during these 2 years, but still paid income tax from California. I moved back to California exactly 1 year ago, re-registered everything back to California (ID, registration, residence) but I still owed $500 for the 2nd year in a row. I used an accountant, and all he told me was ""moving state lines"" but I still owed money the year before as well while still living in TN. 

Outside of working out of state, I also cashed in on $9,000 worth of stocks that I transferred into my credit account to pay off the debt from my move across country. That's the only thing I'm knowledgeable in that I believe would impact my tax refund, but had no idea it would turn the typical $1,400 return I'd receive (from previous years) into owing $500 and receiving nothing.

Tax,comment,l32djen,FP1234567890,,"Tax liabilities you’ve referenced in your post:

W-2 income (will have federal and state tax withholding taken out of pay before receiving your paycheck).

Cashing in stocks (which becomes taxable income that no federal or state withholdings have been taken out of the money you receive)

Withholdings for each (federal and state) are mini payments towards taxes due at the end of the year. If someone ends up owing a lot at the end of the year, they can ask their HR department (or boss if a smaller company) to increase their withholdings. If a person is getting too large of a refund, they can ask to decrease their withholdings.

For taxable income that occurs that’s out of the persons usually income (ex. cash out of stocks, lump sum withdrawals from retirement account, gambling winnings…) a person can make an estimated payment for the tax due on it. One way to do this is filing out a tax form for the pervious year to find the estimated amount it will likely cause (so that you have an estimation of the additional taxes that will be due at the end of the year) and then just make an estimated tax payment (one to the IRS and one to the state; or quarterly payments to each that add up to the payment due).

Some have commented on the amount of refund being too big (1,400). I consider this personal preference. Some consider it an, “interest free loan” to the government and say that you could have invested it otherwise. Others consider it peace of mind that they don’t owe the government anything and that if they make a mistake (or credit/deduction they think they qualify for, but then don’t), then they’ve given themselves a buffer to make sure they don’t end up in debt to the government. 

My guess is that the difference is likely due to the cashing out the stocks.",2024-05-08T01:00:50+00:00

Tax,comment,l33hlvh,treis-gates,,"(This is what I do for a living, but I’m not your tax person)

Lots to unpack here…let’s start with your time in TN. You said you still paid CA tax…did you update your address and state tax information with your employer?  You should have only paid tax to CA if (1) you were still a CA tax resident, or (2) you performed services in CA. 

State tax residency is complicated and very personal, so most companies don’t even attempt to make such a determination - generally, if you tell them you’re living in TN, they’ll tax you based on TN rules (which means no tax…).

If they were still taxing you in CA, you should ask why. Generally, it’s just payroll being incompetent and taxing you based on where you were hired, not where you’re performing services. US states tax based on residency and service/presence….if you’re not resident, you only get taxed based on service/presence. 

As to your overarching owing vs refund question, the answer is quite simple - your withholding taxes were lower than your tax liability.  The withholding tax tables have been largely screwed for the last several years, so this isn’t that uncommon. 

It’s hard to say what happened to you without more detail, but any tax event where no withholding is applied (such as capital gains on a sale of stock) would impact this, as will your withholding allowances.  I’m not sure what “cashed in” on the stocks really means, but your broker would have reported the proceeds…and you may have had a capital gain. 

If that’s not it, it might just be your withholding elections. Review your W-4 allowances and consider reducing them - this will increase your withholding throughout the year. 

If you got a bonus or other types of supplemental compensation, it’s also possible that your effective tax rate was higher than the supplemental rate (the federal rate is only 22% on the first $1M of supplemental compensation).",2024-05-08T06:35:17+00:00

Tax,comment,l32hi09,NegotiationJumpy4837,,"There are two separate ideas to think about with taxes. Total taxes due vs refund/owing.  A w2 worker pays an estimated amount towards the total taxes due every 2 weeks; that is the withholding you do from your paycheck. During tax time, you compute how close your withheld/estimated taxes were and reconcile the difference. Eg. you pay $500/2 weeks or 13k for the year in withheld/estimated taxes. During tax time, you are actually figuring out the total due for the year and how close you were to your estimate. Maybe the total taxes due is 12.5k and you now get a $500 refund (since you already paid 13k throughout the year). Maybe the total taxes due is 14k and you now owe $1k extra (because you only paid 13k throughout the year). However, you can tweak how much the estimated payments were throughout the year. So a refund vs owing taxes is largely a function of whether you over or underpaid the estimated taxes throughout the year.

If that explanation makes sense, you may be able to see that the total amount paid is mostly all that matters. Most people focus on refund/taxes owed though as it feels nice to get a lump sum refund. However, I could theoretically get a 25k refund every year if I wanted to. All I would have to do is log into the IRS's site and make an extra 25k payment in advance. That doesn't sound very exciting though, does it? But that's functionally equivalent to how all refunds work.",2024-05-08T01:27:30+00:00

Tax,comment,l32wet5,NegotiationJumpy4837,,">Are there any disadvantages/penalties if paid $0 tax upfront and then pay entire tax due at tax return time?

There's typically going to be tax penalties involved. If you get a penalty, it's the federal short-term rate plus 3%, which is currently an 8%/yr penalty on the amount underpaid. So it's sort of like taking an 8% loan, which may or may not be advantageous, depending on what else you can do with your money. I'd generally advise against it though, especially if there's even a small chance you won't have enough money to pay the taxes on tax day.

There are some exceptions to the penalty though, so it occasionally doesn't apply.",2024-05-08T03:11:23+00:00

Another part of the credit *is* refundable and that's what she received. I'm not sure why it was $1200 specifically, I'd have to look at her whole tax return.


In 2021 the tax credits were temporarily expended, that may be why you heard of big refunds.

Tax,post,1cmecxc,reaper57201,"Purchasing land from uncles at 0% interest, question on imputed interest.","Hello. I have the extremely fortunate circumstance to buy some investment land from 2 uncles (shared owners) at a 0% interest rate. I am trying to figure out the best way to prevent them from being on the hook with extra taxes.

The land in question is 500k and we are putting 100k down and then financing the 400k from them (prom note  or contract for deed) at 0% interest for 30 years. I know they will be on the hook for imputed interest for this, but I am wondering if the imputed interest will fall under the gift tax rules in which if the gifted amount is under 18k annually, it doesn't have to be reported (to the lifetime gift limit) and they won't owe taxes on it? Since between the 2 of them (as 50/50 owners) their due/imputed interest would be well below that.   


The property will produce around 13k a year in income. Not sure if that is totally relevant to this. I think the long term AFR for May 2024 is like 4.55%?

  
So my question is, am I correct in assuming we can continue this loan without them facing gift tax liability?

",2024-05-07T15:16:40+00:00
Tax,comment,l30bhv8,HospitalWeird9197,,"Generally, interest on a no interest inter family loan will be imputed at the appropriate AFR (for the 30 year term, you are correct using the long term AFR), and will be deemed to have been transferred from the lender to the borrower as a taxable gift (and to answer part of OP’s question, this does qualify for the annual exclusion up to $18,000, assuming no other taxable gifts from lender to borrower), and then from the borrower to the lender as taxable interest income. 

So your uncles would have no gift tax impact because the $9,100 in annual imputed interest each would be under the annual exclusion, assuming no other gifts to you, and doesn’t even need to be reported (unless they otherwise have to file a gift tax return). However, they will pay income tax on the $9,100 of phantom interest income. 

If you wanted to make a gift to them to cover the income tax on the $9,100, I suppose that would make everyone even steven, but I haven’t thought through whether there might be any step transaction implications to that.

There are some deminimis and limiting rules for total loans between borrower and lender under $10,000 and $100,000, but that’s obviously not applicable here.",2024-05-07T17:31:05+00:00

Well, I guess I am not actually paying them that interest then so it would be...hmmmm

In this scenario, then it would almost be better to reduce the principal amount to 200 something thousand that would then be at 4.55% and over 30 years  get us to that 400k total. They would just have to file a gift tax for the ~200k below market value for the year we set this up and then that would count towards their lifetime max.

1.  Report rents as income in Schedule E
2.  Report expenses on Schedule E(property taxes, repairs, management fees, ect.)
3.  Figure your adjusted basis for depreciation (generally purchase price (less land value) plus improvements). The tax basis is the lesser of fair market or adjusted basis.  Usually for houses which appreciate in value your tax basis is the adjusted basis.

You will pay income taxes on your net profit from renting after deducting expenses and depreciation of your home.  If you have a loss after that you can generally deduct up to $25k a year in passive losses.  If your AGI is too high you may not be able to deduct losses.

When you sell the house you will pay ordinary tax rates on the depreciation recapture, and capital gains on the rest.  Since you converted it to business property you can deduct the capital loss, if there is one when you sell it.  Personal residence you cannot deduct the loss.

Also certain tax credits are not available on rental property (Solar Tax Credit, Energy efficient Home Improvement) or the process for claiming them is far more complicated, so if you want to claim certain credits do it before you convert it to business property.

Tax,post,1cmdiau,Super_Debt2042,Do I have to pay NYC local tax for gains realized before move there? Can I get out of paying NYC tax all together?,"Hello everyone and thank for taking the time to read my questions. So, I'm currently a grad student graduating later this month and I currently live in a part of NY with no local tax. On 7/1 I'm moving to NYC. All of my earned income for 2024 will be after 7/1. I sold some stocks in April with about $3k in long term capital gains which I understand is taxed as ordinary income in NYC. Would I have to pay local tax on this even though I wasn't living in NYC when I realized the gains?

Also is there any way in which I can claim that for tax purposes my residence for 2024 is the place I'm currently living in which has no local tax since I did live there for half the year or is my residence determined by where I live when I file or where I live when I earned my wages? If it matters, the place I'm currently living is my mom's house which she will continue to live in for the rest of the year.

Tax,post,1cmd20b,Helilio,Tax interest dispute with county treasury ,"Hi All, 

My wife and I bought a condo in FL(we don’t live in FL), and have been doing short term rental business(airbnb) since 6 years ago.. 

We recently received a letter from the county treasury stating that we owe all the tourism development tax since the beginning, which is about $50k+(almost 20k is just interests). 

This was a big surprise for us since we’ve never heard about such tax or reached out by anyone during the 6 years at all. 

So we called the treasury office and they basically said they never had enough people to check this, only hired someone a couple years ago, and they basically search on airbnb to check their taxes status one by one. 

We totally understand the difficulty and willing to pay all the taxes we owe, but I wonder if there’s anything I can do to dispute about the interests? 

If we were informed by anyone or airbnb earlier, for sure we wouldn’t be owning anything at all. Also this tax only exists in this specific county…..We’ve never received a single letter during the past 6 years.

Tax,comment,l349mra,HospitalWeird9197,,"OP, you are likely out of luck.  The vast majority of Florida counties have a tourist development tax for transient rentals.  For those that do, it ranges between 3% and 6% on top of sales and use tax. Some counties have the DOR collect the TDT for them and for those counties, TDTs are remitted to the DOR with your sales and use tax return and tax.  Other counties collect the TDT directly and you send a separate sales and use tax return to the county with the TDT.  Sounds like your county is one that collects directly.  No statute of limitations because no return filed with the county.  Assuming you paid sales and use tax correctly, they have access to the accurate numbers.  Penalties, if any, might be able to be abated, but generally the taxing jurisdiction has no authority to waive interest.

I'm curious, did you not read the sales and use tax return instructions?  It is very clear that counties can impose local option taxes on transient rentals and that you need to look up your particular county and see whether there is one and if so, how to remit the tax.",2024-05-08T11:58:40+00:00

Distant relative passed away in January 2023. To my surprise, I was part of the will and set to receive part of the estate (\~5%). I was moving that month and gave my new address. I ended up not moving because of job issues and completely forgot about the estate. Now, I just received form 1041, schedule k-1 for the estate closure with the address I never actually lived at. In addition, I need to amend my 2023 federal tax returns to include the Form 1041, schedule k-1.

  
Do I need to contact the tax preparer who put this together to fix the address? Or can I just move forward with my actual address that I live at and file taxes for in 2023? The letter does indicate this is the final K-1 that I will receive from the estate.

  
Also what is the deadline for amending my taxes? Letter is dated 3/15/2024 but I can't find exact info on when this needs to be done by.

Tax,post,1cmb31s,Pantofuro,"Capital gains deductions on a house sale
","
I'm planning on selling my primary house soon and purchasing a new one because of life events. I likely will end up doing this before I hit the two year mark, trying to avoid that, but I'm not sure how that will go. In the likely case that I can't,  I'm trying to figure out what my taxes will look like, and if any of these can be deductions against long term capital gains. I was confused about the BAR test.

Specifically are these improvements or repairs. Under these betterment and restoration definitions, they look like they could be improvements.

Betterment – an expenditure results in a betterment if it ameliorates a condition or defect that existed before the acquisition of the property or arose during the production of the property; is for a material addition to the property; or increases the property’s productivity, efficiency, strength, etc.

Or 

Restoration:
replaces a major component or substantial structural part of the unit of property. 


Gutters, new, not replacement professional install at $1800. Seems to be a clear improvement.

Garage repair: started collapsing, new supports and cross beams, $2,600. The reason I think this may be betterment is because the garage is attached to the home and was constructed with little to no cross beams. Essentially a defect in the construction. New structural beams had to be added.

Foundation repair and drainage pattern changes: about 30 ft of new concrete to shore collapsing and bowing wall. New fill to have water flow away from house. $15,820. To add more detail, I have a structural engineers report showing the foundation had failed prior to purchase. The seller did a small patch job with some concrete on a corner, but not to what was outlined in the structural report. In order to prevent the collapse of the backside of the house, 1/3 of the house foundation needed to be shored up. So a 4 ft tall, around 30-40 ft, 18 inch thick  wall was built against the existing foundation. Prior to this repair, the foundation was 100 year old laid stone. The cracks were big enough to put a hand through with daylight showing through the cracks. This seemed like it could be a restoration or maybe betterment. It did end up increasing the value of the house. 

New basement insulation and heater: $2,300. I claimed the insulation as a deduction on my yearly taxes, so I'm not sure I could claim it against capital gains, from my reading, I probably can't.

Would anyone know if these, especially the foundation repair could be considered deductions on capital gains? I don't believe these repairs are considered normal and they extend the life of the home similar to a roof replacement as a major structural component, but I'm not sure that is enough to be deductible by the IRS. Based on my reading of the rules, it could be, but it looks like it may be a judgement call.

Thank you",2024-05-07T12:47:28+00:00
Tax,comment,l307zw9,CollegeConsistent941,,"As a retired tax professional I would classify as follows: Gutters: improvement, Garage: repair, Foundation: mix of repair and improvement.

Tax,comment,l3047n6,Ironfour_ZeroLP,,"Probably best to deal with it as it comes and not spend energy worrying for a few reasons:

1) They will typically give you another 30-60 days to respond (especially if you ask for more time). So there won't be urgency to respond immediately. You will have 1-2 months to figure it out then. It might be practically nothing, just a small request for paperwork (like a healthcare eligibility form). The reason they say it will be 60 days is more likely to be because they are overwhelmed, than that this is a big case.

2) Generally they are pretty reasonable as long as you engage them and haven't knowingly engaged in something extremely illegal. Having dealt with auditors, they just want paperwork that things make sense and as long as you do that in a timely and respectful manner, things are fine! Things generally get ugly only if you put your head in the sand and ignore their attempts to contact you and miss deadlines. But they are telling you it will be 60 days plus your 30-60 days to respond before that becomes an issue - so like August/September

3) If for some reason they say you owe money and you spent your refund, you can likely get a payment plan. So you can spread it out and not be in a lurch.

So do what you need to do right now, then mentally put it in a box and don't worry about it until you get the response.",2024-05-07T16:48:20+00:00

Something to keep in mind: Any foreign bank account that has more than $10K USD at any time during the year is required to be reported to FinCEN. If your parents are depositing this into a local bank for them and then you're importing the money into a US financial institution, you'll need to report the foreign account.

2. If instead of gifting her the money, I choose to ‘lend’ her the money - my understanding is I wont have to file the gift tax return. I would need to charge the minimum interest rate (AFR) and pay taxes on that at the end of the year. Is this correct?

1)  You can gift her the $200,000, file Form 709 to report the gift.  Assuming you have made no other gifts previously (first 709 filing, or if previously filed, with available lifetime exclusion remaining), then there will be no gift tax due.  As you mention, it simply will reduce your remaining lifetime allowance.

2)  You can lend her the money - no 709 filing requirement.  While you will have to charge interest as you mention using the AFR (and report this interest you receive as income), because this loan is not categorized as a mortgage, your sibling will not be able to ""deduct"" it (if applicable) as it would be ""personal interest.""  Additionally, if your sibling is taking out a mortgage to finance the remaining purchase price, the lender might have an issue with a second creditor (you) having claim against the underlying secured asset.

If you don't anticipate being over the estate tax threshold (be it where it currently is, or where it will drop back to in 2026 absent an act of congress), go the 709 route.  If you expect that you will ultimately be subject to the estate tax, then your decision might be complicated by any potential difficulties your sibling might encounter should she also seek traditional financing via a mortgage.",2024-05-07T12:29:47+00:00

You should have a promissory note written with current market rate interest.

Tax,comment,l3025lc,Why-R-People-So-Dumb,,"This whole discussion chain assumes that you don't need the thing for business, the question didn't say how are people misguided with the concept of write-offs or abusing it but simply what they are. 

There are a handful of things to consider when someone says I ""need"" write-offs because your simple math is not how it always shakes out, sure you say so but even only slightly less simple, and fairly commonly, your math is blown out of the water. Even just consider you are missing SE taxes. There is a reason that tax equity can be worth more than one to one. 

Consider you file extensions and file your return in October. Consider you pay quarterly estimated taxes. Now consider you also operate on an accrual basis and don't have the cash flow in April when you file your extension but also consider that you accrued income late in the year you weren't expecting. Now consider you also have self employment tax...my pre write-off tax basis is close to 50%. Now consider if I owe more than 10,000 at the end of the year, I owe penalties *and* interest up until I pay that debt off. Generally speaking as long as I'm not spending more than my overage I am getting close to a 1:1 write-off meaning that item cost me almost the same as the taxes would have, so if I get a surprise but contract at the end of the year and was going to buy a truck Q1 next year anyway it makes sense to bump up that purchase for the write-off, keep in mind you may be able to also write off the cost of capital. Now you could say well just pay more in taxes throughout the year but then again, what's the cost of a business line of credit or the lost opportunity with a RFR of 6% right now?

So while it's correct a write-off doesn't magically get you money you didn't earn, it's not so simple to say it's a 22% discount on the item and presume that item is always a frivolous purchase. In my line of business we actually sell tax equity of projects to people for more than the write-off itself, because sometimes $1 doesn't equal $1 in tax land. The other thing we aren't considering is that some people don't want their gross income to exceed certain thresholds for other reasons. Even on the example above say you operate on a cash flow basis and don't want to trigger being large enough for accrual basis.  You can also consider the CGL and EO could also be impacted. Done right, write offs encourage you to spend when you earn money and not operate on debt and you can lever quite a bit of personal gain while still not committing tax fraud. 

An example of the last point, and why a simple post of saying you only get your marginal rate back, carrying forward with the car example. I don't like to use my business car for personal driving, both for tax purposes as well as liability purposes. I barely drive personally so a car not suitable for business anymore is still suitable personally. The business buys a new vehicle and is written off as stated above. I buy the fully depreciated car off of my company for DMV arms length deal which doesn't count as business income, I *do not* have to come up with cash for my purchase of the personal vehicle because in my double ledger accounting the asset is debited with a credit from the ""payment,"" the payment is made up with a new liability that debits business assets and credits a ""guaranteed payment."" Now I have not received money but I have received the value of the guaranteed payment and owe taxes.  I drive my old car down to CarMax, which has barely depreciated since I purchased it from the company, and get a check for that car that more than covers the I come tax I just laid to buy my next new car off the company.",2024-05-07T16:36:20+00:00

Tax,post,1cm3wtj,StructureLegitimate7,Someone claimed my dependents,"I’m feeling defeated right now and can use some advice. We(my wife and I) were taking care of my sister and my brother from 2018 - 2021. We took them in and enrolled them in school. We took on the responsibility even though we were making barely any money. I was the only person in the family who had a stable enough life to take care of them. This put huge strain on us financially. But, they were my siblings and we weren’t going to turn our backs on them.

Enough of the sob story and to the point. I’m in a much better financial situation now that me and my wife are on our own because they have left to go live somewhere else(by their own accord, we did not make them leave, they are both over the age of 18 now) and I am making more money now. But, in 2021 when I tried to claim my sister as a dependent, it had gotten rejected because her dad filed for her. She was living with her me for some of 2021 and  going back and forth between her mom’s new apartment and my house. I was filling their apartment with groceries and lending them money frequently. It was almost half the year she had lived with me in 2021. Her mom and I agreed that I would file. So when I went to file it was rejected. Her dad filed for her. Her dad lives in a different state and she went and visited him that year but never had residency there(unless he did something shady with her address).

I was willing to let that go. But, I haven’t amended those taxes for 2021 yet. The reason I am thinking about fighting it now is because my mom is struggling financially , and when she was taking care of my brother for the tax year 2023, his dad(same dad as sister) also claimed him. Even though my brother only lived with him 2 months out of the year. She took care of him for 10 months. Our mom never agreed to this with her ex husband (brother and sisters dad).

Sorry if this story is a little confusing I am willing to clarify.

Everything below this is the edit: Title says my dependents, but it should really say mine and my moms dependents. They were claimed by family/father who lives out of state, and did not have either of the dependents for more than 2 months when he did have them.

What can I do? For me I want to file my 2021 taxes, and possibly make this guy have to pay back that money out of principal. Whatever I got from the money for the year where he claimed my dependent I would help my mom with. I want to help my mom with her 2023 taxes and for her to be able to claim her dependents, rightfully. I don't know if it is worth it to fight it though.

* If you have to setup security questions. Don't give real answers. I just use my password manager to generate random codes for the answers. Then store the question and answer in the password manager notes field for each account. Check your security questions in each account and change the answers to the garbage answers.
* Export backups of your password manager occasionally. Lock them in a password protected excel file.
* Never use personal info in a password or reuse a password.
* Enable two factor authentication. Use at least SMS for authentication codes. Using an authenticator app is better, especially for important accounts like [ID.Me](http://ID.Me) or banking. If you use an Authenticator. Save those backup codes in a secure manner. In case you lose access to the authenticator.
* You need to setup an IP Pin for yours and your children's IRS accounts. The IRS will mail you an IP Pin every year for doing your taxes. Also notify the IRS of the fraud.
* Check your profile in every account. Make sure there are no unknown email addresses or phone numbers for resetting your account.
* Check your accounts if there is an option to remove all devices currently logged in.
* Notify any other account effected of fraud. Namely IRS, [ID.Me](http://ID.Me), IRS, cashapp (since someone used their service for fraud)
* With banking and credit cards you'll want to check if there are any other authorized users or administrators. With SSA you'll want to see if there are any unknown authorized representatives on your son's account.

Tax,post,1cm0v7y,Dense-Charity-1916,Is there a way to apply Covid relief to tax debt?,"So, long story short, I hadn't filed taxes for ten years. Those years were low-income years, so the amount owed wasn't super high, but penalties add up etc. Plus, it seems a lot of what I owe is social security. I guess that gives me incentive to live to see 80 or whatever the payout date for that will be in the future.

I went to the wrong accountant cuz he charged me a fortune to file 5 returns (300 each, one of the best one hour paydays I've ever seen in person). He caters to the upper class community, so its my own fault. I shoulda went to HR Block. Regardless, I had to stop him cuz I didnt wanna pay another 1500, so if the IRS needs those other 5 years, then I will fill them out myself. 

Queston is- my accountant ""couldnt"" help me understand the Covid relief payment. When I type it in, I see organizations that claim there was Covid relief for self-employed people. I'm not sure if I'd be eligible for any of that (Im technically a sole proprietor), but I should be eligible for the Covid relief payment to individuals that is about to expire. I was hoping to apply it to my debt. Does anyone know how exactly I do that? What am I looking for? Covid fund payments? I keep encountering proprietary sites promising money back (accounting firms marketing their relief fund services), so I'm clearly typing in the wrong key words. 

Also, is money owed on social security also eligible for payment plans? Or is that separate from the taxes? Thanks!",2024-05-07T02:15:54+00:00

Tax,post,1clxppe,Limitedservice,Overlapping IRS notice and amended return - best path to resolution?,"I filed for an extension through turbotax last year, paying estimated tax due at that point (call it payment X).   
  
When I finally filed months later, I didnt realize that turbotax already knew about payment X, and had recorded it in a different spot/form than my other estimated tax payments made earlier for 2022. I entered the payment X as additional ""estimated tax paid"" because it didnt show up where I expected it, so that I essentially claimed to have paid the amount of X twice.  
  
I realized a couple weeks later that the resulting refund calculated by turbotax was too high by exactly X, and used turbotax to file an amended return that removed the amount X from the estimated tax payments made. For some reason, turbotax at that point also wanted me to pay the amount of X again. Call me an idiot, but I didnt question that and just paid it - but that makes a little less sense to me now - either I pay what I claimed on my return, or I correct the return to reflect what I actually paid, but why both? 

Because this isnt confusing enough, a week after filing the amended return I get a notice from the IRS saying ""buddy you claimed to have paid 2\*X when we only got X, so here is what is actually still due, please pay (much less than X)"". I just thought, well, they didnt get around to processing my amended return and the extra payment of X I made, so I'll just wait for them to get to it, before adding more pending stuff to that queue.

But nothing until now. I filed for an extension for 2023 as well, but before filing I think I probably need to sort this out with some actual humans in the mix (but I hate appointments and phone back and forth, would prefer electronic).  
  
My question: What's the least hassle to get this sorted out? I dont have a ""local trusted"" CPA or tax guy so getting one would be hassle, too. I tried getting someone on the phone at the IRS to tell me what to do next, but that was just an eternity on hold. Should I try TurboTax with their expert help option?

Essentially they mailed me documents with line items of crypto that I had ""sold or disposed of"" from 2 crypto trading platforms that I had used in the past and did not report them. The reason I did not think I had to report it was because I had moved my crypto to a online sportsbook and had lost everything. I no longer have access to my wins and losses receipts from the sports book that I had used, and so I am fine with paying the $4.1K.

If I were to sell all of my long term holdings, my estimated AGI plus the gains from the long term holdings should stay under the 89k where long term gains are taxed at 0%.

So my thinking is to sell all of those holdings and repurchase them basically right after so I can reset my capital gains.

Tax,comment,l2wr6y7,vynm2,,">But if she was a non-citizen, non-resident, with non-US sourced income when it was earned then she had no US tax liability.

This is most likely not correct if OP and their spouse are going to be filing a joint return for 2024. In order to do that, OP's spouse's worldwide income will need to be reported on their US MFJ return.

That said, they may be able to use the FTC or FEIE to mitigate any US tax due on that income, BUT that income will still affect the tax brackets that OP's income is taxed in. 

For example for FEIE, the tax is calculated using the Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet on [p. 37 of the 1040 instructions](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf#page=37) (for 2023, it will be similar in 2024). Basically, the tax is calculated on all income including that which is excluded using the FEIE and then the amount of tax that would have been paid on the amount excluded using the FEIE is subtracted. SO, OP's LTCG may NOT fall in the 0% bracket like they hope.",2024-05-07T00:17:04+00:00

Since you'll be married, you'll need to file either MFS or MFJ. If you make the election to file as MFJ (to get your double tax brackets), then your spouse's worldwide income will need to be included on your tax return. Even if the tax on their non-US income is mitigated by the FEIE (Foreign Earned Income Exclusion) or FTC (Foreign Tax Credit), it could still push your income into the higher tax brackets.

Tax,post,1clvxtw,lilycron,Why isn’t there a tax on capital investments similar to property tax?,"I understand that there is already a tax on gain on sale of investment, but this just doesn’t seem to be enough. You can have an investment and sit on it for years or generations and never be taxed on it. The only thing that does get this tax is real estate, which is often owned by normal families. Why is that?

From what I’ve learned about taxes surrounding investment they are written in such a way to incentive investing because investing helps the economy grow. However, economy growth isn’t that useful if there is huge income inequality and only a handful of people benefit from it. And that’s the situation we are in right now. 

I think that a small, bracketed tax on investments could be a good way to even out the income inequality a bit. I would probably say that the tax would exempt 401Ks and roth accounts.

And then follow-up question- so, say the economy is going gangbusters, I'm making $120k/year, my investments are up 15%, and I owe $$$$ in taxes. Now the economy takes a dump, I lose my 6-figure job, my income is the $20k I made in 2 months before I got canned, and my investments took a 30% hit. So, hopefully you said that since I get taxed on imaginary gains, I get to deduct my imaginary losses... what rate do I get to deduct my imaginary losses at?

Tax,comment,l37y7mm,penguinise,,">While capital is intangible it is actually also excludable, when I buy stock from a public company, no one else can possess that share and there are less shares available to be bought unless the company makes more.

Sure, but ""that share"" isn't actually something that exists.  Your possession of the share is purely intangible, and you aren't actually *possessing* any tangible object or thereby excluding someone else from possessing anything.  As you note, the company can simply issue more shares, and in fact companies do this all the time.

There are macroeconomic arguments that the possession of intangible wealth is not completely without effect (the money supply impacts inflation, for example) but as a fairly close to perfect example, when Tesla ""grew"" to become a trillion-dollar company, most of those trillion dollars were basically created anew.  Elon Musk's fortune wasn't taken at anyone's expense: there are just *more dollars* now.

>As for your argument that the tax would be redundant because of existing property tax: while there is a redundancy, the tax burden falls on different parties, one goes on the company, the other on a shareholder

The ""company"" doesn't really exist; it is also an intangible person.  If I own a share of Berkshire Hathaway, which owns the BNSF railroad, which owns land with railroad tracks on them, how many times does tax need to be paid on that land?

>I don’t think I understand your last point. A tax levy on a tangible item would not incentive people to buy it, the opposite would happen. And I don’t know what this right to not use has to do with anything

One of the fundamental property rights in the Western concept of property law is the *right to waste*.  That is, if I hold title to something in fee simple, I have the right to do whatever I want with it, including *nothing*.  In the abstract, that might mean I can own 100 acres of land in the middle of Manhattan and kick everyone out, razing the structures to the ground and forbidding anyone entry.

It should be obvious that such behavior not in the interest of society.  One of the main purposes of a property tax (or, rightly, a land value tax) is to disincentivize such behavior.  Because I have to pay a tax in order to maintain title to such land, and because that tax is based on the value of the land, I have a strong incentive to put the land to *productive use*, such as building things on it and making it available to other people to use for a reasonable rent determined by the free market.  If I don't know how to bring productive use to the land, I have an incentive to sell it to whomever can do so.  Without property tax, there is far less incentive to develop useful land.

There's no functional reason why you can't levy a wealth tax on intangible wealth as well, but it would not serve the same economic purpose as a property tax.",2024-05-09T01:32:54+00:00
Tax,comment,l344xzt,Kitchen_Sweet_7353,,"On your second point about just selling the stocks to get cash to pay the taxes: that might be fine for regular investors who own a variety of stocks in a brokerage account.

Tax,comment,l35ybto,lilycron,,"Hmm, that’s true. It would be pretty hard to scrounge up the cash if you owned a large share of a company of any size, and you couldn’t just sell it like you would a normal stock. Even Jeffery bezos would find it difficult to pay the taxes on his Amazon shares. Plus if they own shares and they’re the ceo, this incentives them to increase their salary, which is part of the problem of inequality.  You could argue for the tax only being levied on small percentage shares, but then that would defeat the purpose of the tax since the most wealthy in this country tend to have majority share in one successful company

I would posit that this tax would probably only be on publicly traded companies, but then that has it’s own problems, deincentivizing comapnies from going public and more investor turning to the private sector

Tax,comment,l34i24c,Steve12356d1s3d4,,"You buy land for 50K, and then find oil making the land worth $10 million. You sell the oil every year and make hundreds of thousands. Those hundreds of thousands are taxed. That 10 million is not taxed until you sell it. The $10 million hasn't been made yet. If you sell it, you are selling the right to the future income to someone else. You *then* realize the value. At that point, oil may be worth less, so the land will be worth less than the 10 million, say 5 million. You never had 10 million, you had something that was estimated to be worth 10 million but was actually only worth 5 million when you sold it.  You get taxed at the 4.95 million when you sell it, and the oil income is then taxed by the company that bought the land. They paid 5 million for the land, and that 5 million will be deducted over time to lower the income when they make it or reduce the gain when sold. The sale itself in a way is taxing future revenue, because the 5 million is taxed now, but deducted later to reduce future taxes by the company when the income is actually made. You needed the sale to trigger this, as before the sale, there nothing to tax (except the year-to-year income).  In this way cap gains, at least partly taxes future estimated income as a matter of course. In the long run, the money is taxed either way if it is made. Here it is about timing. If you had set up a corp when you bought the land, the hundreds of thousands you made per year before you sold it will be taxed at 21%, and then you would be taxed again when the company paid you the earning as dividends at 15%. So it would be double taxed (If one is upper income the total tax for investment income is (23.8%). If the corp kept the money and did not pay dividends, they still would pay 21% tax on the income, but the cash in the bank account would increase the value of the company, and when you sold the company, the value would then be taxed to you as cap gains, so it is still double taxed. This is what happens often in growth companies. This delays the double taxation, but the income is still taxed every year at 21% when earned.

The tax burden is on the year-to-year income of the company by whoever owns it, no matter what.  By selling, you are getting taxed on the increase in value from when it was bought. The increase is value is based on what will be made in the future, but the current income will still be taxed by the corp every year.",2024-05-08T13:02:47+00:00

Bitcoin's value went up, but that is just because some people thought it was worth a certain amount. Those people were often wrong.

Tax,comment,l36vwak,Steve12356d1s3d4,,"I am going to repeat myself, but the main reason is that, as shown in my example, the valuation is based on income that hasn't been made yet, and the income is taxed when it *is* actually earned. This ""inequality"" is based on paper valuations and is not even spent until it is taken out and taxed.  In my example, the hundreds of thousands in income per year is taxed, but the 10 million is not.  It shouldn't be, it will be taxed when it is realized, and that is the best time to tax it. Why tax 10 million when in this case it ended up being only 5 million in valuation. It was just speculation to call it 10 million at that point. It is paper gains.

I don't think the double taxation issue a reason that we should not tax unrealized gains, so I won't address it here. I just pointed it out mainly to show that even if the unrealized gains are not taxed, the actual income is.

The US has one of the highest median incomes in the world. We do benefit from our system. We had one of the best recoveries from COVID and other downturns. Our high-tech companies was always given as an example as a major reason why. This leads to high paying jobs, spending by these companies that goes to other companies and people, and they pay income tax on their earnings.

Put another way, the valuation is speculative, sometimes markets are inflated. Valuations go up and down.  There is not even a reason to tax it, as income is taxed when earned. Taxing these valuations is trying to fix a problem that doesn't exist, as actual earnings are taxed. There is nothing we are missing out on. Looking at a person's wealth based on these valuations is looking at a number on a computer and will be taxed when it is realized. There is no current financial benefit to the person owning unless  taxable transaction is made, such as dividends. So, you are asking to tax a person before he even has *financial* benefit from ownership.

For federal, I’m expecting to get a bunch of money back.

State tax is Oregon.  I am probably going to owe them a ton of money because, due to my moving states and my company having a hard time changing my location in their system, I paid taxes to Michigan for the majority of the year, despite living in Oregon for the entire calendar year.  I’m expecting the money back from Michigan, which is basically just going to change hands and go to Oregon.

Hopefully in my favor, the accountant told me how much I was likely to owe to Oregon, and I paid that before the tax deadline to avoid any penalty.  So Oregon just got a chunk of money from me with no paperwork to accompany it.

TLDR:
I didn’t file/pay federal, but they owe me money.

We are in our fourth year, but trying to get an updated letter which we’ve used in the past (charity contact name has some turnover) and the people in charge at the charity asked if we turn over 100% of the funds raised for the event to them. 

For the first two years, we did give them basically everything we ended up with after all expenses were paid, but in the third year, we held a few thousand dollars back to help us get a headstart on this year, and maybe some other small sponsorships for other charities similar causes. 

Note this is only for larger businesses giving us donations of $500 and more that we provide this letter, not for every golfer that signs up, buys raffle tickets, etc.   

Is there an issue if we truly do not give every penny to this one charity we are looking for a letter from?  Any thoughts on how we can proceed with this? We really don’t want to lose the business sponsors as that’s what helps keep this going year to year, but we also want to find ways to give back in another way without having to register ourselves as a charity.

It's perfectly normal that charities have to use some of the donations they receive to cover their own operating costs, so the IRS rule isn't that donations given to charity must be used exclusively for charitable work.

There is a broker statement that looks like it shows sales of the partnership but of course it doesn't show the same number of units sold as the other pages in the k-1.

Currently waiting for HR to reach out to our insurance provider to see if the insurance plan we already offer would be classified as an HDHP were it not for the HRA that is offered alongside it, so I'll hold any talk of changing providers or whatnot until after they've heard back. I believe the plan we offer *is* an HDHP based on IRS publication 969's HDHP criteria (deductible<$1,650, out-of-pocket<$8,050, and not covering anything aside from preventative care before deductible is met) but the plan documents don't explicitly mention being an HDHP, so they have to check with the provider to clarify.


My current hope is that the insurance plan we already offer is an HDHP, so that way all I'd have to do is suspend my participation in the HRA and open an HSA for myself. I would still be subject to FICA taxes that way since contributions wouldn't be coming directly by my employer making deductions from my paycheck, but I would at least avoid federal and state income taxes and it wouldn't require any real change to accomplish, and would therefore be an extremely easy process.


Even in that case, I'd definitely advocate for us to start offering HSA contributions as well, since being exempt from FICA taxes on those would be great for both employees and the employer, but if that would require that we switch to an entirely different insurance provider, it would be a difficult sell, because when I asked HR about HDHP/HSA stuff today, they actually told me no one else had ever asked before me. (I assume meaning most people in the company are content with the current plan).


This is all theoretical though until HR hears back from the provider about whether our current plan (minus the HRA) is already an HDHP.",2024-05-07T00:46:55+00:00
Tax,post,1clqn2r,SecretDeparture6063,S-corp Single owner (2% shareholder) - health insurance via employee deduction or company contribution?,"Hi All!

I have a new S-corp and am setting up gusto for my payroll; I want to add a third party health insurance through gusto, which I've been paying through a personal account previously (I am receiving no benefits otherwise). Gusto promps me for health insurance via employee deduction or company distribution. So far from what I've read, it may be better tax-wise for me to pay my health insurance as a employee deduction (through paying the employee (me) monthly with payroll), rather than to pay the health insurance through my business account as an S-corp shareholder (subject to federal tax). What's recommended here?

**All** taxpayers must **pay** tax in timely installments (at least quarterly), and this has nothing to do with having a business.

But interest, capital gains, rental income, etc. are all other types of income on which you are responsible for the payment.

If your total tax (after subtracting any withholding payments) is less than $1,000 then you are exempt from the requirement for timely payment.  Also, the required minimum payment may be figured multiple ways, one of which is based on your prior-year tax.

Tax,post,1cloujf,flectric,W-8BEN for a contractor in Spain? Do I need to withhold 30% of their income?,"Hello - 

  
I'm a bit confused about Form W-8BEN and the process of contracting an independent contractor in Spain. I own a single-member LLC in the US. I understand that they will need to fill out W-8BEN, but is it on them to apply for the ITIN and foreign tax identifying number first? Does this form ***exempt*** them from the 30% tax, or am I supposed to withhold 30% from every invoice that they send me?

What else am I missing about contracting someone internationally? Will this still be categorized as contract labor on my schedule C?

I expressed concern to them from the start about getting these specific W2 forms form previous employers and they told me to try anyway which I did. For reference one company is long closed down and the other is a family run business I left on bad terms and they are throwing up roadblocks to get the actual W2 forms.

I reached out to my tax professional for advice on what to do next and if reaching out to the IRS should be my next step in order to get these W2 forms and they are now suggesting I file without the state information on my W2 and have prepared said returns for my review.

However I'm wondering if I have truly exhausted all my avenues for getting this W2 I have reached out to payroll companies and had no luck. I wanted to give some context but my question essentially is

Is filing without my state information (I'm in PA) really the best course of action in this situation? If not is there any way I can get the W2 forms or the state withholding information from a valid source my tax pro can use? I imagine without this filled in I will have to repay all the state taxes and I would rather not. Thanks for any and all help!",2024-05-06T17:15:34+00:00

I compared both my paychecks from my old agency to new, and it seems as though they are taking out a lot more in federal tax withholding, around $700 vs my last paycheck which was $400 federal withholding. So they were withholding 11% and now are withholding almost 17%. Is this correct? I emailed my agency’s payroll department but they are taking a while to respond.

I used the IRS Withholding Estimator and it stated they are withholding too much and I will get a big tax refund. I want to break-even (or close to). Before the W4 was changed in 202, I always claimed 0. 

The tool for the IRS Withholding Estimator created a pre-filled W4 to send to my employer, but it filled in a number for box 4a and 4c which I don’t believe is correct. See picture. I don’t have other income besides my current job and I don’t want extra witholding… I want more money upfront in my paycheck. This used to be so much easier before they changed the form in 2020.

Tax,comment,l2tzomq,Its-a-write-off,,What kind of expenses? Are the expenses of being an owner or expenses of the work they do as an employee of the business?,2024-05-06T14:16:16+00:00
Tax,comment,l2ukive,Hot-Ic,,"First of all, your explanation makes little sense, as it appears that the business partners do not have reasonable business policies.

From the looks, it appears that business partners do not agree to cover some of the expenses incurred by your husband, while your husband wants to treat them as ""tax deductible"". As such, this type of arrangement is not due to ""strict finance guidelines"" and it is not a tax question really, as this is not how the business enterprises work. As such there are serious flaws in your own question.

However, strictly speaking in accounting terms, such expenses can be reimbursed (assuming these are legitimate business expenses) as a way of accounting them as business deductible expenses.  There are several ways of doing it. I will give one example:

1. Your husband can create another sole propietorship and obtain EIN number. It costs nothing, and it could be filed on schedule C.

2. You can direct your money making enterprise to issue earnings to this newly create EIN. On your own tax return on this schedule C now you can deduct business expenses and assistants. If you hired assistant, then you will be responsible to issuing w-2 or 1099, and it will now be your burden to provide the evidence that these expenses are business related (and not ""finance partner's"").",2024-05-06T16:21:17+00:00

Donated goods (your question) are often tax deductible at a fair market value but catering (your example) isn't a good but a service so I'm not sure whether the IRS would consider that tax deductible.

But the interpretation of tax laws shouldn't be the nonprofit's responsibility. What our organization used to do is just issue a letter detailing what was received and thanking the donor for their contribution, and let the donor decide, with their own tax attorney/accountant/CPA, whether to tax-deduct their donation. That way the responsibility of deciding whether something is or isn't tax deductible is in the hands of the professionals, and they have something to use as the proof of the donation if they needed one, but we weren't on the hook for doing that work ourselves that's not in our area of expertise.",2024-05-06T18:34:11+00:00

Tax,post,1cli53d,taterares,I’m newly on 1099 - spouse is on w2. So many questions. ,"This month I got a 1099 job offer while I was working a w2 position that I hated. I accepted it, without truly looking into what to expect for taxes.

My spouse makes about 45K/Yearly.

Tax,comment,l2u2xc3,YouKnowHowChoicesBe,,"If you took on a 1099 job, that means you are now a small business owner. The business that ""hired"" you is not taking taxes out for you because they are paying you as an independent contractor, so you have to set aside both income tax (variable based on your household income) and self employment tax (15.3%) from your profit. This saves the business hiring you a ton of money...but they can't just ""choose"" to make you a contractor, otherwise every business would probably do that. You either are or you aren't. Use this [IRS Guide](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee) for determining if you should really be classified as a contractor or not. Businesses misclassify people all the time to attempt to save money.

Contractors typically charge a higher rate for work because of all the added taxes and small business expenses.  For example, at a W2 job, my pay rate is around $38 an hour. But if I were to go out on my own, as a small biz, I would charge probably $60-70 an hour.

The simple facts that you were hired at X rate (instead of you giving them *your* rates) and the fact that you seem to have a set schedule (contractors can typically work when, where, and how they want) gives me hints that they are possibly misclassifying you and you should be an employee.",2024-05-06T14:36:25+00:00

Tax,comment,l2tsb2p,Kiarimarie,,"The biggest thing about being a 1099 independent contractor that people mess up is that no taxes are taken out pay.

You have two options to make sure you pay enough taxes:

1. have your wife increase her W-2 withholdings
2. pay quarterly (I suggest using the IRS online payment system but you can mail in checks with a voucher still, I believe)

Since your wife makes $47k, I'd say you should at least be putting aside ~~38%~~  28% of your paycheck for federal taxes. This will account for the ~~22%~~ 12% income tax (letting your wife's income ""eat up"" some lower brackets) and the 15.3% self employment tax (FICA taxes, but the employee and employer portion).

State and local taxes will also need to be considered.

The upside to 1099 contract work is that you get to deduct relevant expenses from your pay. This can be daunting and it might be worth seeing a CPA or EA to discuss this even before tax season so you can track relevant  expenses and not stress over ones that would not be deductible.",2024-05-06T13:27:22+00:00

Tax,comment,l2uvbld,Ill-Rain-9811,,"If you are looking to keep it simple, Sarah has it right. Aim for putting aside 30% which should be enough for federal and state (if applicable). Our household is similar. One W2 and one multi-1099. When we were younger (1990s) we put aside 25%, and that was enough. Then needed 30% for many years. Lately we've needed 35%. Even so, taxes each year can be all over the place for 1099/Sch C returns. Even when you get it right, the tax code shifts. A bunch of Trump era tax breaks are about to expire. And those same reforms made the standard deduction much higher.

Keep in mind that business expenses are different than personal deductions. So even if you take the standard deduction (most do) you will still want to track business expenses as they can help lower your tax bill. 

You can also have your wife have more taken out on her end (if you guys file jointly) which helps a lot with the variances year to year. 

Some years we get it perfect and owe very little. Some years we owe a lot, this past year we got a large refund.

The key is to pay estimated taxes every quarter (we all used to be able to pay it all at once in Jan, but the IRS now penalizes per quarter) that either matches 100%/110% of what you owed last year or 90% of what you owe for the current year. This can be hard to calculate ahead of time with both a W2 earner and a 1099 earner. Much easier to figure out if you file separately. 

Be sure you start keeping receipts for all business expenses that you are not reimbursed for by the real estate company, including your home expenses if you have a home office...you should have one. Track your home spending...if you have a home office you can deduct a small portion of you bills, including cell phone, Internet, and utilities (you will have to figure how much is for business/your home office.)

This will get confusing, but Google a bit on QBR, which you may be entitled to if you file as a business (Sch C). It's a really nice credit if you qualify. 

This all sounds overly complicated, but it's not that bad. You can do your taxes yourself with tax software/apps. We have always done our own. But many recommend an accountant or tax pro for a Sch C return.

You will have to put at least 15.3% aside regardless of how much you make. Period. That's SE tax and it starts earning $400 of income as an independent contractor. 

If you want a more accurate picture of your federal, then you and your wife will earn $73k roughly it sounds like. Take the standard deduction off that ($29,200) and you have $44k roughly of federal taxable income. So your wife's withholdings for the year need to be at least $4.8k, plus the $4k of self employment tax (so $8k), for you not to have to pay in anything to the IRS. 

I will amend my prior comment that your marginal is likely 12%, not 22% (accidentally was looking at single taxpayers) so it 28% is probably plenty for federal purposes. But again, that doesn't take into account any state or local tax obligations.",2024-05-06T14:05:44+00:00

just put 15% of your 1099 pay to side in a high yield checking account. once a quarter you are responsible for paying estimated taxes.


you will not ""owe"" 8000 at the end of the year because you are going to be paying quarterly and then using deductions to off-set your actual business expenses.

My ex decided to keep the coins off of the estate papers for the purpose of avoiding taxes down the line. Yes, I know that it’s illegal and not the right way to do things but it was not my decision to make. My ex did sell some coins for cash but it was a very large collection so I’m not sure what they expect to do with the rest of the collection. It’s not my problem to worry about (right??) now that we are divorced. 

I want to sell the coins. I have no way of proving what the coins were worth at the time of death or the time of when they were given to me. Im worried that if I get audited I wouldn’t be able to prove the cost basis. Do I have to consider the cost basis as $0 and consider them as 100% capital gain? ",2024-05-06T06:48:14+00:00

I am returning to college in a few months and will be able to finish my degree within a year. This is great, however it will leave me with some excess money in my 529 plan. I know general advice is to name a different beneficiary like a child or save it for a master's degree, however I don't plan to do any of that. My plan is also in Utah which does not recognize the Roth IRA rollover, which I would take advantage of.

My question is that since the SECURE act allows you to pay $10,000 in student loans using a 529 plan (which Utah does recognize), could I theoretically take out $10,000 in excess student loans, pay it back using my 529, and essentially have been able to withdraw $10,000 tax free from my 529?

**#1 Taxable income**

***Defined by IRS website:***

>Most income is taxable unless it’s specifically exempted by law. Income can be money, property, goods or services. Even if you don’t receive a form reporting income, you should report it on your tax return.

>Income is taxable when you receive it, even if you don’t cash it or use it right away. It’s considered your income even if it’s paid to someone else on your behalf.

[https://www.irs.gov/filing/taxable-income](https://www.irs.gov/filing/taxable-income)

It lists income from employment, SE/gig income, business, investments, and other.

**#2 VS. Taxable Income**

***On Form 1040, line 15*** (based on tax return filed 2024)

* It says line 15 is your taxable income.
* This is the amount that is reduced from gross income. Reduced by things like traditional 401k, standard deductions. It can be $0.
* It usually reduces unless the starting income is $0 and taxable income is $0 also.
* This is the number used to calculate taxes.

**According to** [**investopedia.com**](http://investopedia.com)**, taxable income is**

>the portion of your gross income on which you are required to pay income taxes

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableincome.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableincome.asp)

**For example,**

If you have W2 wages of $10,000, that would be considered taxable income since it's wages from an employer. However, after taking the standard deduction, your taxable income becomes $0 on line 15 meaning taxes get applied to the $0 amount which results in no tax liability for federal income taxes. So you would have at the same time taxable income but no taxable income.",2024-05-06T05:45:21+00:00

Tax,post,1cla9gu,Dry-Specialist-3557,Dependent and Filing Status Question,"Can my friend claim her biological daughter from a father she never married as a dependent on her 2022 taxes?

Also, should she file single or as Head of Household.

Her daughter was born August 8, 2003 and became a Student (Full-Time???) at the Aveda Cosmetology schools starting October 2022.  Clearly on December 31, 2022 the daughter would have been 19 years 4 months and several days old.

My take on it is that Aveda Cosmetology school makes her daughter a full-time student because she was pursuing a license with a 1500+ hour course, but being in school starting in October she doesn't meet the 5 month requirement, so she was NOT a qualifying child???  She is not disabled.

Is this correct that she is therefore NOT a qualifying dependent?  Being she has no other children, would her filing status be Head of Household or Single?

Can she claim her daughter as a dependent?  Is there such thing as a non-qualifying dependent?  Is dependency and Head of Household filing status mutually exclusive in that you can have one but not the other???",2024-05-06T04:17:30+00:00

I haven't filed taxes for the last 10 years and am trying to get caught up. I haven't earned much money and for half that time I was overseas. I think the most money earned was 30K one year, and between 10k-20k the rest of the years. I want to get right with the taxes, so I will go see my accountant to help back file. But I'd like to have an idea of what I'm doing, so a few questions maybe someone can help with:

1.) How many years should I back file for? 

2.) Someone told me I might be able to partially offset some of the penalties I owe with Covid payments I never received. My accountant says he knows nothing about that, so I'm guessing these payments are handled separately? How would I go about applying for the Covid payments to be applied towards my debts? I think the ability to apply for them expires in about a week.

3.) I have had people send me payments on PayPal, but I have a personal account, not a business one, so I don't have the tax form that is usually sent to business accounts. This is the same issue I have with money sent to my personal bank account. I basically have to go through line by line for years and figure out what I was paid for work. Should I just over estimate? I'm afraid if I miss some and underreport it'll cause a problem. I'm not even sure if my bank has monthly statements going back that far readily available online. Altogether, this would likely be 10-15k per year tops.

4.) The money sent to my account (bank and PayPal) was often sent from people living overseas, and I was overseas for many of the years they sent it. Would this be considered foreign income? 

5.) This is a weird question, but my accountant often asks how many bags of clothes I donated. There is a charity bin our community puts clothes into that is collected for the less fortunate, but I don't get any receipts for that. It's very much like a recycling bin, only for donated clothes. Should I just say 0? 

6.) My accountant asked me if I got a letter from the IRS. As far as I know I didn't, but now I'm worried that maybe I'm wanted for tax evasion or something. I'm going to see him this week. Is there any chance I'll be arrested for back taxes? Last thing I need is to put myself on their radar and wind up with prison time.

COVID stimulus payments were refundable credits for tax years 2020 and 2021. The way you would apply for those is to file your 2020 and 2021 taxes. The deadline to file and still be able to receive a refund for 2020 is May 17th - so yeah time is of the essence there.

You should, to the best of your ability, reconstruct what you made. If you were self-employed (which it sounds like you may have been) you should do your best to reconstruct what your ordinary and necessary business expenses were.

Start with the records that you have. Extrapolate what you're able to accurately extrapolate.

**It's odd that they're even asking.** Charitable contributions only come into play if you itemize your deductions (which you probably won't) and yes you need receipts.

**This question they're asking about donated clothes, along with their lack of knowledge about the COVID credits, is** ***extremely*** **concerning.**

Filing back taxes shows that you're not purposely hiding from the IRS. If anything it would take you off their radar for criminal prosecution.

There's a very real likelihood that you'll owe some taxes and some penalties and some interest. The penalty for non/late filing is TEN TIMES the penalty for non/late payment. Even if you're completely unable to pay, filing helps slow the bleeding so to speak.",2024-05-06T02:07:37+00:00
Tax,comment,l2s14ao,foxfirek,,"1) You should evaluate which years you had a filing requirement. many years you probably did not. Technically you should file all years you had a filing requirement. It's unlikely the IRS will audit you more then 6 years back- but if you did not file they can and the statute of limitations never runs out. By being late you have forfeited all refunds more then 3 years old. Tax is still due if it was. You probably owe no tax for the years overseas but need to file the foreign earned income tax exclusion each year. If you had an FBAR filing requirement (had 10k in a foreign bank account in any one year) then you are fucked. I cant tell you not to file and to hope they dont catch you- but well the risk is low and the penalty for failure to file an FBAR is 10k per year. 

2) Umm- they told you in kind of a weird way but maybe. There were some refundable tax credit in 2020 called the economic impact payment for about $1,200 to low income people during the pandemic- only the last 3 years of refunds are still eligible, so 2020 is too late, 2021 there may have been a smaller one. You just file and if you are eligible you would have a higher refund that year. 

3) You need to keep good records when you run a business- you will need to estimate to the best of your ability, both income and expenses. 

4) US residents are taxed on worldwide income. Where you are physically present usually determines if your income is foreign sourced or US sourced. As you were overseas it was foreign. You clearly were low income so you will want to take the foreign earned income exclusion. 

5) Just say 0- if you have no receipt the IRS would throw it out. 

6) You wont be arrested- they would garnish your wages or bank account. 75% chance they have not contacted you.",2024-05-06T02:48:00+00:00

as others have said, first you need a tax attorney who deals with offshore, and you need to submit to programs for offshore disclosures especially the FBAR stuff even explaining the situation of you not doing jack is better then trying to not file back FBAR's.

Unless your banks were still in the US than you should be fine, for the others years just do your taxes like normally, you have massive foreign earned income credits so most likely you wouldn't owe anything.

Tax,comment,l2rvijt,KJ6BWB,,"> How many years should I back file for?

Go sign up for an IRS account with ID.me at irs.gov/account -- then pull your wage and income transcript for the years in question. Compare it with the filing requirement for those year. If you didn't need to file for a year then don't bother filing. May 17, 2024 is the final date to file a 2020 return for a refund. So if you didn't have a balance due in a year then don't bother filing as you can't get that money anyway. Go as far back as you need to when you both had to file and also had a balance due.

> Someone told me I might be able to partially offset some of the penalties I owe with Covid payments I never received.

Sure. Call (844) 545-5640 and ask the IRS whether it shows you received the stimulus checks. The deadline to file a 2020 return for those is May 17, 2024 so get on it. 

> I basically have to go through line by line for years and figure out what I was paid for work

See what your wage and income transcript says then start figuring it out from there.

> The money sent to my account (bank and PayPal) was often sent from people living overseas, and I was overseas for many of the years they sent it. Would this be considered foreign income?

Did you pay income tax on it in a foreign country? Did you have a foreign bank account? In any case, yes it will count as foreign income.

> There is a charity bin our community puts clothes into that is collected for the less fortunate, but I don't get any receipts for that

Since 2018, the standard deduction is likely high enough that there's not really a point in trying to itemize so you can get a deduction for a charitable contribution. If you want to claim more than $250 of charitable contributions then you'll need receipts. The charity bin probably doesn't give receipts.

> My accountant asked me if I got a letter from the IRS. As far as I know I didn't, but now I'm worried that maybe I'm wanted for tax evasion or something.

You probably aren't. Call that number I gave earlier, ask the IRS. You'll likely be on hold 3-15 minutes. They'll also be able to tell you if they filed a SFR (substitute for your missing return) for you. SFR's don't contain extra credits like a credit for foreign-owed taxes or the child tax credit, but you probably didn't take those anyway?

Tax,comment,l2s0a27,adrade,,"If you lived overseas, you may be eligible for the streamlined foreign offshore procedures. If you are, this is the way to do it. Do not simply submit your back taxes in quietly; I feel like this is rarely the right path. Look first to see if you’re eligible for streamlined procedures, and if so, do that.

With streamlined foreign offshore procedures, you will have to have lived away from the US for at least one of the past three years and you are only required to file those past three years without penalties at all and you’re considered brought back up to date. You have to file a declaration saying the lack of filing was non-willful and that you promise to always file properly in the future. This is a pretty straightforward process. Streamlined is a normal process that thousands of people do every year. Without streamlined, you will be looking at penalties, but with it, you only go back three years, and there are no penalties (only interest).

(Also, this subreddit is FULL of people who need this all to be wildly complicated for their jobs to exist, so take a deep breath, sort through the fear mongering and fluff, and know you’ll be just fine.

Above the NY AMT threshold of $107,650, the numbers get progressively more wrong the higher AGI I enter.

The scary part is, all 3 calculators give very similar wrong numbers:

At $1,000,000, 1 & 2 both return $65,552, and #3 returns $66,306.

********

So, are my formulae off?

Or is it reasonable to assume that whoever wrote these online calculators were lazy about AMT calculations?

The ordinary income would be split between the 10 and 12% brackets, the long term gains would be split between 0 and 15% brackets.",2024-05-05T20:08:38+00:00

Or do you calculate the rate starting at $31k baseline of the ordinary income? So if the %15 tax bracket started at $40k, the first $9k would be 0% and the rest 15%?

And the ordinary income bracket isnt affected by the capital gains income?",2024-05-05T20:16:47+00:00

Put in my two weeks with a reputable home restoration company to install panels and sell d2d in my downtime.

The catch with the solar company is that I’ll be purely 1099 as an installer and as a rep. I’ve heard, however, that it’s illegal to be 1099 and be provided a set schedule with jobs to complete.

The solar company would be providing me with work and tools, as well as a company truck.

Should I still take the solar opportunity or keep my legal 9-5?

The new company has said they're not going to bother with figuring out who is hitting the FICA limit based on my YTD payroll with the old company and adjusting accordingly in their system once I onboard, so for the last few months of the year, I'll be getting FICA withheld when I really shouldn't be.

If you can get an appointment at a Taxpayer Assistance Center by 5/17, I recommend you file it in person.

If you can't get to a TAC, make sure the return is perfect -- no missing attachments, signed and dated in blue ink -- and make sure you have the correct IRS mailing address.

Even if you had been able to successfully direct deposit part of your refund into your TreasuryDirect account, it would have gone into the Zero Percent Certificate of Indebtedness (C-of-I) which is like the default holding place for cash in a TreasuryDirect account.

Tax,post,1cksobp,bumbah,Updated W4 and withholdings -- paycheck changed dramatically,"I've been forever chasing the golden balance of not owing/no refund. It seems impossible and I can't help but feel that something is amiss.

For the past 5 years, every tax filing, we've had to pay in anywhere from 1500 - 3500 on average. Yes, our W4s are updated --married filing jointly, multiple jobs/spouse works, 0 Allowances/dependent amount; extra withholding \~150.00 apiece. We each have one W2 and no additional income (no gambling, no crypto, no estate, nothing). We have 2 kids - we get child tax credits, dependent care credit. etc. Standard Deduction applied.

We paid in nearly 2500 this year in Federal taxes and we immediately updated our W4 to withhold an additional \~$40 per month apiece ( I get paid twice monthly, wife gets paid every two weeks). So my withholding went up from 130 to 170 paycheck.

Oddly enough, my next paycheck was 290 less. Are changes to W4 cumulative i.e 130 +170 = 300? Or did they withhold extra to account for the past paychecks? $40x7weeks = 280?

We pay in so much each year, withhold a crap ton, have a very a simple income scenario. Why is this so challenging to balance our taxes????

  
Thanks to those who chimed in! Sorry to those whom I offended and downvoted me. Life is rough, i totally get it",2024-05-05T14:36:35+00:00
Tax,comment,l2p9d2z,clobber88,,"No the W4 is not cumulative and no they did not (should not) have withheld to account for past pay checks. I would first check to make sure your withholding are correct and agree with how you filled out your W4. You can do that using a paycheck calculator like the one here: [https://www.yourmoneypage.com/withhold/fedwh1.php](https://www.yourmoneypage.com/withhold/fedwh1.php)

Assuming both of your withholding are correct based on how you filled out the W4, here is my suggestion:



1) Figure out what your total tax liability for 2024 will be. There are several ways to do that:

a) If you filed 2023 using turbotax, use the What-If worksheet in the forms section

b) Use a Tax calculator like [https://www.dinkytown.net/java/1040-tax-calculator.html](https://www.dinkytown.net/java/1040-tax-calculator.html) or [https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calcs/1040-calculator.php](https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calcs/1040-calculator.php) or [https://www.irscalculators.com/tax-calculator](https://www.irscalculators.com/tax-calculator)

2) You can use your pay statements and/or a pay check calculator to determine what your total withholdings will be at the end of the year. The pay statements and calculator make this very easy.

3) If your expected withholding is close to your expected tax liability, you are all good. If not, adjust your W4. Use the pay check calculator to determine how much.

1. Based on your inputs, the IRS tool calculates that your total income for 2024 will be $150,000 including salaries, interest, dividends, capital gains, etc. 

2. Based on your inputs and total income of $150,000, we have calculated that your taxable income will be $120,000 using the standard deduction and child tax credits.

3. Based on your inputs and taxable income of $120,000, we have calculated that your 2024 tax liability will be $10,500 using the MFJ filing status.

4. Based on your inputs, you are on schedule to withhold $8,000 or $2,500  less than you should.

5. The action you you need to take is to have an extra $2,500 withheld over the remaining pay periods you have left. You can do this by submitting a new W-4 with box 4(c) set to $200.

This would allow the taxpayer to examine each number to see if it makes sense. If you look through this sub, you will see numerous people getting crazy numbers from the tool - and they are clearly incorrect. 

To their credit, the IRS tool (and the W-4) is trying to make things easy by not using salary information. After all, if you only have a salary then a blank W-4 will withhold the right amount. The W-4 is only really needed to make adjustments for external income, tax credits, deductions etc. However, trying to make it simple has made things difficult to understand and verify.

I purchased a house around 20 years ago. The house came as-is and was basically furnished; meaning, the previous owner down-sized into a condo and just left with a few personal things. In reality, there was too much stuff and I needed to dispose of a lot of items (donated/destroyed), which I did.

I did keep some of the more interesting/better items.

It turns out that one antique item left in the house has significant value, e.g. \~30k USD. I plan on having this item auctioned off (because now I am downsizing myself).

It's not as if when you bought the house there was an itemized list of everything the previous owner left behind, and you factored those individual contents into your offer price. If anything, an as-is sale typically represents a liability relative to market value, since the burden falls on the buyer to then dispose of all the junk left behind, which is exactly what you describe.

It's hard to give more specific guidance in the absence of actual numbers here (purchase price, comparable market values for similar properties at the time, etc.) but if I were advising you I'd recommend just going with a basis of <$100 as the only clearly defensible approach.",2024-05-05T14:09:06+00:00

Ok. It will have to reported on your taxes. No big deal as long as you're under the lifetime limit for it to be taxable.

No need to open a joint account just to transfer funds. Wire, ACH, or Cashier's check is easy peasy.

* Earned income: $7000
* FICA taxes: $535.50 (7.65% of $7000)
* Income taxes withheld = $700
* Take home pay = $5764.50

**What is the max I can contribute to a Roth IRA? and can I use money from something like a savings account to make up the difference if my take home pay is not enough to contribute the max?**



**#2**

**Can I contribute to a Roth IRA if my standard deduction reduces my taxable income to $0?**

I'm getting confused here since when I google ""taxable compensation"", ""taxable income"" pops up. If my taxable income is $0, how can I contribute to Roth IRA?

**Is taxable compensation the same as taxable income? Or is it different?**

**Is the taxable compensation $7000, while the taxable income $0?**



**#4**

* Tax Year = 2024
* Status/Age = single, less than 50
* Earned Income = $24,905.25
* FICA taxes = $1,905.25  (24,905.25 \* 7.65%)

Is this possible?

* 401k contribution = $23,000
* Roth IRA contribution = $7000

So in Scenario 1, you can contribute $7,000 to your IRA assuming you have the $535.50 to replace what was withheld for FICA. The$700 of income tax withheld is not a factor as that'll be refunded, given that you have no tax liability.

This right here is the best case scenario. Putting away money without paying tax on it and then withdrawing it in retirement without paying tax on it is the best tax advantage anyone could possibly get.

In Scenario 2, if it's a traditional 401(k) then those contributions are removed from your Box 1 earnings so you have only $1,905.25 of AGI available. If it's a Roth 401(k), then I believe you could double dip, if you had the extra funds available somewhere else.",2024-05-05T12:24:38+00:00

Tax,post,1ckmt1a,Snoo_75434,Acquiring a business and accelerating depreciation,"Hello, I'm not a tax professional. I'm a software engineer with a W2 job. I'm looking for ways to defer some taxes and acquire some assets. My income is over 400k a year. I have about 20 rentals today. But, my understanding is passive losses can't offset none of my active income.

So, I'm exploring buying business with low touch where I can meet the material participation requirement like short term rentals, car washes, ATM routes, car rentals, etc.

But, I'm not sure if I understand how bonus depreciation works for businesses like an ATM route. These businesses usually trade a 2 years worth of cashflow. But, they don't really have a whole lot of equipment. I see routes with 35 machines (prolly worth 70-90k worth of machines) selling for 200k due to their cashflow. Can I still bonus depreciate 60% of 200k in Y1? or can I only accelerate 60% of the actual value of the machines, 70-90k?

What happens with a 1M car wash? My understanding is that a car wash is a special use building and meets the 15 year requirement to accelerate depreciation. Would I be able to accelerate 60% of the 1M purchase price - value of land?

Are these questions better asked to a CPA or a real estate attorney? I obviously don't want to commit tax fraud or take on more than I can chew. I'm just looking for a way to acquire assets and defer some of my taxes away. I'm not looking for a super active business, I'm looking for something light but that I can still meet the material participation requirement.",2024-05-05T08:43:17+00:00

1. **ATM Routes**: Bonus depreciation allows you to accelerate the depreciation of certain assets, typically tangible property with a recovery period of 20 years or less. While the machines themselves may not have a significant value compared to the overall purchase price of the route, you can still apply bonus depreciation to the entire purchase price of the route, including the cash flow generated. However, you'll need to allocate the purchase price between tangible assets (like the machines) and intangible assets (like the cash flow stream) to determine the eligible amount for bonus depreciation.
2. **Car Washes**: You're correct that car wash buildings typically qualify for accelerated depreciation due to their classification as special use property with a recovery period of 15 years. In the case of a $1M car wash purchase, you can apply bonus depreciation to the entire purchase price, excluding the value of the land. This allows you to accelerate depreciation on the building portion of the purchase price, providing tax benefits in the first year.

Just be aware of depreciation recapture if you end up selling the assets later on for a profit, or any sort of value.",2024-05-05T22:34:48+00:00

I’ll add a photo since it’s easier to explain: so this is the math I’ve been given for this $83.25 is what I made hourly and $149.02 is what I owe for taxes, I subtract that and I get $65.77 so then I pay $67 and I get the check of $1.23.

See Topic 761: [https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc761](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc761) for employers, with my emphasis added here:

>You collect the employee's portion of these taxes from the wages you pay your employee, ***or from funds the employee gives you***. If you don't have enough money from the employee's wages and funds your employee gives you, withhold taxes in the following order:  
...  
Withhold any remaining unpaid federal income taxes from the employee's next paycheck, up to the close of the calendar year. However, ***if you can't collect all of the employee's Social Security and Medicare taxes on tips*** by the 10th day of the month following the month in which your employee reported the tips, ***you don't have to collect these taxes***.

So they could just see they don't have enough money to cover your tax withholding requirements, shrug their shoulders, and then screw you over at the end of the year. 

See, you still owe the tax whether they've withheld it or not. If your employer can't withhold enough from your non-tip wages to cover all the taxes you owe, you'll have to pay that full amount when you file your tax return, and when you do that you also owe penalties and interest. You're supposed to withhold during the year and if you don't do it you're responsible for the penalties. 

Instead, your employer is doing kindness. They're asking that you pay them what's needed to cover all the taxes, so at the end of the year you get a normal W-2 that shows normal payroll withholding.",2024-05-05T12:09:11+00:00

From the IRS:

# Q1. Could my income level prevent me from taking the New Clean Vehicle Credit? (updated Oct. 6, 2023)

A1. Yes. You may not claim the credit if your modified adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds certain thresholds. This limitation is based on the lesser of your modified AGI for the year that the new clean vehicle was placed in service or for the preceding year. The relevant modified AGI thresholds are as follows:

* Married filing jointly or filing as a qualifying surviving spouse or a qualifying widow(er) - $300,000
* Head of household - $225,000
* All other taxpayers - $150,000

Your modified AGI is the amount from line 11 of your Form 1040 plus:

* Any amount on line 45 or line 50 of Form 2555, Foreign Earned Income.
* Any amount excluded from gross income because it was received from sources in Puerto Rico or American Samoa.

If your filing status changes between the preceding year and the current year, you may claim the New Clean Vehicle Credit if your modified AGI is less than or equal to the threshold applicable to your filing status for in the preceding year or current year.

Then a realtor submits a tax return showing three houses sold, but claims three computers were purchased, 9000 miles were driven, and $6000 was spent on advertising. Computer analytics kick that return out for further review. Then an IRS employee looks at the return. Perhaps no computers had been purchased the previous five years, so buying three in one year is understandable. Maybe the realtor is in Montana where much higher mileage is reasonable.  Maybe the advertising expense is legitimate due to location or other market conditions.   Based on the first review the IRS may accept the return, send a letter asking for documentation of a few expenses, or order a full audit.

Think about it this way: they can't audit everyone, so they use some ratios to figure this out.

Let's say you run a landscaping business. You're one of hundreds of thousands of landscape businesses (remember the IRS uses classification codes to know what kind of business you run...)

If all of the businesses in that sector report expenses that equal 10-12% of revenue and your expenses only equal 6% of revenue, it is not worth them digging into the numbers. You might have expenses cotton candy and fancy hats, but to the IRS, who has to pick their targets, that doesn't really matter. 

But if you are reporting \~25% expenses when the rest of the field is at 10-12%, they're gonna look at your numbers. It is unlikely that they will be able to get down to individual computers to determine where they went, but it will be more likely that they will scrutinize every expense category to see where the outliers are. Let's say you only bought one computer and it was delivered to your home, that would probably not raise a red flag, they'll be focused on why your expenses are out of whack with the rest of the competition. Buying a computer is something a business does, but, those fancy hats and cotton candy? Yeah, they're gonna ask a LOT of questions about those.

Tax,comment,l2osi0l,Mister_MTG,,"As many have already said, the burden of proof is placed on the taxpayer to substantiate business expenses. The IRS has no way on the face of the return to know if any business expense is legitimately a business expense. But they can audit returns and make a determination from there if the taxpayer has enough substantiation to satisfy the ordinary and necessary business expense requirements.

Additionally, business taxes are typically complex enough that a tax preparer (CPA, EA, etc.) is hired to prepare these returns. The various licenses have their own governing bodies, professional standards, IRS circular 230, etc. that encourage licensees to report things fairly. The majority of preparers will genuinely try to report accurately and in accordance with applicable laws. They will of course try to minimize taxes to the extent allowable by law, but that is what any taxpayer should be doing. 

And yes, not everything gets caught in this entire process and it is entirely possible for expenses to get claimed that should not. The alternative is also true in that occasionally expenses get missed that should not have.

Lastly, fraud is committed by both taxpayers and ax preparers. It happens and the IRS does prosecute. Fraud is much rarer than you probably think though. What is more common is aggressive tax positions that may seem in accordance with IRS regs. Usually there is some tenuous grounds to support the deduction or credit claim that eventually gets looked at by the IRS.

I recently got a raise this past year or two. Over the past two years I went from making 20$ an hour to 30$ an hour. Before I made 30$ per hour I’d maybe have 20-50$ withdrawn for misc deductions.

Tax,post,1ckegg5,Lightyearvoyager,Navigating Tax Challenges: LLC to C-Corp Transition Post-Surprise TV Appearance,"Hello r/tax wizards,

I'm in need of some Gandalf-level guidance for a tax predicament that emerged after a surprise TV appearance boosted our business unexpectedly. 

**Background:**
Our humble mom and pop operation was thrust into the spotlight with no warning, thanks to a surprise appearance on a major TV show, skyrocketing our sales to $700k almost overnight. This windfall hit while our LLC was on a cash basis. Then came the plot twist: all the related expenses arrived after our business morphed into a C-Corp a month later. So, the LLC's books showed a wealth of sales with none of the associated costs.

**Complications:**
- Our CPA, supposed to be our sage through this saga, missed the crucial step of checking the box on Form 8832 during our tax extension filing. This would have allowed us to retroactively treat the LLC as a corporation from January 1, 2022.
- The unanticipated TV exposure left us scrambling—not just to meet the surge in demand but to manage the fallout with the IRS. Our strategy reserves were more Hobbiton than Helm's Deep.
- Personally, we each earn a modest salary of $65k. Given our razor-thin margins and the money put back into the business, our actual profits were a mirage, yet now we're facing a tax liability fit for a king's ransom.

**Questions:**
1. Has anyone successfully navigated a late ""check-the-box"" election under Rev. Proc. 2009-41 with timing challenges like these?
2. Are there unconventional strategies for handling significant mismatches in income and expenses during an LLC to C-Corp transition that could help in outlier cases like ours?
3. Any advice on negotiating with the IRS when the tax liability ($75k) seems more suited to a fantasy epic than a small family enterprise?

After shelling out $25k on tax lawyers and accounting advice that turned out to be less wizardly and more bewildering, I'm reaching out to you, my fellow tax questers, for any guidance, spells, or clever riddles you might share.

Thank you in advance for helping us navigate this unexpected journey!",2024-05-05T00:12:01+00:00

Tax,comment,l2o7p0s,Lightyearvoyager,,"Thanks for your input. To add some context, the transition to a C-Corp was primarily driven by our need to accommodate new investors, which wasn't feasible under the LLC structure.

Regarding your point about offsetting expenses against revenues within the same fiscal year, the main issue we encountered was the pass-through nature of the LLC leading up to the transition. The LLC reported a substantial amount of revenue before the transition, and most related expenses were only realized after transitioning to the C-Corp. As a result, the LLC showed significant profits, which were passed through to us personally, creating a tax liability, while the subsequent C-Corp incurred losses.

Neither our tax accountant nor our lawyer pointed out the possibility of offsetting these expenses against the revenue if they occurred in the same year, possibly because the expenses were officially incurred by the C-Corp, not the LLC, due to their timing post-transition. Hence, they didn't reduce the LLC's income, which had already passed through to our personal tax liabilities.

This created a situation where the revenue benefited the LLC (and thus us personally through pass-through), but the expenses benefited only the C-Corp, which reported a loss. It feels unfair as the high tax liability impacted us personally, while the losses in the C-Corp couldn't offset that.

I appreciate your suggestion of an S-Corp, but unfortunately, the investor requirements made that structure unfeasible. Do you have any thoughts on how we might better manage such situations in the future, or is there a potential recourse for adjusting how these revenues and expenses are accounted for to better reflect the economic reality of our business operations during the transition year?",2024-05-05T11:05:39+00:00

Tax,comment,l2qxbun,Long-Head1238,,"Apologies but it's really hard to discuss things on here, getting information in bits and pieces. There are lot of unknowns. What is miss the box? Still highly confused on what actually occurred.

You filed a late C corp election, he missed what exactly? To not start the date on Jan 1st? But date of election? Even if you file the election late it asks for what you want the election effective date, usually you do calendar year.

Secondly, are you sure the IRS even accepted the late election, they will reject majority of late elections, it's very hard to get the relief, so if they rejected it you're probably still in luck because you're still technically an LLC.

We had them reject a regular election all due to an issue on their end, the S election was filed on time, they required new signatures, took months to get back to us, then they just said tough luck your election starts next year.

Third, an LLC can have unlimited members, so there has to be a bigger reason for C corp besides just extra shareholders, unless you needed stock. S corp can have up to 100 shareholders, and no foreigners.

If you're saying all the income came when you were an LLC, and all the expenses came during when you converted to a C corp, and C corp election date was totally missed? So he didn't check any box for the date? So if the C corp has an effective date after the revenues came in then yes you are technically out of luck.

You could of amended returns and applied retroactive losses, but that's not possible anymore, nor would it matter since you became a C corp.

But again there's a lot dates, timings, actual events like did the IRS accept your late relief? Have to see the actual form they filed.

According directly to the IRS you wouldn't qualify for a late relief, therefore your late election filing wouldn't count that year, and be counted towards next year.

[https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/late-election-relief](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/late-election-relief)

The late relief doesn't include C corps elections, the late relief can't be used for LLC's... only way to possibly receive it is through a private letter ruling, and even that is a big if.

Since these are the only types of elections covered, and LLC's aren't eligible either way.

* S corporation elections,
* Electing Small Business Trust (ESBT) elections,
* Qualified Subchapter S Trust (QSST) elections,
* Qualified Subchapter S Subsidiary (QSub) elections, and
* Corporate classification elections which the entity intended to take effect on the same date that the S corporation election would take effect.
* The entity is a corporation (i.e., not an LLC seeking an entity classification election);

TLDR: First step would be verifying the IRS accepted the C corp election for said year in question, and what effective date it has.",2024-05-05T22:03:44+00:00
Tax,comment,l2opa6x,Relevant-Low-7923,,"I am a tax attorney, and even though this isn’t what I do (I mainly work with M&A transactions) the following are my thoughts whole I’m sitting on the toilet this Sunday morning.

Normally, companies that sell merchandise are required to use the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes instead of the cash basis method to properly reflect taxable income (to avoid the kind of situation you’re in now). So maybe y’all should have been on accrual the whole time.

If you could just amend the method of accounting used on the LLC’s final partnership return for 2022, then you might be able to just accrue those expenses in the short partnership tax year that happened in 2022 before it became a C-Corp. That way, you’d just take the ordinary deductions on the LLC’s final partnership return, and the deductions would pass through to y’all’s individual returns on your K-1. That’d be the best solution by far to avoid double taxation on that income as well and it would avoid having these excess losses trapped in a C-Corp. 

In your case, you can likely file a Form 3115 requesting a change in the method of accounting for the 2022 partnership tax return to go on the accrual method for that last short partnership tax year. You probably won’t be able to qualify for automatic relief in this situation, but you can still qualify for non-automatic relief, which just means you need to explain the situation and ask the IRS to consent to the change in the method of accounting for the prior short year 2022 partnership tax return.

See IRS Notice 2007-88 below

Tax,comment,l2oryiz,Lightyearvoyager,,"Thank you for jumping in on this thread during such a... *reflective* moment of your weekend! Your insights are definitely more appreciated than the usual reading material found in such contemplative spaces!

Below is the statement from the tax lawyer we hired:

“The issue we've been grappling with is how to get the LLC on an accrual basis prior to its merger. The original idea was that if we could (1) file a check the box (CTB) election to treat the LLC as a corporation on 1/1/2022, we could potentially (2) file its initial (and short period) return as a corporation on the accrual basis. Under Treas. Reg. 301.7701-3(g)(1)(i), when a partnership checks the box, its deemed to be an “assets over” transaction where the LLC partnership would be treated as contributing all of its assets and liabilities to a new corporation, then immediately liquidating which would distribute the stock to the partners. Since the deemed transaction would be a 351 contribution to a new corporation, we could then look to see if we could file the LLC's new corporation’s initial return as an accrual basis taxpayer. A check-the-box- election is generally filed within 75 days of the desired effective date, but there is late filing relief offered under Rev. Proc. 2009-41 that extends this amount of time to 3 years 75 days. However, even under this rev. proc. we run afoul of due dates.  
Rev. Proc. 2009-41; in 4.01 (2)(b) says that if the entity seeking relief has not filed its annual return because it's under an extension, such entities “needed to have timely filed all required federal tax returns…consistent with its requested classification…and no inconsistent tax or information returns have been filed by or with respect to the entity.” Even if the LLC was a corporation on 1/1/2022, and it merged later in 2022, under Sec. 381(b)(1), its tax year would have ended on the date of the merger. When its tax year ended, its tax return would have been due 3.5 months after close (Treas. Reg. 1.6072-2(a)(i)). And even if the LLC had filed a timely extension (which we understand we didn’t), the LLC Corp still wouldn’t have filed its taxreturn timely so that we could file a Form 8832 under the Rev. Proc.
So it looks like we are stuck with the partnership to Corp merger, where the LLC partnership merged with the C-Corp, terminating the LLC tax year on a cash basis.",2024-05-05T13:59:53+00:00
Tax,comment,l2ou633,Relevant-Low-7923,,"In the big picture there are two potential ways to solve this.

1. Get the LLC on an accrual basis for the time period in early 2022 when it was still a partnership for tax purposes prior to its change to a C-Corp (which I assumed happened through a formless statutory conversion from an LLC to an “Inc.” under state law by a filing with the state SoS office), or

2. Get the LLC to have been a C-Corp already during that prior period in early 2022 before it converted to an Inc.

Those are the two separate ways to solve this, but his first sentence concerns method (1), and then all the rest of what he says is about method (2).

I’m talking about how to do (1) in light of the timing issues that would preclude (2).

If it were on the accrual basis during early 2022 when it was still a partnership, then the deductions would have accrued to the partnership before the conversion to a C-Corp occurred.

If it were a C-Corp the whole time during 2022, then the method of accounting wouldn’t matter because all the income and related expenses would have fallen in the same tax year for the same taxpayer entity during 2022 regardless of whether it was on cash or accrual.",2024-05-05T14:15:14+00:00

You’ll need to provide an explanation of what happened to the IRS and hope they approve the change. But you got some good facts, so why not try?

2. How would it work if I collected a sign up bonus for a bank checking account (let's say $300) and then put that $300 into a HYSA? Doesn't the interest generated on a HYSA also get taxed?

Tax,comment,l2n1t4b,SkankOfAmerica,,">If I get a sign up bonus for opening a checking account, am I allowed to use that money before I have to file my taxes on it?

You can use it as soon as it's available in your account.

>Also, will they (the bank or government idk) tell me how much taxes to pay for my sign up bonus when I do file my taxes (next year, right?)

Not quite. The bank will send you a 1099-INT if the total interest (and a bank bonus is typically treated as interest) is at least $10.

Whether you receive a 1099-INT or not, you'll have to report it on your taxes. Interest from a bank is taxable, and goes on line 2b on your 1040 form. If it's at least $1500, then you'll also complete Schedule B.

It will then be included in the calculations you (or your software, or your tax preparer) do to calculate your taxes.

>How would it work if I collected a sign up bonus for a bank checking account (let's say $300) and then put that $300 into a HYSA?

It would work the same way: Total taxable interest goes on line 2b. The bonus itself is considered interest.

>Doesn't the interest generated on a HYSA also get taxed?

Yup.

So, for example, if you get a $1000 bonus for opening the new account, you put the thousand in a HYSA, and then the HYSA pays you a total of $50 in interest, and you don't have any other taxable interest, you would put $1050 on line 2b on your 1040 form.",2024-05-05T03:20:26+00:00

Tax,comment,l2mh92p,alatorratorra,,"You're right. 
But to make it clear for OP: The bonus is considered portfolio income, not subject to self-employment tax. Since it is less than $600, you may not receive a 1099-MISC, but it should still be reported on your tax return. None of the income should flow to a schedule SE, since this was not earned income from self-employment (It is very common for people to enter this incorrectly).
On your tax return next year, the income should show on your Schedule 1, page 1 on the bottom of the page, then to your 1040 page 1.
The interest income, if greater than $10, will be reported on a 1099-INT. If less than that, it should still be reported, but you may not receive a 1099. Use your 12/31 bank statement to get the number to report on your tax return.",2024-05-05T00:44:30+00:00

Tax,post,1ckcx19,taxquestionacc,Foreign partner of a Publicly Traded Partnership,"Hi all

I’ve unwittingly found myself a foreign partner in a publicly traded partnership (I thought it was a regular ETF). I’m not a US resident, and live in New Zealand. I have no connection to the US besides investments in my brokerage account. 

The partnership sent me a copy of my schedule K-1 information that they submit to the IRS. My holding and share of income is negligible, but not zero, so I’m trying to figure out if I’m required to submit some kind of tax return as a non-resident alien.

From what I understand based on googling, 
PTPs must be withholding tax on income paid to foreign partners. Which seems to suggest I would not need to file a return? 

https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/publicly-traded-partnerships

On the other hand, if I did need to file a 1040-NR I’m not sure how to acquire my TIN used by the PTP since the K-1 they sent me has this censored for privacy reasons.

Honestly a little lost here and just want to make sure I’m meeting any tax obligation. As I said the income earned is negligible, but not zero. Never dealt with US tax authorities before the the information is a bit overwhelming.  ",2024-05-04T22:57:13+00:00

My adult child has always lived with me. To go to school in her dad's state, he claimed her a few years ago. He continues to claim her without discussion because he wants the money. I am worried if I mail in and claim her it could cause problems with her tuition.

So whatever, I'll just file without getting the credit I'm entitled to. But no, every thing I try is rejected.

Free Tax USA site filing keeps rejecting my filing and said I can't file head of household because it's using her social. I spoke to a professional accountant who said that is not true, that even without getting a child tax credit there should be a way to include her as a household member, so I can file head of household. When I select ""single"" instead of HoH, my return decreases dramatically.

I couldn't see anywhere to change things on their site and of course their support is closed (and has apparently told me incorrect info anyway) I tried to file on HR Block. Instantly rejected.

I can’t think of any reason paper filing would cause problems with her tuition? Just mail in the return.

Incidentally, if he’s been improperly claiming her in prior years, you can amend back to 2020 and add her. The IRS will ask you each to support your claim that she’s a dependent, and since she doesn’t live with him, you’re on solid ground.

Regardless of what a custody arrangement says, the IRS says that the custodial parent, the one with whom the child spends the most nights during the calendar year, is the one who has the right to claim the child for Head of Household, EIC, and any dependent-related credits.

The custodial parent can ""pass"" the ability to claim the child as a dependent to the non-custodial parent by providing them with Form 8332. This gives the non-custodial parent the right to the Child Tax Credit/Credit for Other Dependents, and any education credits, but the custodial parent can still claim the child as a qualifying person for HoH and EIC. Without the Form 8332, the non-custodial parent has no right to claim the child as far as the IRS is concerned.

All that said, if the custody agreement says that the parents alternate claiming the child as a dependent, and the custodial parent doesn't provide the non-custodial parent with Form 8332 for those years (if needed), then the non-custodial parent would have to sue the custodial parent.

Just that one statement alone leaves questions you did not answer.

Tax,post,1cka12b,pantoponrosey,Lots of upcoming family changes in 2024 and trying not to get stuck with a huge tax bill,"Hi all,

I’ve perused this sub and tried out some estimates on TurboTax’s estimator, and am just trying to check myself here…taxes are not something I’ve ever been super knowledgeable about and a lot will be changing in 2024. 

For 2023, partner and I did married filing separately (which we’ve done for many years due to student loan IDR calculations) and had no dependents, but I’m not sure that will make sense going forward. I’m also just trying to plan ahead for saving money for 1099 income taxes, vs getting stuck with a bill, because that process is new for both of us. 

In 2024….

- spouse 1 estimated W2 income of 93,000 (gross), employer withholds as “married, withhold at single rate”

- spouse 2 estimated 24,000 of 1099 income. Did not owe last year so no estimated quarterly payments this year, but I’m assuming it’s possible after that depending on how 2024 taxes shake out?

- having a baby, so will have 1 dependent. No dependent care FSA and family will be providing free childcare, so no deduction for childcare payments 

- given that spouse 1 is the one with the loans, planning to do married filing jointly given that the income balance has shifted significantly and, per the studentloan.gov estimator, it is no longer a huge benefit to file separately since spouse 1 is the higher earner 

- state: Oregon

TurboTax’s calculator estimates that with all of this, the amount withheld by spouse 1’s employer (plus dependent credits, I assume) will cover the total tax liability for us as a couple and even result in a 4k refund. Does that sound reasonable to you more expert tax people out there? We’ve been setting aside 30% of the 1099 income for a tax bill at the end of the year, but maybe that’s superfluous (and I’d love to not have ~8k just chilling in limbo if we don’t need to.)

Thank you anyone who has some insight or advice, this sub has been so helpful to even lurk on these past few months!",2024-05-04T20:43:26+00:00
Tax,comment,l2ll1w8,Its-a-write-off,,"Figure spouse is withholding about 12.7k.

Federal taxes on that income, minus the child tax credit, is about 11.2k

That works out to about 1500 over withholding as things are now.",2024-05-04T21:04:58+00:00
Tax,comment,l2lkt8a,DeeDee_Z,,"> Does that sound reasonable to you more expert tax people out there?

Reasonable?  Yes.  Guaranteed?  No.

*Married, withhold at single rate* is intended for two people with W-2 income -- the scenario where both spouses have some withholding.  If the second spouse doesn't have withholding, it works exactly as you have seen: spouse 1's excess w/h covers spouse 2's taxes.

If you stay with that plan, and stay at those income levels, your AGI will stay the same, your taxable income will stay the same, your gross tax will stay the same, but the child gets you a **credit** -- yeah, a refund is expected.

Now, all that said, any ""transition year"" tends to throw a curve ball at the estimators AND your tax form.  You may not get as large a refund next March as you expect today, for example.  Filing joint rather than separate may change your tax totals.  Expect those (or any other off-the-wall change), and you'll be in good shape.

Bottom line: ""this should work"" (famous last words), but don't panic if it doesn't exactly match.",2024-05-04T21:03:27+00:00

I have a friend who, due to a pretty rough series of circumstances, was unable to pay his full amount in taxes owed this year (at least upfront). I told him the IRS has installment plan options, but he got back to me saying that when he asked about that to the agent he was working with on his case, she told him the IRS was unable to set up an installment plan for any individual filer who owed less than $10,000. Has anyone else ever heard of this? I'm not finding anything about that on the IRS website, and that's a pretty significant gap that I feel leaves a lot of low-income filers in the lurch... so figured I would ask around.

Tax,post,1ck7xkd,just-another-nate,Help with tax strategy and business structure,"Hi all,

I’m looking for some advice on tax strategies that can help minimize my tax liability.

Background:
I own a Security & Fire Alarm company in NYS, founded as an S-Corp, filed before I was married in 2020 (not sure if that’s relevant or not)

I also own an LLC that I filed in Wyoming on March 15th this year. 

My spouse and I own a single family home in NY, and we have 300k left on our mortgage at a 2.875% interest rate. Monthly payment is $2,310 with property taxes and homeowners insurance.

We are planning to move to CA before the end of the year and will be renting out our home after we leave, and we will be paying rent in CA.

My company does not pay any rent towards the house, but does pay the utilities and my accountant deducted about 40% of the interest and utility payments this past year. I’ve also been told that if my company pays the entire rent I wouldn’t be able to deduct the mortgage interest, is that accurate?

My company also pays for my car and gas, and we deduct the mileage on our return as well.

My spouse is a nurse and works full time, bringing in approximately 100k per year, depending on the year.

I take a small salary from my security company, and the rest in owners distributions. This year, I’m winding down operations with my security company since we are going to be moving and it’s a local service business.

My new business model is much better and fits my lifestyle better (remote work at any time and can provide services nationally and even internationally eventually) and provides recurring revenue so I am focusing on building that right now, but this new company doesn’t have any income yet since we’re still in the foundational phase. I expect to bring in at least 150k net profit by the end of the year.

The accountant I met with when forming my LLC said I should not elect s corp status at this time and I can always do that later. They also said I can decide to put my home in an LLC but it’s not necessary. 

From what I understand, if I have rental income, I can deduct depreciation from my taxable income, but I’m wondering the best way to structure all of this and whether a holding company would be a good idea at all.

We also have to do about 35k of home repairs now due to water damage issues and problems with the way the house was built. So I would like to deduct those as well. I put the expenses on a separate personal credit card with a 0% intro APR so we can spread out the payments (we have the cash set aside though), but the first minimum payment is coming due, and I’m wondering if I should be setting up an LLC at this point for the home and transfer ownership.

If you do provide any advice, can you please explain the reasoning as well instead of just providing an answer? I’d like to understand why I should be doing whatever you advise.

Please let me know if you have any questions at all

Thanks for reading this far and for any advice you may have. Much appreciated!

Tax,comment,l2lg6wl,wild_b_cat,,"You have a ton of questions here and honestly would probably be best served just spending some time with a professional. There's a lot here that doesn't necessarily make sense.

>My company does not pay any rent towards the house, but does pay the utilities and my accountant deducted about 40% of the interest and utility payments this past year. I’ve also been told that if my company pays the entire rent I wouldn’t be able to deduct the mortgage interest, is that accurate?

It's unclear what you mean, other than I'm assuming you're talking about the home office deduction and treating 40% of your home as your primary office. Generally speaking (because there are multiple ways to do this) you can either just have the company pay you 'rent', or you can deduct some of the expenses on the company. You can't double dip (i.e. take an itemized deduction for mortgage interest that you're also paying for through the company) but you can have the company pay a portion depending on which accounting method you're using. 

>My company also pays for my car and gas, and we deduct the mileage on our return as well.

That sounds wrong. Mileage covers everything, including gas. You generally take mileage *or* actual expenses but not both. Just from what you said it sounds like you're double-dipping. Did an accountant advise you to do this?

>From what I understand, if I have rental income, I can deduct depreciation from my taxable income, but I’m wondering the best way to structure all of this and whether a holding company would be a good idea at all.

Using an LLC to hold your rental properties is common, and there are reasons to do so, but they're not tax related. Your taxes will be the same either way. There's not any real structuring to be done here, tax-wise.

>We also have to do about 35k of home repairs now due to water damage issues and problems with the way the house was built. So I would like to deduct those as well. 

If the home is not yet classified as a rental then those repairs are not deductible now. Whether your form an LLC and transfer ownership has no bearing on this - what matters is whether it is a personal residence or a business property.

You may or may not be able to deduct part of those repairs in the future once the home is rented out. Strictly speaking I'd say you cannot, but it seems like a grayish area and I would leave it to an actual expert.",2024-05-04T20:34:49+00:00

We would like to file 2020 and 2021 so he may receive pandemic money plus resolve any requirements for the other years.

[https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/stimulus-checks-irs-deadline/](https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/stimulus-checks-irs-deadline/)

In short, we've compiled the data and checked against the minimum to file. In 3 of the years, there was income that met the threshold to file: 2016 for $15046, 2017 for $14069, and 2019 for $12490.

The other years he had income under the minimum. But when we read the IRS site, it says don't bother to file if a refund was anticipated for returns older than 3 years.

[https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc153](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc153)

Based on this info, we plan to file for 2020 and 2021. It seems reasonable to think he would have gotten a refund for 2016, 2017 and 2019 so we don't file for those because he missed it.

Tax,comment,l2kyf6c,Forsaken-Status7778,,"As in property taxes? Yes, generally municipalities set their budgets and schools set their budgets (through their budgetary approval process), then they allocate the tax requirements to fulfill the budget across the taxable value of properties in their jurisdiction via mill rates. Ie for every $1000 of property value $xzy tax is imposed. Most states require that properties are assessed a certain % to market value, which can trigger a reassessment of property values. Some places require reassessments to occur every so often or after certain events such as a sale or remodeling. A reassessment just changes the property value in comparison to other properties, therefore doesn’t always directly correlate to higher taxes for the property.

If there is a local sales tax allowed in the state, then they can adjust local sales tax rates as allowed by the state through their local ordinance approval process. Ie if the state allows municipalities to have a local option tax of up to 5%, the municipality can adopt an ordinance for a local sales tax of up to 5%.

Every state and municipality is different, so it really depends on where you’re talking about.",2024-05-04T18:47:49+00:00

Tax,post,1ck3m3o,joeshamoe20,What can I do if my accountant lied about e-filing my back tax return?,"I got behind on filing returns during the pandemic, and found a CPA to help get me back on track late last year.

My accountant said he e-filed my returns 3 months ago. When my other returns were processed but not 2020, I asked about him about it. His answer was that the IRS sometimes prioritized newer returns and that it would eventually be processed.

More time goes by and my transcript for 2020 still says nothing has been filed. Nothing from the state either. So I ask for some proof of filing to follow up with the IRS myself, which I assumed was a straightforward request. 

After a week of silence and not responding to follow ups, I ask him if he actually filed my 2020 return. He finally responds with a story about how it's not easy to provide proof of filing due to a new computer system and simultaneously his mom was in hospice and died recently. And that he spoke to the IRS and their suggestion is to file a second return for 2020 by mail. 

Now I've discovered that's not even possible for pro tax software to e-file returns going that far back. And the IRS website says filing a second return can only delay processing while they rule out identity theft. It seems like the 2020 return was never filed, and this is his attempt to cover that up. He refuses to answer any questions about e-filing that return.

Obviously I have to file by mail, but is there anything else I should do to minimize penalties and interest while I wait for it to be processed? I already paid the taxes I owed.",2024-05-04T16:00:18+00:00

I kinda disagree on your capital gains point too. If I put money into Apple stock, that’s not stimulating the economy. It’s basically doing just as much for the economy as if it were sitting in my bank account. I do totally agree that money sitting in a bank account is doing nothing helpful, but those with the means to invest and believe a project will make money, will still make the investment even with a higher tax rate.

We've furnished our resale certificate to the wholesaler, who has requested a North Carolina certificate as well, citing that the inventory will be stored there.

My mom was already suspicious as to why it took so long because let’s call our tax preparer “Vee” had told us he Efiled it. Later on in March my mom had called the office and they had told her their Efiler is down and now she assumed he had mailed our files. Throughout this whole process Vee had been ignoring her calls and messages because she would keep asking about whether or not they were Efiled or mailed. I’ve had enough of this so I started getting into their business as my taxes were wronged as well, I called his office 2-4 times a day the week of April and no answer ! I called and texted his personal phone and still no answer. I finally decided to come into his office and he then tells me the IRS recieved my return but if I want to, mail a copy of the papers in the blue folder. He tells me it has to have a signature so later as I’m making copies of the folders I realize there’s no signature ! So I can’t even mail it.

Me and my mom are furious and I send him a long disappointed message (bc he was a family friend) and asked for my money back and he still haven’t responded ! What should I do? Can I Sue ? Can I file a police report? He’s undoublty ignoring me and my moms calls and messages.

we all switch pay lines this July (don’t ask me why it’s so dumb) so the option is to continue with smaller deductions from our paycheck pre tax until July then pay a lump sum out of our own pockets (aka post tax) to rectify the rest of the overpayment. 
 
1) because i pay a lump sum after being off that payroll, will my gross income appear too high for this past year? For example if i was paid 60k when i was supposed to be paid 55k and now my gross income stays at 60k (since i paid off the 5k after the fact and it won’t be reflected in my W2). 
2) will this affect my taxable income (aka i paid more in taxes than i needed to)

Tax,comment,l2jd75b,cookiebaker22,,"The 1341 credit is essentially a credit for taxes paid on income reported in a prior year that you believed you had full rights to keep, but we’re then required to repay in the current year. There are some limitations, but that’s the gist of it. 

You will need a decent preparer for this in 24. They need to calculate the credit based on the proportion of tax paid on that income. No special forms when you file, but you may be asked to provide proof that you’re eligible (audit or simple review). It was heavily abused in 22 so the IRS is really checking those. I have personally spoken with preparers who filed client returns with this credit who had no idea what they were doing. Based on your description it is something you are likely eligible for.

To show eligibility, you need documentation that you received income in a prior year and were required to repay it in the current year from the entity, in this case your employer. In some instances you’d need to show proof of repayment, but in your case a statement from the employer specifying that repayment occurred through payroll deductions should suffice. The IRS also usually asks for a copy of the worksheet showing how the credit was calculated. 

If your return is delayed or audited, don’t worry. Just answer the questions asked with supporting documentation. 

Final tip, don’t ever send originals to the IRS unless they specifically ask for originals. Ninety nine percent of the time they just need the information from a document so sending originals is just begging to lose them. Even when originals are required, make copies so you don’t lose access to that information while the slow wheels of government bureaucracy turn. 

The repayment of excess amounts received earlier this year should be netted on the W-2 and wouldn’t be eligible for the credit.",2024-05-04T12:59:50+00:00

Tax,post,1cjtmzo,Briyyzie,Question on mileage deductions,"Hi all, question here.

I work for a DDA (Developmental Disability Agency) that does not reimburse for miles. It is company policy for employees in my position to transport clients in their own vehicles. Not including commutes and given very strict mileage limits, I will still likely drive 110+ miles a week for just under 30 hours of work given the continuation of my current schedule. As you can imagine, this is a huge expense-- I estimate hundreds to thousands of dollars yearly, at least 2% and up to 12% and likely closer to 7-9% of my net income goes to absorbing the cost of the gas, repairs and maintenance for those business miles-- and that's not including commuting, personal use, insurance or car payments. Given all those together, I estimate vehicle costs swallow 30-40% of my annual net income working for this company.

Company reps, when confronted about this, usually respond with some vague ""You can deduct your mileage on your taxes"" answer. Said, of course, without giving any details or instructions on how to actually do this. I've done some reading on Google but the information I'm getting is conflicting-- Turbotax, for instance, has an article prominently figuring in the search engine results saying that reimbursement for miles ended with the Tax Cuts and Jobs act of 2018 (https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/jobs-and-career/federal-tax-laws-on-mileage-reimbursement/L6b5ImHo0). Other more recent articles say that you can deduct from miles given certain qualifications that I definitely don't meet (https://www.driversnote.com/irs-mileage-guide/how-to-claim-your-mileage-on-taxes)

I am really confused by all this. It would be a godsend if I could deduct the business mileage I incur until I find a better job, but I don't know if I can. How can I find out for sure? And if I can, how do I go about claiming the deduction using tax software, such as H&R Block or TurboTax?",2024-05-04T06:15:01+00:00

You can no longer claim any miscellaneous itemized deductions that are subject to the 2%-of-AGI limitation, including unreimbursed employee expenses. However, you may be able to deduct certain unreimbursed employee business expenses if you fall into one of the following categories of employment listed under Unreimbursed Employee Expenses next, or are an eligible educator as defined under Educator Expenses , later.

Unreimbursed Employee Expenses

You can no longer claim a deduction for unreimbursed employee expenses unless you fall into one of the following categories of employment, or have certain qualified educator expenses.

Armed Forces reservists.

Qualified performing artists.

Fee-basis state or local government officials.

Employees with impairment-related work expenses.

Unreimbursed employee expenses for individuals in these categories of employment are deducted as adjustments to gross income.

Stop complicating things. If your plan is to have an extra strategy and get out of your business in the next 3 to 5 years go with C Corp or get investors. Your overhead will be higher.

Second 
The credit situation you’re talking about and the savings you’re talking about by not having the income is minor compared to the tax savings that you’ll have with an S Corp. Overhead will also be higher, but maybe not as much as the C-Corp.

Lastly 
If you’re really worried about the small credits, you’re not looking at the big picture. Make more money you’ll be fine. Pay your taxes. if you make enough money that you’re paying over $300+ K and taxes then there are a lot more strategies that you can employ to pay less.

If you make less than $50 - 60k on the bottom line on your schedule C  after your home office deduction. None of this applies to you.

Tax,post,1cjok6q,TonysDoBoy,Scholarship “Unearned” and “Earned”,"
“Earned income includes salaries, wages, tips, professional fees, and taxable scholarship and fellowship grants.”

“Children under age 18 and certain older children who are required to file a tax return and have unearned income over $2,200 must file Form 8615. For this purpose, ""***unearned income***"" includes all taxable income other than earned income, such as taxable interest, ordinary dividends, capital gains, rents, royalties, etc. It also includes taxable social security benefits, pension and annuity income, ***taxable scholarship and fellowship grants not reported on Form W-2***, unemployment compensation, alimony, and income received as the beneficiary of a trust.”

“NOTE: Taxable scholarships and fellowship grants are considered as earned income for the purpose of determining if a dependent must file a tax return and for calculating the standard deduction for dependents.

Taxable scholarships and fellowship grants not reported on Form W-2 are considered to be unearned income for the purpose of calculating kiddie tax.”


I am a full-time student in college, under 24, claimed as a dependent. I will receive upwards of 5k in scholarship excess with none of my scholarships being reported on a W-2. 

Question 1: is a taxable scholarship/grant from a W-2 the ONLY way it is considered “earned income”?

Q2: if the scholarship is not reported on a W-2 is it ONLY considered “unearned”?

Q3: As a dependent, with no scholarships reported from a W-2, will my standard deduction be $1,250? Am I correct in saying that my standard deduction won’t be Earned Income + $400 (Ex: $5000 scholarship + $400)?

I have more questions but it depends on the answers I receive. 

I’m confused on how taxable scholarships/grants are “earned” when trying to determine the standard deduction. OK. My standard deduction would be be $5400, right? So I pay no taxes? But then it would be unearned income for the kiddie tax… so I still pay taxes despite my standard deduction being higher than my total income? I’m just confused and I feel like the verbiage is too vague and ambiguous. I’m also young. ",2024-05-04T01:21:34+00:00
Tax,comment,l2hgrv3,attosec,,"There is every reason for you to be confused, although you seem to have grasped it quite well.

A1 - Almost the only way. For purpose of ONLY contributing to an IRA, GRADUATE fellowships can be treated as earned income.

A2 - For the purpose of determining the standard deduction, taxable scholarships are not considered unearned income. They fall under the “normal” standard deduction ($13,850 in 2023).

A3 - See A2. Use your 1098-T as a starting point but access and use your school account for details since schools frequently get payments on the 1098-T in the wrong tax year (and some other inaccuracies).

A regular scholarship won't be reported on a W-2 anyway, it may be reported on Box 5 of 1098-T but you should double check if that amount is correct.

> But then it would be unearned income for the kiddie tax… so I still pay taxes despite my standard deduction being higher than my total income?

If you look at the calculation in Part 1 of the kiddie tax form, the kiddie tax applies to the lesser of your taxable income or (your unearned income - $2,500). You'd have a zero on Lines 4 and 5 in this case and skip the rest of the form.

I'm not sure if this is the right place or if it needs to go into a legal subreddit but I'm grasping at straws here.  We received a letter from the VA in January stating my wife's VA disability was going to be reduced due to her employment status changing.  She has been deemed unemployable and 100% disabled by the VA for the last 15 years.  

We went to the VA and they said the Social Security Administration reported she had made over the income limit to continue receiving full benefits.  After reaching out to the SSA and gaining access to past tax records online we found some company in Alabama reported she had made $40K in 2022.  Considering we live in Oklahoma and don't know anyone in AL this is obviously incorrect.  

We reached back out and reported this to the SSA they told us to contact the FTC.  We called the FTC and they told us since her taxes and wages for 2022 hadn't been finalized they couldn't do anything until that was complete.  

Since she didn't have any taxes or wages in 2022 there is no way for us to finalize the documents for that year.  Meanwhile this has cut our monthly household income by almost 1/3rd and is going to cause considerable hardship the longer this goes on.

Tax,comment,l2judpn,MrsFlameThrower,,"Retired Social Security Claims Specialist here:

It sounds like someone worked under her Social Security number. 

Social Security actually can do something about this. The fact that the company reported work under your wife’s ssn and that work is in another state from where she  lives should be the first red flag to Social Security that it’s not your wife who is working. Have your wife provide photo ID to Social Security. They then can request the employer who reported the wages to provide them with photo ID and address of the individual that is probably working under your wife’s SSN.  Obviously it’s not going to be the same person, so Social Security can then remove those wages from your wife’s Social Security number. Once that has been done, your wife can provide proof to the VA that those earnings are not on her SSA earnings record.

Problem solved.",2024-05-04T14:55:09+00:00

Tax,comment,l2iwxxi,las978,,"File a 14039 with the IRS. You are experiencing a form of potential identity theft that impacts tax administration, so they will work it. Use of another person’s SSN for employment is identity theft and will impact document matching in the IRS. It could be an honest oversight with mistyped or transposed numbers, but you can’t know that. You may already be in line to get a CP 2000 from underreporter. Filing the 14039 (Affidavit of Identity Theft) should forestall getting a potential deficiency notice if it isn’t already set to go out. 

Identify theft claims are taking in excess of a year to resolve, so if there is a financial hardship contact Taxpayer Advocate as well. Give them specific examples of how the reduced income is impacting your ability to pay your bills. 

A part of the ID theft processing is to contact Social Security to have the wages removed from the number owner’s account, so that should help resolve the dispute over the disability benefits. You’d probably have to deal with SSA to get any past benefits that were lost due to the ID theft and have the original benefit reinstated, but you’d have another federal agency that already made a determination that someone else earned that money.",2024-05-04T10:42:32+00:00

So he's asking if he can sign his paycheck over to me just to cash for cash, and then I give him the money. So since the check isnt for work, and im not getting paid for anything, I'm just cashing it so I can give him his fund right away.

Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh area. Doesn't get a lot of hours. This is his paystub from today Friday which is last week's work. Does the withholding seem too high? He's a single person, no kids, no spouse, no home ownership, no investments. 

He made like $9700 last year. Got like $900 back in the tax return when he filed it 2-3 months ago. Seems like he pretty much got most of his taxes back. Started the job in late June. No winter work (3 months) as it's a seasonal type job.

This year he will make more than $9700 because he started work in early-mid March instead of late June. Here is the W-4 form from last June. Does it look right?

When I checked the status of her return, is showed ""your refund has been applied to a past due IRS tax obligation"", so I immediately contacted her current accountant.  She sent me some documents from the IRS she had in my mother's file regarding this debt, \[EDIT \]her current accountant said ""It appears there may have been a problem with her estimated payments and her previous applied refunds."" \[END EDIT\]

I called the phone number listed on the old IRS documents (from 2021-22) to ask how I can act as her POA to get more information about how much she now owes, or to set up an IRS account for my mother as her POA, so I can resolve this.  She said I would need to talk to accounts management, and transferred me.  After another 25 minutes on hold, they disconnected my call!

Tax,comment,l2gmbnj,NightWriter007,,"In addition to what u/6gunsammy said, it somewhat depends on what deductions you are talking about specifically. If you ordered a new $800 phone that you might have written off as a business expense, you could certainly claim it as a personal phone that you don't use much or at all for business, and now your business net is $800 higher (minus the increase in SE tax, etc.) If you buy $200 worth of toner that you would be inclined to write off as a business expense, and if you were to use your printer for personal printing, say, 50% of the time, only 50% of the toner is a business expense and the other 50% boosts your net profit.

You could also not do an IRA contribution in a given year, or reduce your contribution. Typically, a person increases their IRA contribution when they've earned too much and wish to maintain their PTC. If you are $2000 over the Silver limit, for example, a $2000 IRA contribution will accomplish that goal. The opposite is also true. By reducing a $4000 IRA contribution to $2000, you increase your MAGI by $2000, which could keep you out of Medicaid and eligible for PTC. This is a widely used strategy for adjusting MAGI for purposes of PTC eligibility.

I think it is reasonable to say that the IRS is more inclined to question deductions than net profit, and if you want to pay more income and SE tax on that profit, that's on you...as long as you don't commit tax fraud by faking income you didn't earn or ignoring deductions that would clearly be viewed as business expenses in an audit.",2024-05-03T22:17:47+00:00

You're still reducing pre-tax dollars through that deduction. And you can only contribute up to the amount of your pre-tax net (earned) income. If you are unemployed and have no earned income, you can't contribute anything.

An HSA contribution needs to be made with pre-tax dollars to be tax-deductible and reduce your adjusted gross income (AGI) If you make contributions through payroll deductions at your job, those contributions are typically pre-tax and reduce your taxable income for the year. If you make contributions outside of payroll, for example by sending money to your HSA provider, you can claim those contributions as an ""above-the-line"" deduction on your tax return. This lowers your AGI.

However, you cannot make HSA contributions with post-tax/after-tax dollars and then claim a deduction to reduce your AGI further. The contributions must be either pre-tax through payroll or made outside payroll and claimed as the above-the-line deduction. Using post-tax dollars defeats the tax-advantaged purpose of an HSA. The distribution from the HSA would still be tax-free for qualified medical expenses, but you'd miss out on the up-front tax deduction.",2024-05-05T01:05:31+00:00

Tax,post,1cjhc9a,Gargan26,I received a CP60 notice today,"This may be a little convoluted but here is the sequence of events that led to this notice.

1. on 4/5/2024 I used freetaxusa to file my federal income taxes electronically and specified to have the tax due paid from my savings account. I later found out that this was a mistake on my part as my savings account does not allow direct debits.

2. on 4/9/2024 the payment was rejected due to ""Non-transaction account"".

3. on 4/12/2024 I logged in to my irs.gov account and saw that the original payment was still showing as pending and that there was also a returned payment. I then proceeded to pay the balance due using the IRS online payment portal from my checking account as I had intended to do originally.

4. Sometime later, I don't remember exactly when, I saw that my second payment has now showed up in the processed payments section and it has also been deducted from my account.

5. Today, 5/3/2024, I received a CP60 notice that states that they misapplied payments totaling the amount that I have paid and I now owe the original balance as well as a failure-to-pay penalty and interest charges.

My second payment on 4/12 was deducted properly from my bank account so if I now owe the original balance again, where did this money go? I'm not sure if this means anything or not but my online IRS account still shows the original 4/5 payment as pending, the second 4/12 payment as processed, and the original payment as returned on 4/9 so I'm completely confused at this point.

Tax,post,1cjfokd,lougeezie,Incorporating Offshore (US citizen),"Hi all, I am in the process of creating a crypto related startup. Due to the lack of regulatory clarity, I would prefer incorporating offshore and possibly waiting before operating within the US. I also would like to benefit from lighter offshore taxation if possible. I have some questions about offshore taxation as I know it can get complicated.  
  
If I incorporated in a place like Panama with a territorial tax system, (paying no Panama tax bc doing all/most business outside Panama) but I was a US resident and a majority shareholder in the company how would my taxes compare to just incorporating in the US? My understanding is that I would have to pay personal income tax on my pro-rata share of income generated by my company in US federal and state taxes. Even if I moved abroad (to Panama), I would still have to pay the federal side. Is my understanding correct?

I got my info from this article: [Offshore and out of mind: Reporting foreign assets and gifts (thetaxadviser.com)](https://www.thetaxadviser.com/issues/2024/apr/offshore-and-out-of-mind-reporting-foreign-assets-and-gifts.html)",2024-05-03T18:23:52+00:00

Tax,post,1cjfnlr,FastTrack777,Questions on short sale taxation,"I understand that a short sale is usually a short term capital gain regardless of how long the position is held open because your holding period is usually considered one day.

First, my reading indicates if you bought a call option and held it for greater than one year and exercised it to close the short position, this would result in a long term capital gain. Is this correct?

Second, if you bought a put option, held it for over one year, and exercised it to open a short position, my reading indicates the holding period of the put would have no affect on whether the short sale gain is considered short or long term, as tax treatment is based on how long you held the property used to close the short sale. Is this correct?

Third, how would the IRS determine if a security is “substantially worthless”? Hypothetically if a security decreases in value by 99.999…% but is still actively traded would it ever be deemed substantially worthless?",2024-05-03T18:22:42+00:00

Tax,post,1cjfj28,beaniate,"W4 Checked Box 2C, still need to add extra withholding? ","Hello,

My husband and I owed $8,000 for 2023 so are revising our W4s to avoid that this year. We were advised to change our W4s to single. I’m working through the employer portal to redo my W4 and I am so confused. I checked the box in section 2C. Now I’m at section 4C, extra withholding. It won’t let me advance if I select “$0”, says I have to put at least $1. 

I don’t understand…am I responsible to know how much money we are supposed to pay in taxes each year? I assumed that was all automatically calculated based on our incomes. I’m scared to estimate how much to put there, especially since it is described as “extra” withholding. “Extra” makes me assume it means above what we will already have deducted. But I am afraid if I only enter the minimum, $1, that we will end up owing so much again next year. 

Do I need to anticipate how much I will pay in taxes for 2024? I don’t want to deduct more than we have to but I also don’t want to owe.

If I do have to include extra withholding in 4C, how do I know what to include? I was working almost full time in 2023. I am only returning to work part time in 2024 since I had a baby so I have no idea to even guess my income will be this year. So how would I figure out how much I’ll owe in taxes? I didn’t know it was up to us to decide what we pay in taxes, I thought these things automatically got taken out of our paychecks.

I apologize for not knowing  anything about this, I’m just so overwhelmed after acquiring such a big debt now (that we also now owe interest and penalties/fees on). I want to be able to just pay what we owe through the year and not get hit with a huge debt, it was horrible to learn about just weeks after having a baby on top of everything else. 

Thanks in advance everyone for your help!",2024-05-03T18:17:22+00:00

Since it is May when you are updating your w4, the check box in section 2 will only correct withholding going forward. It does not address the 2k of under withholding already to date. To address that, you could add some extra withholding for the rest of the year. Do you mind if you owe about 2k at tax time, and would rather add some extra withholding, just from now to the end of the year?",2024-05-03T18:54:50+00:00

I checked the withholding on my W4 (it was 1, I switched that to 0 going forward) and asked my wife to check hers as well.

Here's where it gets complicated: my wife switched jobs last year, so she has three W2 forms for tax year 2023: one from her old job, and two from her new job (a nonprofit that also supplements her pay through an additional LLC).

My wife has a zero withholding on all three W4 forms. However, I do see that in Step 3 she claimed the $2,000 credit for our one child, and she did that in all three W4s. Could this be what is creating a much larger tax bill for us?",2024-05-03T17:48:38+00:00

Moving personal money is not a taxable event and does not need to be reported anywhere on your side. Moving large amount of money will of course raise a flag on the bank side but if the source of the funds is well documented it will not cause any problems. This is assuming both accounts are in the name of the same individual, otherwise it may be flagged as a transaction between persons and might need to be justified somehow.

Problems may arise depending on the level of trust of the financial institution the money is moved from. Moving 100k from a bank located in black listed or grey listed country (i.e. tax heavens, sanctioned countries) is different than moving it from a well recognised financial partner.

Moreover, if I read correctly, your money is consistent with earnings. Earnings are taxed at a different rates than other monetary types instruments/income.

If they are indeed earnings and have been reported on a US tax return in the past. Trust me, the IRS already knows the source of the income.

If they haven’t been reported on past tax returns and you are indeed a US citizen, and this is earned income from foreign sources. Please let your tax professional know. As you may have overpaid taxes. In which case you may be owed money, rather than you owing the Internal Revenue Service. 

The FinCen form auto populates in a tax professional program. The professional only has to be certain that the individual’s information is accurate. 

A good professional can help you. However, I don’t think you provided enough detail for a truly professional answer. 

More information is required if you’re a U.S. with earnings from a foreign country. Along with quite a few other factors. 

Please use a Tax Attorney, CPA, EA, or a Tax professional with more than 15 years of experience. 

The laws with respect to deposits have become complicated as well. Reporting is required for some 3k transactions while others are not. At 10k there are very few reporting exceptions. 

If you get the correct documentation from the issuers, a thorough interview with a good tax professional your best option. He/she will be able to answer about 90% of your questions without research. 

With the frequent changes in tax laws. My personal rule is to check and double check.  Tax laws are subject to change after almost every congressional session.

There is no reporting of wires due to amount. If the transaction is deemed suspicious, it could be reported to FinCEN via SAR. 

CTRs are for cash deposits over $10,000. CTRs also go to FinCEN. Depositing under $10k cash at a time to avoid a CTR is Structuring and is a Federal crime. That will also be reported via SAR.

FinCEN is part of the Treasury, but those reports do not go directly to the IRS. The IRS can query the FinCEN databases.

Tax,post,1cjdq3h,anonymous_googol,How does midyear additional withholding adjustment work? ,"After filing my taxes in early April, I adjusted my W4 to withhold an extra $150 for Federal, $40 for state.  This is based dividing what I owed by the remaining number of paychecks I expect for 2024. 

However, my last two paychecks are about $300 less (not $190 less). I haven’t changed anything else except for this withholding. 

Is it possible there is some auto-calculation happening? Like, “oh you want $150 withheld from each paycheck so you want $3900 ($150*26) for the year, so $3900/19 remaining paychecks for the year means we’ll withhold $205! See we did the math for you! You’re welcome!” And similar for state. 

But I already did the math and don’t need these dummy calculators assuming I’m an idiot. Is this what’s happening? The numbers seem right and that’s the only thing I can think of…but there might be other reasons I don’t know about. I’m a scientist, not a tax person…hence this post.

I have a child, 15 years of age, who has always lived in Mexico but has full USA citizenship. Because she doesn't reside in the U.S., I was under the mistaken impression that she could not apply for or receive a social security number. Because of this, I was never able to claim her as a dependent on my tax returns.

Well, last January her mother and I renewed our child's passport, and it was then that I was informed that she can indeed get one. I was so surprised and confused. I could never find a definitive answer about this throughout this time. 

My question is, how far back am I able to claim her as a dependent, when I backfile?? I am afraid that I've missed out on most of the benefits thus far.  Thank you for any information. ",2024-05-03T16:37:11+00:00

Tax,post,1cjberr,Anonymous_So_Far,"Final trust tax return was filed, but trust was not dissolved. Logistics of new IRS filing?","Hi all, our mom passed in late 2021. My brother and I inherited a brokerage account titled to her trust with an EIN (we’ll call this the old EIN). In 2022, her tax accountant stated we needed new EIN for tax purposes. They then filed an initial and final tax return for the trust with the new EIN, but did not tell us or the bank that the trust was to be distributed and dissolved (and the trust attny somehow failed to make it explicit to us).

The brokerage account for the trust still exists (with the old EIN) and taxes will need to be filed for 2023 (and likely 2022). My question is around the logistics of this. Do we file the 1041 for the trust with the old EIN (which is the EIN attached to the trust at the brokerage) or with the new EIN (even though a final return was filed for tax year 2021)? Do we need a note with the return to explain to the IRS what happened?

Thank you in advance! Any guidance is appreciated, even just the right questions to ask her accountant.

Note: we have already contacted the brokerage and are in process of distributing and dissolving the trust, so that 2024 will be the actual final tax year.",2024-05-03T15:25:30+00:00
Tax,post,1cjafrr,et_hel,is it normal to be taxed this much?,"this is my first paycheck from a new job. at my previous job i made $17 an hour but didn’t make tips, and i checked my old paystubs for similar hours worked and was taxed about $100 less.

i only received this check after a few weeks of back n forth with the owner of this place because he wasn’t paying me when he said he would, so i’m a little suspicious of the amount taken off.

maybe i’m just being dumb and this is totally normal but i don’t really know anything about taxes if anyone could provide any insight that would be really helpful :)",2024-05-03T14:44:37+00:00
Tax,comment,l2eqmja,Steeldrop,,"Social Security and Medicare are definitely correct at 6.2% and 1.45% respectively. The rest is driven by a calculation based on what you put on your W4 when you filled out the new hire paperwork. You can probably find the formula online somewhere. 

If you’re overpaying on federal and state, that money gets sent to the tax authorities and you will get it back at the end of the year in the form of a tax refund after you file your taxes. Or you can redo your W4 with your employer and add more exemptions. That will reduce the amount of money that gets sent to the government out of every paycheck. Just make sure that you don’t reduce the withholding too much or you will get stuck with a big bill and possibly under-withholding penalties at tax time next year.

(It’s highly unlikely that your employer is screwing you by inflating the taxes but you can check at the end of the year by adding up how much was withheld from each paycheck and making sure that it matches the W2 that you get at the end of the year. The IRS checks the W2 vs the amount that they received with your name on it, so if the employer is pocketing some of the taxes instead of sending them to the IRS, that will be noticed.)",2024-05-03T15:19:05+00:00
Tax,comment,l2esv1r,VoteyDisciple,,"That's a high amount of federal income tax for this pay.

So far you haven't been *taxed* at all. This sounds pedantic, but is actually deeply important to your question. Your employer has withheld money from your pay per the instructions you gave on your W-4 when you were hired to prepay your taxes  but that could be way more or way less than the amount of tax you actually owe. If you're withholding too much, the government refunds it to you. If you're withholding too little, you'll pay the extra at the end of the year. 

Most of the taxes you'll be paying are fixed percentages, so they're easy to calculate. Social Security is always 6.2%, Medicare is 1.45%, and Illinois takes 4.95%. Sure enough that's exactly what you've had withheld here.

Federal taxes are harder to predict because it's your total income at the end of the year that determines the percentage of tax you'll even pay. 

***If*** this is your only source of income and ***if*** you're earning $487 here each week and ***if*** you are single and ***if*** you have no dependents and ***if*** you qualify for no other credits or deductions and have no other taxes due, then you would expect to pay a total of about $1,000 in tax for the year. In that exact situation, you're definitely withholding way too much tax, and should update your W-4.

In any other situation (i.e., if any of those ifs is wrong) you could owe significantly more or significantly less tax.",2024-05-03T15:31:54+00:00

Tax,comment,l2flc1v,chatherly,,"Federal withholding looks like he may have taken a shortcut and just treated this like supplemental income which is withheld at a flat 22%.

You'll get it back when you file, but if it continues, you should definitely get some explanation.",2024-05-03T18:15:16+00:00
Tax,comment,l2h3tog,Frosty-Wishbone-5303,,Yes it is wrong they are taking out 22% federal tax as a flat rate. It is based off federal payroll deduction tables if this is weekly paycheck be 41 bucks not 107 if its biweekly or semi monthly it's supposed to be 14 to 13 bucks. The rest of the taxes are correct but the federal is way off. I would get their payroll specialist on the phone or in person to fix it. Yes you get it back in tax season but that is not a reward it means you are over paying the IRS and hoping to get it back it is not a reward that is a penalty.

Tax,comment,l2gr0r9,sprinjetsu,,"Based on your estimated hourly wage of $17.34, your annual salary would be $34,677.57 if you work full-time (40 hours/week). After deducting 7.65% for FICA ($2,662.24) and the standard deduction of $14,600, your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) would be $20,077.57. You can expect to pay around 10-12% in income tax, which would be approximately $2,007.76 to $2,409.30.

For this paycheck, you would pay:

- $37.31 in FICA (487.74 x 0.0765)
- $34.84 in income tax (28.13 x 10.32 x 0.12)

Keep in mind that you may be paying more in taxes than necessary, which could result in a refund when you file your taxes. Alternatively, you can adjust your estimated tax deductions by filing a W-4 form to reduce the amount withheld from your paychecks.

Edit: To clarify, I calculated the hourly taxable income of $10.32 by dividing the standard deduction of $14,600 by the total number of working hours in a year (52 weeks x 40 hours/week), assuming full-time work. This means that even if you work less than full-time, you still receive the full standard deduction of $14,600, which would result in an even lower tax bill.",2024-05-03T22:49:42+00:00

Well obviously? No one said it's going to achieve all those things. My example was just to show you that you can introduce a flat tax system that still protects lower income workers. Someone has to foot a higher portion of the bill and that should be middle income and higher income people. Right now a billionaire probably pays 20% tax or less because most of their income is capital gains. If you get rid of all the complex bullshit in the tax code, you can easily make sure the wealthy pay a fairer share

All the other stuff you mentioned about deductions can be fixed in other ways. Do your really need a mortgage deduction if you get rid of archaic zoning laws that drastically reduces the prices of homes? Do you really need an education credit if you can increase funding for public colleges so that all people living in those states can go for cheaper? Do we need 401ks when you can just increase how much they can contribute to Roth IRAs?

Hey everyone,



I'm an F1 student who will soon begin an internship in New Hampshire, although my primary residence remains in Boston. During the internship, I'll be living in New Hampshire for the duration but returning to Boston occasionally, especially on weekends.



Given this setup, I'm wondering about the tax implications. Will I need to pay income tax in both New Hampshire and Massachusetts? Are there any special considerations or exceptions for students like me?



Additionally, I plan to have my paycheck directly deposited into my Boston bank account, even while residing in New Hampshire. Considering my primary residence in Boston, will Social Security tax and Medicare be deducted from my paycheck?



Any insights or advice on handling these tax and payroll matters would be highly appreciated!

Tax,post,1cj9qho,HelpfulDude,Understanding Mega Backdoor Roth Tax Implications,"I’m setting up a mega backdoor roth using my fidelity held 401k and I want to make sure I’m correctly understanding the tax implications. There was nothing in the 401k at the start of the year. I will be maxing pre-tax contributions ($23k) and receiving about a $5k match, leaving me $38k of possible after tax contributions, which I also plan to max out.  My plan can be set up to do roth conversions of after tax funds as soon as they are deposited. Here are my questions: 
1) Do I need to worry about the pro rata rule given the conversions happening immediately? 
2) If so, would I benefit from having more funds in my traditional 401k? I have a rollover IRA with $220k in it that i could potentially roll back into the 401k if that would help my tax situation. 
3) When the pro rata rule is used, are those funds essentially being double taxed, since the roth conversion is funded with after tax contributions, or is the pro rata rule allowing me to pay less taxes than I would have if I hadn’t made after tax to roth contributions to my 401k?",2024-05-03T14:14:37+00:00
Tax,comment,l2ejasw,DaemonTargaryen2024,,"1. No. The immediate automatic conversion will result in the after-tax contribution being converted to Roth before there are any earnings. All earnings will be in the Roth space. 
2. No, a rollover IRA has no impact on MBDR. And rolling that IRA to the 401k gives no benefit to MBDR. Remember MBDR is the act of converting after-tax 401k contributions to Roth, the pretax funds do not get touched. 
3. No they are not double taxed. You’d pay tax this year on the pretax portion converted (say you had some after-tax earnings) but then they become Roth funds, so will be tax free in the future when withdrawn.",2024-05-03T14:36:26+00:00

Tax,comment,l2ekjld,EagleCoder,,"1. No. You can isolate just the after-tax bucket if your plan tracks separate balances. Any traditional IRA funds don't matter for conversion of after-tax 401(k) funds. There is a pro rata rule applied, but only within the after-tax 401(k) bucket.

You have a right to be represented by a professional when you deal with the IRS, but it isn’t a requirement. 

Did you hire someone to represent you?  That could include a company like Optima Tax Relief (companies like that employe CPAs, EAs, and attorneys) or a CPA, law, or tax firm. 

If you hired someone to help you with an IRS issue and they need to talk to the IRS, then the power of attorney form makes sense.

If you didn’t hire someone to represent you, this doesn’t make sense. 

The IRS would never send you a POA form with people’s names on it that you haven’t hired.

My final thought—if you have a Notice of Federal Tax Lien filed because of delinquent taxes, this could be basically marketing by a firm that represents people in front of the IRS. It’s pretty shady, of course. But this wouldn’t be from the IRS.

If you have hired a company and need to give them power of attorney, you can list on the 2848 (Line 5b) that they cannot sign any returns, examination reports, offers-in-compromise or any other documents which bind you.

I just don’t know enough to say that I won’t be overpaying on any taxes. But what can I potentially be deducting? Maybe it is what it is. Just pay 15% on the 1099 and call it a day? (Somebody please tell me lol. It’s frustrating. 😭)",2024-05-04T17:57:33+00:00

Basically my understanding is that, as a freelancer, every time you work with a business, they are suppose to send you a W-9 if they are paying you more than $600 and then you fill it out and send it back to them and then they send you a 1099 of sorts at the end of the year? Do I have that correct lol?

Does this have to be done with EVERY client you freelance for including just individuals or is it just businesses that want to make sure they get a tax write off?

Do I just automatically send a filled out W-9 form along with/after my contract?

Tax,comment,l2ebxyf,Barkis_Willing,,"The above advice is my understanding as well wrt W9s. 

I just want to add a couple thing that I wish I had done years ago and am still paying the price. 

1. Open a business bank account and use it only for business income and expenses. Pay yourself from this account. Do this at once! Even if you are just running your business as a sole proprietor, it’s so much easier to keep personal and business funds separate from one another. 

2. Be sure to set aside a percentage of your income for taxes. Make quarterly payments toward your estimated taxes without fail. Getting behind on this is rough and it gets harder and harder to catch up. I say this from unfortunately bad experience of screwing this up royally. Please take this seriously. I have started making estimated tax payments monthly instead of quarterly as I am still building better money habits and want that tax money out of my account and paid asap.

1099-NEC - the form that your client sends to you, reporting your earnings for the year. If a client pays you $600 or more, they are required to send this to you, UNLESS it's through a third-party payment processor such as Venmo, PayPal, and some others (in which case, you'd get 1099-K from the payment processor IF the payment processor is required to do so.

Tax,post,1cj17ai,vellamour,Got a letter from MO state that $1800 is owed for 2020—what am I missing?,"My partner did not do any taxes for the last four years, so I did them for him since I am better at admin and financial things. I did 2019-2023 all using FreeTaxUSA, and we mailed everything a few days before the due date for this year. 

The ONLY documents he had for most of his years were W2 and some health insurance documents that we didn’t really need. According to FreeTaxUSA, he got a refund for both state and feds for every year I filed. So far it looks like only 2023 taxes have been processed. 

Today, we got a letter from our state tax agency claiming he owes ~$1800 for 2020’s taxes. The letter basically stated that they took his $34 state tax return for 2023 and put it towards the amount. I went back through his documents and tax return for that year and I can’t figure out what I’m missing. 

He received all of his stimulus checks (I went back through bank statements to check). He never took unemployment (that I’m aware of and there were no documents or clues from 2020 bank statements). He has never taken out any money from a retirement account nor used or cashed out any investment accounts. He also did not make any other form of taxable income that I’m aware of for 2020 (again, based on lack of documents and bank statements).

I would also like to point out that we never got a late tax return notice from our state for 2020, despite him apparently owing ~$1.8k. FreeTaxUSA also showed that he was supposed to receive a $40 refund from our state for 2020.

What am I missing? If he did get unemployment, how can I get that documentation? I assume the 2019-2021 returns we mailed in were not received or processed yet by the state—will this amount change when they are processed?

If you don’t find something like that, you could consider responding with a nice letter. Basically:

“I received this notice. I included a copy of the notice. I did not realize I had incurred this penalty and I have taken steps to ensure that I will be compliant in the future. I would like to request that you consider abating any penalties that resulted from my mistake.”

Tax,comment,l2ctwnv,selene_666,,"If you f up your taxes then the government adds a bunch of fines and interest to what you owe. You're not in serious trouble unless you deliberately lie to get out of paying.

When you earn money at a job, you owe two types of tax:

* Social Security and Medicare take a certain percent of your income. They give that money to old people who previously paid into the system when they were working.
* Income tax is based on how much you earn. At your first, probably part-time, job you are unlikely to earn enough to owe any income tax. Super-wealthy people pay up to 37%.

Your employer knows how much they pay you, so they calculate the tax and deduct it from your paycheck. They then send the tax for all their employees to the government. The Social Security and Medicare tax should be exact, but the income tax is only an estimate. If you're self-employed then you have to make these payments yourself.

In January you will receive a summary of how much your employer paid you and how much tax you paid. If you had multiple jobs during the year you add them all together. You then do the math to find the exact amount of tax you owed. (It can be reduced if you are supporting kids or you bought an electric car or other things that the government wants to encourage). You report this number and get a small refund or pay the amount you were short. This part is not required if you didn't earn enough to owe any tax.",2024-05-03T05:02:24+00:00

Tax,comment,l2de3s0,Successful-Bowler-29,,"There’s already solid device in this thread, so I’ll just add the following: don’t buy into all the hype regarding “tax refunds“.  Apparently, there’s a lot of ignorant people out there who feel automatically entitled towards a “refund” each year.  They associate their 1040 tax return with getting a refund but do not understand why they even get a refund or even why they might actually owe money at the time of filing in some cases.  

Think of the amount of taxes your employer withholds from you as prepayments paid in advance to be applied to your total taxes for the whole year. Every time a tax payer gets a refund it is because they prepaid more money than was necessary during the tax year.  So at the end of the tax year, you calculate your exact total tax that you owe, and that amount is compared to the total amount of money that you prepaid to go towards covering this amount.  If you gave more in prepayments than the exact tax due, then the government returns to you the difference, that is your refund.   But if you didn’t pre-pay enough, then you’ll just have to make up for the rest when filing your taxes in a form of a payment to the IRS.  

Theoretically, your prepayments could match your actual tax due, and in  that case there is nothing to refund to you, but also you don’t have to pay anything at the moment of filing your taxes.",2024-05-03T08:55:26+00:00

The W4 tells your employer your tax situation. In your case, likely that you are single and that this job is your on it income for year. That tells your employer how much to withhold from your checks.

You will get checks with pay stubs. They pay stubs will show that your check has had money withheld to pay taxes. You will have social security, Medicare, and income tax withholdings that you can see on the pay stubs. These withholdings are based on an estimate of what you should owe based on how much you have made.

At the end of the year, you will receive a W2 and need to file a tax return. On your tax return, you will report your W2 as well as any other income you need to report. You will also report any credits or deductions you may have. Since you are so young, you are unlikely to have any significant credits or deductions. Your tax return will probably be very simple.

Once you fill out your tax return, you will either owe money or get money back depending on how the amount withheld from your checks matches up with how much you actually needed to pay for the year.",2024-05-03T09:20:38+00:00

Tax,comment,l2e52c8,dirtymatt,,"One thing to keep in mind, since so many people do not understand this, federal income tax brackets are progressive. This means that the first $11,000 of income, regardless of how much you make, gets taxed at 10%. The next $33,725 gets taxed at 12%, the next $50,650 at 22%, and so on. You will never have a situation where a pay increase puts you in a ""higher tax bracket"" so you earn less money. You may have a situation where your paycheck gets reduced because the payroll department at your company sucks, but at the end of the year, when you file your taxes, this will be corrected. You will also likely get most, if not all, of your federal income tax back when you file your taxes, since the standard deduction of $14,600 (for 2024) will likely be more than your adjusted gross income.

It looks like Texas doesn't have a state income tax and I'm not seeing anything about local income taxes.

As a minor with no dependents, no property, and no investments beyond a bank account, your taxes are going to be very easy. You're likely only going to have a W-2 from your employer, and maybe a 1099-INT from your bank to report. I was filing my taxes by phone, entering all of the data on the keypad when I was 16 years old.

And no, it's not the end of the world if you 'f' up your taxes. As long as you don't intentionally lie when filing your taxes, the worst case is interest on any money owed and some minor penalties. The IRS really isn't out to screw you. If you get a letter from them, READ IT AND DO WHAT IT SAYS. The biggest chance for you to get in trouble is to ignore communications from the IRS. At the same time, be cautious about anything you get in the mail, and don't automatically trust that it's legitimate. If something feels wrong, trust that feeling. You can always go to [irs.gov](http://irs.gov) to get official contact numbers and give them a call. Take filing your taxes seriously, but don't lose sleep over it. Don't wait until April to file, do it as soon as possible after you have all of your tax documentation.

Tax,comment,l2e96vq,laz1b01,,"Any profit/income you make, the government wants a portion of it.

.

How the govt takes the money from your income is in two methods. The first common method is through your employer, so your paycheck likely already takes your taxes from it. The second method that everyone has to do is ""filing your taxes by April 15th"" which is basically to do a calculation summary of the calendar year and see how much you should pay vs how much you have already paid (via 1st method); if you paid too much then you get money back, if not then you owe money.",2024-05-03T13:34:04+00:00
Tax,comment,l2edpoy,ohsmaltz,,"It sounds like your parents have some history with taxes. Or maybe they just want to make sure you take taxes seriously. For most people it's a hassle but rarely a problem as long as they file taxes every year. Below is a broad overview.

First off, you'll want to find out if your job is an ""employee"" job (where you get a W2 form from the employer at the end of the year) or a ""contractor"" job (where you get a 1099 form from the employer at the end of the year.) You'll know if you're a W2 employee because your employer will ask you to fill out a form called ""W4"" before you start your employment. One of the questions in the W4 form is whether someone else can claim you as a dependent, so ask your parents if they claim you as their dependent when they file their taxes (the answer is most likely yes).

If you get a W2 job, most of the taxes will be handled by your employer using the information you provided them in the W4 form. Most notably, they'll take out estimated taxes from your paycheck before you get paid. Your only responsibility will be to file the tax return with the federal government each year (form 1040 or one of its alternatives; you can download or fill out online) to reconcile how much taxes your employer took out vs. how much you really should have paid. If your employer took out too much, you'll get a check for the difference from the government; if your employer didn't take out enough, you'll need to send them a check (or money order, direct deposit, etc.) There's usually some discrepancy but it shouldn't be a lot. If you owe too much, then there will be a penalty but if you filled out W4 correctly you'll be fine. And when you do file your tax return, how much the employer took out will be summarized for you in the W2 form the employer sends you after each year so you don't have to track them yourself.

If you get a 1099 job, you'll be responsible for all the taxes an employer would handle for a W2 employee. This means paying taxes periodically throughout the year (quarterly; form 1040-ES three times a year + 1040 for the annual tax return), and you may need to pay self employment tax (for Medicare and social security). But since you're 15, assuming you're in school and just working part time, it's likely you don't make enough so you can just pay yearly without penalty and are probably exempt from paying the self employment tax. But this depends on your circumstances so you may need to do some more research if you're working 1099.

After filling out the federal tax form, you would normally file the state tax form, but since you live in Texas I don't think there's a separate state tax return you'd need to file. (I know, us crazy folks in other states file at least two tax forms every year!)",2024-05-03T14:02:38+00:00

Tax,comment,l2d2qt6,publiusvaleri_us,,"When you get a job, they will ask for your SS card to prove you can work and have you fill out some federal form that is the beginning of your tax journey. This may happen your first day of work. Take it home and show it to your parents.

The [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/) sort of keeps your money and gives it back to you when you get hurt or retire as ""benefits."" They give money to your dependents if you die. They do [this healthcare thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)) when you are old and poor enough. And they keep track of how many ""quarters"" you worked to earn these benefits and how recently you earned them.

The SSN is what tracks all of these benefits and taxes ... and connects you to a lot of other things, like your credit score.

But the SSA doesn't usually get money directly from you. The IRS (Treasury Dept) gets it from (1) your employer, and if you work for yourself, (2) you. This money will be 7.65% in case (1), or 15.3% in case (2). Start praying now that you actually do get this money back as benefits.

The federal form you fill out when starting a job, a W-4, is important. The W-4 commands your employer to take money from you and send it to the IRS. (This is called **withholding**. Employers withhold money from you and pay it to the Treasury.) Don't mess this up. If you mess it up, when you file your tax return ([Form 1040](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040)), you will have to send money to the IRS because you told your employer something stupid on W-4. Be honest on the W-4 and it should work out for the best. Your SSN has to be correct.

You also have to coordinate with your parents to make sure whether they claim you as a dependent. You will have to keep track of this until out of school and college or until you are independent and they no longer gift you more than 49% of your living. You will also need to coordinate your taxes with your parents if you get financial aid, scholarships, etc. They will need to see the forms you get from college.

So for now, the most important thing is to file your taxes every year on time. If you ever make decent money, the most important thing will be to pay the taxes you owe.

As you work every year, you will build up quarters and money in SSA benefits. The IRS reports and pays this from the taxes they collect. In fact, the taxes that you pay when starting a new job would be 2/5 less if the SSA wasn't taking your money. When you make more money, the fraction of money going to SSA goes down, and the fraction going to pay for roads and the military goes up.

So a young person who makes $10,000 in a year is going to pay around 17.65% in ""taxes"" ([FICA is 7.65% and goes to benefit tax](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc751), 10% is the actual [federal tax rate](https://www.irs.gov/filing/federal-income-tax-rates-and-brackets) in the lowest income bracket). FICA will come out of your payroll at $765 and go to the SSA, $1000 will go to the Treasury, and $8235 is left over to keep. Your paycheck throughout the year should be 18 to 20% less than your hourly rate would seem. Your $11 per hour job is now $9.06 for take home pay. If you became independent, you would take home about $10.16 per hour.

Keep in mind that your payroll could be higher or lower, and if it is, you will need to file your taxes (1040) to get a refund, or pay whatever you owe to the IRS. If you messed up your W-4, this is where the mess gets to be a problem: imagine filing your taxes and you owe $1000 all at once!

You can't skip out on the 7.65% FICA rate except in a few rare instances. Almost everyone's paycheck has FICA withheld.

Texas takes $0 from your income as tax. You will, however, owe taxes at the county/state level for real and personal property. Talk to your parents about those.

This tip is free: If you ever want to know what your yearly pay is for a full-time, 40 hour per week job, just multiply the hourly by 2,000. So a job offer for $14.50 should make you $29,000 per year, but not after taxes.",2024-05-03T06:36:02+00:00

I'll add that currently if you make less than USD13,850 you don't need to file your taxes (Though you'll probably want to, because you're almost certainly owed a refund.) Then, until you make over a certain amount (Currently 73k/year) there is free software that will help you do the required math and file your taxes correctly.

Even after you make over the income limit, you can buy relatively cheap software (given your income at that point) that will help you file your taxes correctly, provided that your taxes aren't terribly complicated. If your taxes are sufficiently complicated that you need to graduate to the next level of paying an accountant to do your taxes for you...again, you'll almost certainly be earning enough that the marginal cost is negligible.

In short: For the last 20 years or so, doing your taxes is no big deal. I have moderately complicated taxes, and this year it literally took me 14 minutes and 40 seconds to file my taxes (Plus 190 dollars of tax software.)

Tax,comment,l2e0fty,BillionaireGhost,,"When you get hired, your employer should give you a W4. You can look online and see a picture of what one looks like. 

It’s going to have lines where you enter your filing status (like single or married), any extra income you expect to earn outside of the job, any other tax situations that might increase reduce the amount of tax liability you would have.

This is what helps calculate what gets withheld from your paychecks. We have a progressive tax rate system where high earners pay higher taxes. So the W4 helps to estimate how much should be withheld based on your individual situation.

The W2 is a form you get after the end of the year, and you use it to file your taxes. It shows how much income you made, how much federal and state taxes were withheld, how much social security and Medicare, etc. you get a copy and the IRS also gets a copy.

When you do your taxes at the beginning of the next year, you will be putting that W2 information in your tax return. You can have multiple W2s; if you work multiple jobs in one year, you would have a W2 from each one and enter them separately.",2024-05-03T12:33:57+00:00

I contributed about $1,000 to my HSA for the year, and in December 2023, I realized my mistake, emailed my benefits coordinator, and asked to withdraw my HSA excess contributions. Their staff must have been away for the holidays, so I did not receive my excess contributions until the beginning of January. I also received $650 in employer contributions for my HSA.

My W-2 on 12b says W - $650, and I received a 5498-SA form from my health insurance provider that has my total contributions to HSA in 2023 listed as the full amount that I tried to withdraw.

I applied for an extension on my taxes and have been trying to figure this out without using a tax professional because I believe the penalty I will have to pay is less than $200 and a professional will cost me at least half that. I have seen people say I will have to pay the 6% penalty until I use what was excess, and I am also worried that withdrawing my excess contributions in 2024 will count as a non-medical withdrawal and I will have to pay another penalty for that.

Tax,post,1ciwv0c,No_Data6944,Tax implications (if any) for sending money to U.S from Greece?,"Hi all.

I’ve discovered that the best way to send “large” sums from Greece to the U.S is indeed a wire transfer, not western union or any other non-banking institution.

So my question is, what happens when these sums hit my account via wire?

Lets just say wire 1 is in the amount of $50,000, and wire 2 is in the amount of $250,000 +. Do i have to legally claim, file or do anything differently? These are what I would call “gifts”. Any and all advice is appreciated, just looking for the best, most efficient and legal way to receive funds.

For gifts or bequests from a nonresident alien or foreign estate, you are required to report the receipt of such gifts or bequests only if the aggregate amount received from that nonresident alien or foreign estate exceeds $100,000 during the taxable year.

Finally, non-US persons do not have any exemption for gifts, but should only be subject to US gift tax on US situs property. There is some question whether cash transferred to a US account is US situs, I think the concerns are overblown and this should not be subject to gift tax, but we sometimes advise clients to first transfer from the giver's foreign account to the recipient's foreign account, and only then return to the US. 

If the giver is a US citizen or resident, then they should have a lifetime exclusion north of 13 Million before a gift is subject to tax, but this might matter if the person is very wealthy and may want to engage in estate planning.",2024-05-03T02:59:14+00:00

I have an assumed business name from Illinois, I’ll be moving to WI for school but I would like to make sure I can run my side business with full compliance. 

I’ve looked online and have found more questions than answers, my first being how can I set up wisconsin’s mytax with an EIN. I want to mitigate sharing my SSN as much as possible and especially when client’s request a W9, I was wondering if I would have to set up a personal mytax account for business use or personal use. 

I understand that the account would be used to pay my state income taxes at the end of the year but I am completely lost when it comes to sales and use tax as I don’t know which account to set up. My business would be creating virtual tours as a service, the payment structure would be clients paying per project as well as a subscription/lease to use my scans as a tool for marketing/advertising online. I don’t know if that would be applicable for sales and use tax. I’d like to know to see if I need to get a sellers permit and file ST-12 forms for them. 

When it comes to my EIN, I already have a business bank account without the use of an EIN but I was wondering if applying for one would require me to get a new bank account. 

I apologize for the lengthy post but any help at all would be greatly appreciated!

I have a question about filling out the W-4 form for work. I know it's a simple form, but the last time I did it was a few years ago when I was single. Now I'm married and have a child.

My wife only works part-time, driving for Uber in the mornings after drop off our daughter at school. In previous years, I either drove for Uber or had part-time side jobs. We used to file taxes together, and our daughter was listed as a dependent under my wife. When filing, my wife received child-related low income benefits.

I'm not knowledgeable about tax filing, so I'm unsure about what I can or cannot do and whether I could somehow harm myself. I'd like to not withhold too much tax but also not end up owing anything at the end of the year or potentially receive a small refund. There seem to be only 4 options on the W2 form, if I understand correctly. That we file taxes jointly with my wife, that we file separately, and that someone has to claim the child.

Tax,post,1cismxi,hbob16,Is there anything I can do for Tax overpayment,"I found a mistake in my tax filing this year, because of that I filed an 1040x. I use turboTax and the software said that I own additional x dollars for the 1040x, but I have to send in the payment on my own. So I called Turbotax and the rep confirmed that the software will not withdraw the amount and I have to pay to IRS myself. Long story short, I paid directly to IRS and TurboTax also paid out of my linked account.

What happens now? A quick google shows that IRS will send a CP24E form if you overpay, but I filed on 4/4 and have not received anything. Does anyone know if there is anything I can do to get the refund for the duplicate payment?

FYI, i did call IRS and they said the customer rep has no visibility to the payment side, there is nothing they can do and it takes 16 (i think that's what she said) weeks before they will finish process all the 1040 and 1040x.

  
Edit: Thank you everyone for your help. I was able to get through to IRS on the phone, the representative helped me look into my account.

Tax,post,1cisaoq,natekicksa,Am I being misclassified as a 1099 contractor?,"Here is the current situation:

I was hired by a marketing agency in November 2022 but they hired me on as an independent contractor. They initially started me off at 20 an hour,  15 hours a week and then they gradually rose it to 40 hours a week at 20 an hour. During 2023 , I was required to attend company meetings and client meetings but any other tasks I could do them whenever I wanted to during the day as long as they were completed before the due date.

Just this past January , they lost a bunch of clients, fired 2 people (one was a w2 employee and the other was a 1099) and my hours got cut drastically from 40 hours to 15 hours. They gave me a 5 dollar raise to compensate for the loss. Gradually from February up until now , they increased my hours back to 30. 

Recently the owner of the company calls me almost every day during the week and gives me detailed instructions on how he wants the Google ads campaign for his agency ran and how to specifically do that role, he says it's required of him to speak at least every other day about this. I just recently learned that there is a difference between the relationship of a w2 and 1099 contractor that every business in the U.S. has to follow and looking back , it seems like he wasn't following them to avoid paying payroll tax and offering me benefits.

Worker classification examinations are done by the IRS, the US Dept of Labor, and state Depts of Labor. Each have their own standards that are a bit different, but they share a lot in common.  

There are three main factors in determining whether a person is an employee. 

1: Behavioral control: your boss clearly gives you a lot of instructions and training.  Did you have experience doing the kind of work you are doing now prior to this gig?  If so, this one probably leans toward employee but isn’t a scam dunk. If you are new to Google Ads and the SEO tasks at this workplace, then this points very strongly toward you being an employee. 

2: Financial control: the fact that you are paid hourly and don’t have the opportunity to realize and profit or loss are interrelated and point strongly toward you being an employee.  The fact that you provide your own equipment and set your own hours point toward contractor.  

You said you work elsewhere in an unrelated field. Have you done the type of work you do currently as a contractor previously for someone else?  Are you trying to market Google Ads services to other business or have you done that previously?  If you market your services elsewhere or have done so previously, that points to contractor, but it isn’t super compelling. A Walmart cashier can apply to be a cashier at Target, but that doesn’t make them a contractor…

On balance, probably leans toward employer. 

3: Business relationship: the fact that you are paid for certifications points toward employee. The lack of other benefits points toward contractor, but plenty of businesses don’t offer benefits, but providing the certification payments is actually a pretty strong factor here. 

I should have asked you, do you have a contract?  How long have you worked for this company and do you expect to remain doing this work for them?

Based on what you have said so far, you probably are an employee. 

You could take that knowledge to your boss and ask to be made an employee.  Most likely they will fight back (and fire you/terminate your contractor relationship) or make you an employee but pay you less to offset the higher costs of being an employee. They also can set hours, make you work from the office, etc, that they can’t do now.  In most cases it’s perfectly fine for them to do that, BTW. 

You might be able to have your working situation audited.  If you are the only person doing this work for the business, that might make that unlikely to actually happen. That is doubly true if you don’t make a ton of money. The cost of the audit would be much higher for the government than the potential taxes and penalties that the government could recover.",2024-05-03T02:17:06+00:00

Tax,comment,l2cew8p,Fun_Horse_4735,,"Yeah, your rightful classification is probably as an employee. The company has some reasonable arguments for the contractor classification, so they would get a pretty good deal with US DOL or IRS, I suspect, if they were audited. 

You can fill out an SS-8 to request a determination as to your worker status. Again, no guarantee it will actually get worked. DOL and IRS don’t specifically try to get the most money out of businesses or anything, but they do have to consider the cost of the examinations and the potential benefit to the government and the workers. Much better use of government resources to audit a company that has 100 workers and is improperly treating 90 of them as contractors than it is to audit this business, assuming it’s just you or perhaps a very small number of contractors.",2024-05-03T02:57:14+00:00

Example: (Assuming I cash out the treasuries only on maturity)

a) Treasury yield 5% - I buy them at $97.5 and it has a 2.5% coupon. 

b) Treasury yield 5% - I buy them at $95 and it has a 0% coupon.

In case (a), is the 2.5% interest I get that is state tax free, while the $2.5 capital gain is taxed by both Fed and state?

In case (b), since $5 is capital gain, it is taxed by both Fed and state?

Looking at my tax return for 2023, I can see that the interest is excluded in my state tax return, but, can't figure out how the gain is excluded. 

If that is how it works, does it make sense to pick up treasuries with higher coupon rates?

Thanks",2024-05-02T21:53:36+00:00
Tax,comment,l2bg5ue,DVBscrapper88,,"This is a little complicated, but generally, you don’t earn capital gains on holding treasuries to maturity except for de minimus amounts.

Tax,post,1cir5xa,ThiccOgreSausage,Advice for Tax Debt Owed to state,"Hi Everyone,

I’m looking for help regarding a tax issue I’m having. This is my first time here so forgive me if I’m a bit ignorant to any procedures. I’m also pretty out of my element regarding tax matters, so again forgive me. I’ll try and give as much info as I can.

Basically, I ended up moving to a state with reciprocal tax policies etc. When I did, I thought all of my taxes were set and we were good to go.
Turns out that my employer was still paying my old state, despite the fact I had moved and provided my new address. I should have submitted a new W4 or whatever it’s called. I think that would have resolved this.
So I filed my taxes two years ago, and this past year too. For both years, I ended up owing. I didn’t understand why. I know this likely wasn’t the best move, but I wanted to wait for my tax return to come in this past filing and I would use that to pay the older balance. I thought surely it would suffice since I contributed more throughout the year. When it didn’t, I found out that I had to file separately with my old state to get that money back to me that should have gone to the new state.
And here is where everything fell apart.
It turns out that I had a balance owed to my old state from when I tried to run my own business and failed over a decade ago. They essentially kept the money that should have gone to the new state, and now I’m out of all the taxes I paid to OH.
The old state matter is completely separate and I will need to figure that out at some point as well.
But right now what I want to address is my new state - I tried hard to make sure I was doing things right, and want to make sure I don’t mess anything up here. I owe a bit over $2000 for both years.
So I got a call from collectors today who labeled themselves as special council to the attorneys office. Basically they want to start collecting. 
I thought they were wanting to work with me to try and get the money to them as best as I could, but it turns out she called me to really put pressure on me. 
When I asked if we could set up monthly payments to try and get most of it paid by the end of this year, she ignored me and told me I needed to give a bigger payment today with subsequent payments at the end of each month. When I told her I didn’t have the funds to pay that right now, but could definitely pay it at the end of the month, she got really aggressive and started blaming me and making me feel bad. I should have addressed this sooner, but I don’t feel good about how she threatened and insulted me. She said she had been hired to sue and even called me a tax evader.

Anyway, when she did that I got overwhelmed and asked what can we do then because I want to resolve this but can’t have the payment today, and that’s why I called in the first place to try and set something up and get the ball rolling. I apologized too because I felt bad about what she was saying.
She stopped addressing me after that and said can I help you with anything else, and said good luck and hung up.

So I assume she is going to start doing what she can to force money from me and harass me more.
I called legal aid and I am over their threshold so I can’t get help there. I also called the lawyer referral service but they’re closed.

And so here I am. My goal is to set up a plan to pay off what I owe them, the plan they offered me the main issue for me was getting that large first payment to them. She refused to let me pay it at the end of the month when I know I could.
I don’t intend on disputing amounts, I just need someone to work with me with what I have.
I want to try and protect myself against them with the hopes of being able to start giving viable payments.

I don’t make a lot, I make just enough to be able to pay this in installments with a little suffering. But I also don’t have a ton to save after rent, bills, etc.

Any advice is immensely appreciated. If it comes to worst case I’ll just be out of an entire month’s worth of pay if they garnish anything. That would put me in a really tight spot but I think my landlord would wrk with me if I had to.

Thank you all again. Any questions or more info I can give for help let me know!",2024-05-02T21:19:18+00:00

Tax,post,1cip4na,Outrageous-Bat-9195,Residential Rental - Placed In Service Date,"Taxpayer purchased 2 duplexes on a single lot.  Each duplex had 1 side occupied with inherited tenants. 

Duplex 1 was in good shape. The vacant unit just needed a few small repairs and was rented out. It could have easily been rented without the repairs. 

Duplex 2 was in rough shape and the unit that was occupied was horrible. The tenant was paid to leave about 2 months after the property was purchased. Rent was forgiven for the first 2 months as an incentive to move. So no rent was collected. Both units in Duplex 2 were then completely gutted to the studs and rebuilt in early 2024. Purchase was in 2023. Both units are now being rented.

My placed in service question is about Duplex 2. The purchase price is going to be split between land, Duplex 1, and Duplex 2. There will also be a cost segregation study for each duplex done using KBKG’s calculator. 

I take the position that since Duplex 2 was occupied when it was purchased, it was placed in service on the date of purchase. It was being used as a rental, albeit a gross one. This would apply to both units of the duplex because it is 1 building. 

Am I missing anything that would change the date? The rental period was brief, but it was still used for its intended purpose. The taxpayer also did not know that the occupied unit in Duplex 2 was in such bad shape.",2024-05-02T19:56:22+00:00

Tax,post,1ciot17,fooberroberr,How to find an experienced tax advisor for employee Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)?,"Hello!

My situation is I currently have ISOs from a private company I work for. I received most options at a very low fair market value (FMV). The FMV now from then is an enormous gain. The majority of ISOs have vested and can be exercised. I had a chance to sell some, so I immediately contacted a tax lawyer to create a roadmap to exercise my options and show me any tax consequences. Long story, but the lawyer I got assigned was terrible and seemed to be straight out of college or something. Didn't know anything about AMT tax or basics on how ISOs work. Had to fight to get my couple thousand $ retainer back.

So, what's the best way to go about this in my situation? I want to start to exercise and do it in the most cost effective manner. What kind of tax advisor or lawyer do I need? How can I ensure they actually have experience with ISOs?

After talking with co-workers, they're saying it can be a rather rare situation to receive ISOs from a private company and for them to actually be worth something now - so it can be hard to find a good tax advisor who actually knows what they're doing. I'm worried!",2024-05-02T19:43:34+00:00

Tax,post,1cinyr3,Carolinastitcher,NC taxes and discharged education loans ,"I received notice that my education loan is going to be forgiven tomorrow after 28 years of repayment. 

I live in NC, which is one of the states that will tax the forgiveness as income. Come 2025, I’ll need to figure out if I am insolvent, as far as that’s concerned. 

I read 26 U.S. Code Section 108(d)(3) which says that insolvency is determined by the taxpayers assets and liabilities immediately before the discharge. (Because apparently NC based insolvency on this code.)

Does that mean I need to know my home value, as well as the mortgage payoff as of today? 

My amount discharged is more than my annual income by about $4000. And I will be using a Tax Professional next year, but want to be prepared for that time with this information.

The gambling loss deduction is an itemized deduction, so you have to itemize and file Schedule A. 

The amount that this will cost you depends on your filing status (single or married) and what your other itemized deductions are (state tax, mortgage interest, etc). Let’s imagine you pay $3,000 in state and local taxes but don’t have a mortgage. Your Schedule A deductions will be $40.6 ($37.6 + $3k for taxes). 

Let’s imagine you make $40k/year working. If you hadn’t gambled, you would owe around $3k in federal income tax.  With the gambling, your income has gone from $40k to $73.6k. Your deductions have increased from the standard deduction of $14,600 to $40,600. Your income tax has increased to around $3,750. 

Obviously, there are a lot of variables, but it will cost you a few hundred to perhaps a couple of thousand in taxes.  The more money you make normally, the higher your tax bracket, and the more this will cost….",2024-05-03T13:29:33+00:00

My father owns a single member LLC in USA. I was hoping to lend them around $12,000 to start as new venture. I am struck with two options to do this transfer. 

1) should I be loaning him the $12,000 from my personal bank account to is LLC business bank account. 
If so, how should I do this and where do I get those loan agreements done? Can I do it without help of any accountants and what are the interest rates I should be charging him for

2) sending him the money as a gift. I know that the IRS maximum gift amount is $18,000 for the year 2024 if I wanna lend you more money more than $18,000 will this option be viable?

Amongst the above, be the best option, I am more leaning to loan the money just to be on safe side for tax purposes not that I want to charge him some interest if someone could help me to set up this loan agreement between me and my dad’s LLC it would be great .",2024-05-02T19:08:59+00:00

I use the online software from the green logo company with 2 letters to do my taxes as I've done for the last 6 years. Since I've never had to do a Schedule C before I purchased the Tax Pro option to make sure I've done it right. So I've got 8.5k worth of expenses last year and no income.

Tax,post,1cikwfk,Doit4seedz,Reaching Nexus in Puerto Rico - how do I pay sales tax?,"To be brief, the company has sold to Puerto Rico in the last year and reached nexus. We've spoken with the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury to mixed answers.

The Department of Treausry in PR (Departamento de Hacienda) is saying we don't have to worry because the business only sells to people and merchants in PR, so it's up to the merchants to file taxes in PR.

Since we don't have employees in PR and don't have any further business activity other than shipping product out to PR, the Deparyamento de Hacienda says we shouldn't have to worry about it. Can anyone enlighten us? TIA.",2024-05-02T17:03:58+00:00
Tax,post,1cikj3k,clararockmore,Affordable tax help resources,"Hey there, I am someone who has always worked as a W-2 employee, with occasional freelance work that always earned me less than an amount required to pay taxes.

This year, my life looks a lot different. I started a business, but it has not actually earned me anything yet (lol) and I'm not sure if I will have much earnings from it, but I am in a position to collect sales tax, and as a sole proprietor I also know that any business profits are wrapped up in my personal earnings.

I am also doing freelance work from a couple of sources and am hoping to make a decent income from them (a couple thousand $ a month). 

I just started reading about the need to file quarterly 1099 taxes, how to calculate them, etc. I am a relatively intelligent person and it SEEMS like I could understand this all myself, but it is currently so unfamiliar to me that it feels overwhelming.

I feel like I would benefit immensely from working with someone who understands taxes and could guide me in my individual situation. Ideally, they could TEACH ME, so that I could do my own taxes, rather than relying on them again and again, perhaps with occasional follow-ups if I encounter new situations.

I really need to find an AFFORDABLE option for this. I've seen some people on Upwork who seem to do consultations, I know there are big names like H&R Block, etc... but I would love to know if there are other good options for this.",2024-05-02T16:48:51+00:00

This could be less than $15k, or it could be more. I would reach out to the county's land recorder and see if they have any information. You may have to go in and do your own research. They wouldn't necessarily have the original purchase price but they may have the assessed value from that timeframe.

Separately, you'll want to reach out to the county Department of Revenue and find out what the total sale price was, if that information wasn't in what you were sent. Although I would expect them to send you a fully accounting - i.e. something like:

Sale price: $25,000

Unpaid taxes: $10,000

Final balance: $15,000 (the check you got)

If you see something like that, the $25,000 figure is what you're looking for.

This is a Sales Tax return. You've been collecting sales tax with each of your sales, and this is where you report that and remit the tax to the government. 

The wholesaler only needed your tax ID to prove they had a legitimate reason for not collecting tax when they sold to you. They do not know or report your sales data. 

The government doesn't know either until you file your return. Sure, if you fail to file and they have to send an auditor to go through your financial records they'll be able to figure it out, and they'll then assess penalties, but you're supposed to just tell them so nobody has to go through that effort.

Sales tax can be really thorny especially if you're selling in multiple states or jurisdictions, where you may have to remit tax to a variety of different governments.

The cost of paint and design for the logo portion only MIGHT be a deductible expense if you wanted to be extremely aggressive and are willing to pay more to defend the position than the benefit you get from the position.

Slapping your business logo on an otherwise non-deductible expense does not make it a now deductible expense, whether that be your home, car, or clothing, just as simply mentioning your business at dinner does not suddenly make it a deductible business expense. The deck is inherently part of the home, as is the parking. It would be added to the basis of the home and you would see the benefit when you sell the home. An argument might be made that it was needed, but then the cost must be depreciated over time, rather than a singular annual expense.

# Deducting Improvements If You Qualify for the Home Office Deduction

One way you can depreciate home improvement costs is to have a business and [use a portion of the home as an office for the business](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/home-office-tax-deduction-30117.html). To qualify for the home office deduction you must have a legitimate business and use part of your home exclusively and regularly for the business.

If you qualify for this deduction, you can deduct 100% of the cost of improvements you make just to your home office. For example, if you use a bedroom in your home as a home office and pay a carpenter to install built-in bookshelves, you may depreciate the entire cost as a business expense.

Improvements that benefit your entire home are depreciable according to the percentage of home office use. For example, if you use 20% of your home as an office, you may depreciate 20% of the cost to upgrade your home heating and air conditioning system. (IE A DECK)",2024-05-07T15:51:54+00:00

Tax,comment,l2a8via,Smoggy_Pigeon,,"nobody mentioning sales tax. This is a potential issue depending on what states you do business in. All states have different laws regarding sales tax. likely your physical items will be subject to sales tax, but digital art is a different beast. Product vs. Service, Value-Add vs. Resell. 

Generally if you take raw materials, combine them in such a way that you add value then sell a tangible product, that would be subject to sales tax. This is different then just buying and reselling art, i.e. no value-add, which is generally sales tax exempt. 

Then you have a service, which is generally not subject to sales tax. That is why digital art is kind of up to interpretation, I could see digital art as being considered a product or service, which is why I'm sure states would handle that differently.

Some states have a sales minimum where if you stay under that amount, you aren't held liable for the sales tax. i.e. if your sales in X state is less than $Y, you are not liable to report and remit sales tax. 

You can imagine that a small business would struggle keeping track of sales tax in all different states, and I am willing to bet there's a large number of small businesses that ignore it. If you are concerned about doing everything right, I would recommend using a third party point of sale because they generally handle the sales tax side of things. Like Etsy, Ebay, etc. 

Amazon back in the day used to not charge sales tax on a ton of transactions, expecting taxpayers to report it as use tax on their individual returns, yeah that didn't happen. The states caught on and hammered down. But I'm sure you aren't the same size as Amazon, and if States are gonna spend their budget on chasing down companies that should be remitting sales tax, I'm sure they are looking for the Amazons.",2024-05-02T18:44:48+00:00

If you DON'T have access to a retirement plan at work (i.e. no W-2 has the ""Retirement plan"" box checked), then you CAN deduct those contributions.

In the future, if you decide to convert to Roth, you can do so at any time. Any non-deductible funds would have no tax, and any deductible funds or gains would be taxed as income in the year of the conversion. This is essentially a ""backdoor Roth.""

So the simple answer to OP's question is: It depends. Most taxpayers would not be subject to NIIT on the sale of their primary home, but like most things in tax, there are some nuances.

Basically, you won't pay NIIT on gains that aren't already includable in your taxable income, but you *might* be subject to NIIT if some of the gain is includable.",2024-05-02T20:50:04+00:00

Tax,post,1cigsw5,meekmarmot,What Counts as Georgia Taxable Income for Part-Year Residents?,"I presently live in Washington State and work for a Washington State employer.  I am going to move  to Georgia and am trying to find the definition of ""Georgia Taxable Income"" for next year's (2024) taxes so I can make sure payroll deductions are accurate.  The rough sequence of steps will look like:

1. Live in WA, report to a WA office, all of my work documents (pay statements/W2/etc) are WA
2. Work location in company systems is updated to GA, although I still live in WA and will be going to work in a WA office.  Not sure whether pay statements will still show a WA work location or GA at this point.
3. Continue to live/work in WA state for 1 month
4. Sign a lease in GA, probably overlapping with my WA lease for a couple of days
5. Physically move to GA and start working in a GA office, for the same employer as WA.

Looking at the state Filing Requirements:

>If you are a legal resident of Georgia for only a portion of the tax year ... You must complete Schedule 3 to determine your Georgia Taxable income.

Looking at Schedule 3 and the Instructions, I just see:

>List your Georgia taxable income.

I'm trying to figure out which of these changes determines when my GA taxable income starts.  I didn't find any actual definition in searching/scanning the Form 500 or the instructions.  When does my income become Georgia Taxable Income?  Is this documented somewhere?",2024-05-02T14:16:33+00:00
Tax,comment,l290tv9,Prosystems_wizard,,You have Georgia taxable income once you step foot in GA and start working. It’s that simple. Your state wages section on your W2 next year should be lower than your federal and coincide with the move date if payroll sets it up correctly.,2024-05-02T14:36:49+00:00
Tax,comment,l293ct0,blakeh95,,"It is documented, but it isn't very pretty/accessible to a layperson.  See [OCGA 48-7-30](https://unicourt.github.io/cic-code-ga/transforms/ga/ocga/r86/gov.ga.ocga.title.48.html#t48c07a02s48-7-30) (""Taxation of nonresident’s entire net income derived from activities within state; separate accounting possible; applicability; allowed deductions; applicability of provisions for corporations to nonresidents."") and [GA Rule 560-7-8-.01](https://rules.sos.ga.gov/gac/560-7-8) ""Requirements for Filing"" subsection (b).

In layperson's terms, there are three basic rules:

* Any work **performed in Georgia** is taxable to Georgia.  It doesn't matter where the company is based, where you are when you receive payment, etc.  So, until you become a resident, you just need to figure how many days (if paid salary)/hours (if paid hourly) you worked in Georgia and apportion your income accordingly.  For example, if you worked 10 days out of 100 as a nonresident, then 10% of your income in that period would be taxable to Georgia.
* Any income **earned by a Georgia resident** is taxable to Georgia (it may receive a tax credit for taxes paid to another state though).  This point also raises another consideration, which I will discuss below, regarding when you establish residency.
* Any Federal or Georgia deductions must be prorated for Georgia tax purposes.  If the deductions are employment-related, they follow the same rules as above.  If they are personal deductions, then you prorate them based on Georgia income % (i.e., if 30% of your income is taxable to Georgia, then 30% of say your Federal student loan deduction is deductible for Georgia tax purposes).

Now for residency: there is no bright-line rule for establishing residency.  However, residency is determined on the basis of which state you intend to live in for the foreseeable future barring any special circumstances such as education.  On that basis, you will likely establish residency in Georgia either at Step 4 or Step 5.

With Georgia residency established, you will also need to bring over your other legal requirements to Georgia, such as registering to vote, getting a Georgia driver's license, registering your vehicles in Georgia, etc.  Of note so that you can be prepared--Georgia charges a 3% Title Ad-Valorem Tax on the value of nonresident's vehicles when they are titled in Georgia (and nonresidents get treated kindly there, for residents, the rate is 7%).  TAVT is a one-time property tax that replaced Georgia's old system of annual property tax on the vehicle.",2024-05-02T14:51:38+00:00
Tax,comment,l299o9s,Prosystems_wizard,,"Great comment but I will add that many states do have bright-line rules for residency, but more so filing a return, which has the same effect. Like being present for 180 days for example could trigger filing requirement in some states, regardless of your permanent domicile residence. 

This makes it so that in some cases, out of state college students don’t necessarily establish residency while still having a filing requirement in their state away from home (assuming they meet other filing requirements as well, like a threshold of income)",2024-05-02T15:28:16+00:00

Tax,post,1cifsst,NowSherbet,Help with IRS saying we have not paid our taxes,"TLDR: we paid 2022-2023 taxes early in late 2022 via check and IRS says we haven’t and can’t find the payment. 

So this is a long story unfortunately. We prepaid some taxes early for 2023 year due to some work bonuses given that year. Our tax guy wrote out our checks to be mailed federal and state. Our state one had no problem. After tax day April 2023 IRS say we haven’t paid. We mailed the check and this was withdrawn from our account by “US TREASURY IRS”. We have mailed this statement to IRS. Unfortunately there is no picture of the check from our bank where they said it was transmitted as an electronic check and they do not have the 14 digit tracking number the IRS is wanting because they claim the IRS just used our account and routing number to take the money from our account. 

We called them on and off all of 2023 with the same ~3 hour phone call, wait on hold, then no progress. In late 2023 they said they would do a hard payment tracer and this would take around 120 days and they said if we didn’t hear anything by mail around the first of 2024 it was probably found etc. I checked our IRS login and it actually had a pending payment under 2023 so I thought all was good. Come around to a week ago we get a letter saying we owe the amount and interest immediately or they will start garnishing wages and possible lien on property. This was a significant amount of money we originally sent in. (And we over sent so they actually owe us a refund) and based on just principle I don’t want to pay them again because the money was deposited by them. 

I called them again yesterday and as far as I understand they have placed a hold on the lien since this wasn’t a missed payment but locating a payment. He stated the payment tracer seemed to not be complete and that it could have been an issue on their side with paperwork they filled out.

They should have gone with 2022 1040ES vouchers. If you paid with 2021 vouchers it would be refunded. If you paid with 2023 vouchers it would be applied to 2023.

Reality is that the person who entered the check into their system didn’t bother actually reading the check information to see where to credit the check.  They just ran it through for deposit. 

Did you make a copy of the check before sending it in?  Get your bank statement and circle the withdrawal.  If you made a copy of the check get that as well.  Send it in with a letter of explanation.  You can fax this in based on the fax number on your notice.  Request that this be properly credited to your account.

Tax,post,1ci7o18,RedsRearDelt,CA state refund going to prior years balance from 1994,"Back in 1992 I had a kid.  I had no idea.  She was a FWB and she broke it off after a couple months. In '94 she got on food stamps or something and that initiated the state to get involved.  I was on the other side of the country and had no idea until 1999 when I moved back to California. Anyway,  it was quite a shock but my son and I are very close now. Took me a few years but I was able to catch up on support payments. By the time he was 16, I was caught up. And the state stopped requiring me to pay (directly to them) when he turned 18 in 2010.

For years now,  CA has sent me a letter in the mail saying my refund has been recalculated to zero. I knew there was an issue but I never looked into before now. I don't know why.  It just seemed exhausting. 

So,  now I know it has something about 1994. The only thing it could be, was the child support thing. 

I've tried to call the CA franchise tax board a few times and get the message ""heavier then normal traffic,  we are not accepting new calls at this time.  Try again later""

I'd like to take care of this. It's dumb to give up my refunds every year.

I received an audit notice from the NC DOR saying I failed to file a 2018 return.  This tracks back to one of my Fidelity accounts where the address never got updated, so the 1099Rs they have been issuing me (for Roth conversions) had a state code in Box 13.  I never noticed this since I wasn't expecting it and get my tax forms electronically (so they weren't being sent to the old address and forwarded by the post office, e.g.).

I got the address corrected with Fidelity, and I was able to convince NC that I did not owe tax and penalty for failure to file for 2018.  Fidelity wasn't nice enough to issue a revised 1099R for 2023 before filing my 2023 Federal taxes.

My concern now is TY 2019-2023, some of which also have this incorrect 1099R Box 13.  How can I preemtively prevent this from happening again every year for the next five years as they roll through their audits?  I tried asking this of the NC DOR but didn't get a response.  Is there a way to file but adjust the state code?  Can I do this electronically or would I need to provide some sort of cover letter?  Would they even read cover letters?  Because the State return builds on the Federal one, and this 1099R for one account is only a part of my income, I'm also a bit hesitant to confuse things with a return that would start with more income than this one 1099R that is triggering their audit.

Or, do I just wait for the audit each year and re-explain in a friendly manner what happened and refer them to the prior years' case numbers?  My concern with that is that I get an auditor in the future that is stricter and undoes the prior decisions.",2024-05-02T04:23:46+00:00
Tax,post,1ci6l11,Stunning-Ad-939,Can I change my filing status from Married Filing Jointly to Head of Household and then back to Married Filing Jointly again?,"My wife is a non resident alien, we filed MfJ about twenty years ago, but then took her off the return and i have filed HoH since then until now (last 20 years). Her ITIN has expired. Due to potential future changes, we are considering filing amended returns for the last 3 years as MfJ (and going forward) as there would be tax savings (due to tax rates and deductions....nothing much will have changed regarding the income and assets). We will need to re-activate her ITIN through the W7 route.

Few questions:

* is if it is allowed to go from MfJ to HoH back to MfJ given the above scenario
* should we file the W7 ITIN reactivation separately or should it just be submitted with the amended return submission
* are there are any concerns (ie potential audit, et al) beyond the obvious issue that my wife would now be subject to US tax and attendant obligations (NB she does not have significant assets or income, nor has she ever during the last 20 years)

We switched to Hoh soon thereafter and I am also unsure if any declaration was made to rescind her status (if any was ever granted for that matter).  

Yes we did live together while I was filing head of house.  As she was a non resident alien and all the income was from me (she was retired) and all the children (ie dependants) solely relied on the income I generated I qualified for that status. 

I can see how there may be some issue with her status given your questions but it has never come up to date and I would not know how to check.",2024-05-02T08:07:15+00:00
Tax,comment,l27sbfe,Stunning-Ad-939,,Apologies I should clarify we live overseas during all of this time.,2024-05-02T08:08:23+00:00
Tax,comment,l2bfasv,vynm2,,"I'm not sure if things have changed since 2003, but currently, once you and your NRA spouse elect to have her treated as a resident alien by filing a MFJ return, you're not eligible to file as Head of Household unless you didn't live together at all during the last 6 months of the particular tax year you're filing for, and it probably resulted in you paying more tax than you would have owed if you had just filed as MFJ.

In addition, once that election was made, the IRS considers her a resident alien for tax purposes and the same rules that apply to US citizens as far as whether or not she was required to file a tax return would have applied to her. The filing threshold for someone filing as MFS (which would have been her status if she wasn't filing a MFJ return with you) has been only $5 (yes, five dollars) since the 2018 tax year. Prior to that is was the amount of the personal exemption (between $3k-$4k-ish depending on the year). Therefore, there's a good chance that she had a US filing requirement, at least since the 2018 tax year. 

That said, assuming she really did have no income (no retirement, no bank interest, etc) then she didn't have to file, but you probably cost yourself money by filing as HoH instead of by filing as MFJ. Even if she did have income, if she was paying tax on it in your country of residence, then there's a good chance that she wouldn't have owed any US tax on it and you still cost yourself money by filing as HoH instead of filing as MFJ.

So, what to do from here. If she had more than $5 of income for any of the last three years, look into using the Streamlined Foreign Offshore Procedures (SFOP) to amend your tax return to switch your filing status from HoH to MFJ.  If you've had a place of abode (basically been actually living in a foreign country), you're most likely eligible. Here's a link to more information about this option: [https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/us-taxpayers-residing-outside-the-united-states](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/us-taxpayers-residing-outside-the-united-states) .

This process typically requires you to file or amend the last three years of tax returns whose deadline (plus extensions) has passed. Currently, this means that you'd have to file/amend 2020, 2021, and 2022 as the three past-due returns and 2023 as the current year return. Since you're not living the US, you have an automatic extension to file 2023 until June 17th this year, so that one is not past-due.

If you're also delinquent in filing FBAR reports (FinCEN Form 114- which is required any year that the aggregate of the maximum values during the year of each foreign financial accounts you own or have signature authority is at least $10k), then you need to file the last 6 years.

The biggest benefit to using the SFOP to get ""right"" is that once you're caught up, they typically won't go after you for mistakes on older tax returns. This will prevent any issues when you switch to filing as MFJ. 

One final thing... The election to treat a spouse as a resident alien is a once-in-a-lifetime option, and it's a once-in-a-lifetime option to revoke it. So, once you make the election, it's for good. Once you revoke it, you can never make it again. This means that if you want to be able to file MFJ going forward, and presumably you and your spouse made the election in 2023 when you filed as MFJ originally, then you can NOT argue that you wanted her treated as an NRA in those intermediate years since that would mean you would have had to revoke the election and you'd no longer have it as an option. 

That ended up being longer than I intended so I'll stop there. Feel free to ask any follow-up questions.",2024-05-02T22:53:59+00:00
Tax,comment,l2chbhl,Stunning-Ad-939,,"Thank you very much.  She had no income in any year.  Not even $5.  So I don’t think we need to utilise SFOP for her.  That being said she has not filed any Fincen reporting of foreign bank accounts so that may be an issue?

Another accountant mentioned that because I switched to HoH and she has never filed again and her ITIN has expired that it may be the Govt deems us to have rescinded the Resident alien status and as such the only way to file MfJ would be to petition for her reinstatement, something that is unlikely to be approved (they said they haven’t seen that be successful).  If that is the case I think best to leave it alone.  

If however the scenario is they still view her as subject to us taxes but she simply has not filed because there was no obligation to do so then we might be able to go back to MfJ?",2024-05-03T03:15:29+00:00
Tax,comment,l2cpn6o,vynm2,,"Your problem, though, is that you were not allowed to file using HoH filing status since you lived with your spouse and she was considered a resident alien for tax purposes. Since your HoH status was invalid-- MFS and MFJ were your only options-- using the SFOP to amend to the correct MFJ status seems to be your best option. This is particularly true if you want to file MFJ going forward.

Your spouse making the election to be treated as a resident alien for tax purposes (the 6013(g) election) does not make them liable for filing FBAR reports. ([reference](https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-026-016#:~:text=FinCEN%20clarified%20in,for%20FBAR%20purposes)) You, on the other hand, would have an FBAR filing requirement if you met the $10k threshold.

Look, you can go ahead and claim 200k as CA source income, and probably get away with it.  But if you are audited by the state, be prepared to pay tax on the entire 300k.

I filed my taxes sometime in February through TurboTax and I owed money to both state and federal gov. The state government lied and said I didn’t have to pay since it was only 16$ but took the money out anyways (thanks state).

Anyways, the IRS website shows no balance, even though I owe almost 800$ to them. I tried calling the actual IRS and they didn’t help, just told me it was received and nit processed. I did set up a short term payment plan (I think, I can’t remember and it’s not showing me which plan I chose). 

I was told by both the IRS on the phone and the in person service center (they didn’t help much) that I could pay it regardless of there being a balance or not, which I’m going to do. The issue I’m having, aside from that, is which option do I select to pay it? Is it “towards your balance” or “2023 income tax?” There’s no balance, so pay balance in full isn’t an option.

That said, can you find out where, or who, the registration is tied to? This could very well be a case of applying the issue to the wrong taxpayer with the correct name. Call the number on the notice that was sent to you and talk to them. Explain the situation, and they will most likely help you out. 

If this was reported to the BMV with this error, it's likely that this was done through a dealership and not at the BMV in person. If this is the case, then the BMV should be able to go back to the dealership and figure out what happened. Did you recently purchase a vehicle? If so, this could be the cause. Does the VIN match any vehicles that you own?

Tax,post,1ci4gpn,raaducay,Can I Claim My Manicures as a Medical Expense?,"To add some context to my question:

I am located in Ontario, Canada.

I recently started getting my nails done in Oct. 2023. I had originally planned to continue doing so just for the holidays. I finally got an ADHD diagnosis in Nov. 2023 and have been self-diagnosed as Autistic since 2022. **TW skin peeling** Since I was a child, one of the stims I would do is peeling the skin of my finger tips and around the sides of my nails. This is something I remember vividly (it got to a point where the texture of my fingertips was smooth- barely had fingerprints and sometimes so many layers were peeled off that it would red and hurt) and my family remembers. I had continued this stim until January 2024. This was supposed to be my last set of manicured nails since the holidays were over, but I noticed a significant difference in the amount I was peeling my skin. I had gotten gel textures on that set and so I got another set for the next month and specifically asked the technician if she could add textures to all the nails. Since then, I haven’t picked at my skin (except the occasional hangnail). I’ve been, instead, stimming by touching the textures of the nail designs. Previous to this, I had tried using fidget toys, but I would forget them or lose them often and go back to picking at my fingers. It sounds ridiculous thinking and writing about it, but getting my nails done has really helped me fulfil the need to stim without harming my body.

The reason I ask if this is something I can claim is because I just had my taxes filed and the thought crossed my mind, but it’s very specific and strange so I’m not sure where to find answers. I’ve continued to get my nails done because it really does help me and I’ll continue to do so for the foreseeable future, but I haven’t been keeping the receipts. Should I keep future receipts? Does this count as a medical expense? It’s a bit far-fetched, but I’d just love to know why or why not!",2024-05-02T02:25:51+00:00

Tax,post,1ci4fzd,Fabulous_Donut_7244,Avoiding California taxes on delayed severance,"At the start of 2023, I lived and worked in Europe with no presence in California.  I was laid off mid-year and got a severance.  Then, I moved to California.  I didn't pay CA tax on the severance because it was all completed before I got to CA.

Then in 2024, the union reached a settlement with the employer (go Europe!), and there will be some additional severance coming.  I'd like to not pay CA tax on it either.

On one hand, I'll get the payment in 2024 and I'll be a CA resident for the whole year, so that might be a reason to pay CA taxes.

On the other hand, this is sort of like a delayed payment from work I did when I was a non-resident, so I can see not paying CA taxes.  If you think of it as the last paycheck, no one would say I need to pay CA taxes even if it landed when I was a CA resident.

Is that the right way to think about it?

1 - Reduce the wealth transfer tax credit. It’s currently $13.61M per taxpayer, or $27.22M per married couple. It’ll likely be cut in half beginning 2026 (when the TCJA sunsets). The median lifetime earnings of an American are around $2M. Tie the credit to that amount, as it may change from time to time. (Yes, I think if you are receiving a windfall of the same amount the median American earns throughout an *entire lifetime* of work, every dollar exceeding that amount should be subject to some tax.)

2 - Revamp the wealth transfer tax brackets and rates so that the tax is steeply progressive, culminating in a 90 percent rate beginning at $20M. (Yes, I think if you are receiving a windfall of *ten times* the amount the median American earns throughout an *entire lifetime* of work, a 90 percent tax rate on every dollar exceeding that amount is acceptable.)

3 - Patch up the wealth transfer tax regime and the trust income tax regime. Estate, gift, generation-skipping transfer, and income taxes are essentially voluntary for ultrawealthy Americans like my clients because there are so many tax elimination tools and techniques available to me and sanctioned by the Code. 

**Spending**

4 - Implement a uniform rule against perpetuities for adoption by state governments. Allocate all of the new tax revenue raised from the revised wealth transfer tax regime (described in 1 through 3) to county governments in proportion to their population - provided, however, that a state *must* adopt the new uniform rule against perpetuities for its counties to qualify for the funds.

This new uniform rule against perpetuities would provide that no interest is valid unless it must either vest or terminate within 90 years after its creation. No more dynasty trusts.

I imagine the sale of home one wouldn’t be popular to fix though since many states don’t see that much appreciation so it would look like a gift to wealthy people (and blue states).

The basis idea is a non-starter though.  Basis is about giving you credit for money you already paid tax on vs gains.  Adjusting basis with inflation is giving you less gains or even depreciation just for the time value of money which is taxed everywhere else.   

I do see your point about the gain not truly being a gain because inflation ate into it but that’s why you invested it…to keep up with and hopefully exceed the inflation AND the tax on the gain.

So if you buy your house for $200k and sell for $400k you only pay taxes on $200k because that’s your gain. The tax rate for capital “gain” is preferential and generally between 15%-20%. If you were to reclassify the transaction as ordinary income, you would pay 37% on $400k as that’s the full amount of “income” you received. There’s no recovery of basis in ordinary income.

Which means it’s set based on the average of land and building, instead of the assessed value of that specific building and land, which means empty lots would pay more taxes than they do now, and buildings surrounded by empty lots would pay less than they do now).

So the only way for a billionaire to do that would be to build a walled compound in the middle of a trailer park.

And would lobby for more police and firefighters, which would improve property values in the area, which would increase the assessed value of the billionaires land.

Tax,comment,l2ca431,Nicelyvillainous,,"There is an argument that it makes some sense, because more expensive buildings benefit more from government services like police, fire prevention, and reliable utilities. If the heat cuts off for 3 hours in a trailer park and you have a pipe freeze and burst, that’s a few thousand to fix. If the same thing happens to a $5 million luxury townhome, then that’s $10-100s of thousands.

But yeah, I agree, it does make sense to maximize value based on land.

The tricky question is, though, do you charge more property tax on land in city centers, where the land is more valuable and you want to avoid it being fallow, or do you charge more for suburban areas, which generally have to be subsidized by their city because it just costs more to provide government services and utilities when people are spread out.

Right now though, the real problem isn’t property taxes, it’s stupid zoning. The US has a major fetish for having huge swaths of cities be medium/large sized single family detatched homes with parking. Instead of 600sqft medium sized condo buildings with good public transit, which is a huge chunk of Europe, and turning the extra land into communal local parks and community spaces.
Most cities dedicate something like half the land to car parking, because it’s required by zoning to have a certain number of parking spots per living unit.",2024-05-03T02:23:09+00:00

Generally there’s at least some flexibility with scheduling but generally we have flexible scheduling at work-2 practices as well.  A lot of practices do office sharing and therapists are given time slots where they have access to the office.  Even the practices that do W-2 rarely pay for the amount of time people spend doing progress notes, treatment plans, crisis intervention, and emails and phone calls.  Therapists can make really good money when they own their own practices, but most people working for group practices aren’t making shit.  Many insurances (at least in my state) pay out like $80 for an hour session, and then these 1099 therapists get 60% of that and then have to pay the self employment tax and completely fund their own retirement and pay for their own health insurance.  The best insurance in my state pays out $145, so that’s obviously much better, but practices spread those clients around, so most people only get a few of them.  It’s also impossible to see 40 clients per week, so full time is generally around 25 clients per week, and then no one gets paid for all the extensive documentation that insurance companies force upon us.  And if we don’t do it properly, the insurance companies can come and claw it back from us up to two years later.  Many therapists end up being forced to pay back tens of thousands of dollars that they don’t have over simple errors like not putting in exact session times down to the minute or not changing the symptoms listed often enough.  This is why mental healthcare is such a gigantic mess.  Therapists are burning out and fewer and fewer will even accept Medicaid and other low paying insurances.

Tax,comment,l2dftp0,AintEverLucky,,"Thanks very much for your insights 😇 I don't have a therapist so this was all news to me.

Going from what you said: it sounds like the typical 1099er therapist books 25 clients per week; for easy math I'll assume these clients pay an average of $100 per session (since the lion's share pay $80, but some pay a good bit more). So that's $2500 charged to clients per week, of which they keep 60% or $1500 per week. 

Figure 50 work weeks per year, again for easy math and to reflect 2 weeks of vacation per year, and that indicates gross pay of $75k per year. (And not for nothing, but considering the extensive & pricey education they obtained to enter the field... I've met bartenders who pull down $100k+. I've known Uber drivers who pull down $75k per year, or close. Therapists probably should earn more. And i realize your outfit wants to help with that.)

I assume there are various work-related expenses that the 1099ers would write off. Probably home office expense if they regularly write up case notes or etc at home; Continuing Education & related fees to keep up their licenses; various journals to subscribe to; industry conferences to attend; etc. I would guess these expenses chew up $15k per year, leaving the therapist to earn about $60k per year.

Again for simple math, I'll assume this typical therapist files as Single and takes the Standard Deduction. Going from net Self Employment income of $60k, in 2023 they would have ordinary income tax of about $5460; plus Self Employment tax of $9,180; or total federal taxes of $14,640.

I am opening an LLC in FL (w/ a FL Registered Agent) while living abroad. I am moving to Florida within the next year. The LLC will only have physical operations in FL and online. I have a physical address in MD I use for mail/personal documents that I used to live at.

I cannot use a virtual address, UPS/FedEx, mobile office, registered agent’s address, business incubator, coworking space, PO Box, etc to obtain a CAGE Code.

1. If I use my MD address temporarily until I move to FL for my LLC member address, [Sam.Gov](http://sam.gov/) Registration, DUNS address, and CAGE Code (and using a FL registered agent) — will that open me up to being taxed in MD as well? I do not file a personal MD State Tax Return because I am not a MD resident and don’t spend enough time there per year.

2. Does anyone know another way to legally obtain a CAGE Code while operating a business out-of-state with an in-state Registered Agent?

The Registered Agent and the “Member”, not the “Managing Member”, can absolutely be the same. And that RA or Member can be an LLC, or a land trust without a named trustee on the Florida Dept of State website. 

There are no Articles of Incorporation with an LLC. The Operating Agreement is not required to be uploaded nor is there even a method to upload it. 

So in the confidential Operating Agreement the Registered Agent could be named 0.01% equity owner with zero capital contribution. Then the RA and Member can be same. A suing lawyer would have to bring suit, then get past a pre trial conference to have permission to subpoena the Operating Agreement.

Edit. Lawyers want a retainer. A lawyer isn’t going to sue the landlord without a retainer or an iron clad case of egregious conduct or negligence that they think they can win a lump of cash.

I mean that's great, but your RA won't be the one authorized to manage the LLC so again, your identity will be out there. 


>There are no Articles of Incorporation with an LLC. The Operating Agreement is not required to be uploaded nor is there even a method to upload it.


Sure, but the Articles of Organization ARE visible to the public and that's the same thing as Articles of Incorporation for an LLC. Your Operating Agreement is not the legal document that creates the LLC...it only manages how it operates. 


>So in the confidential Operating Agreement the Registered Agent could be named 0.01% equity owner with zero capital contribution. Then the RA and Member can be same.

[Independent contractor (self-employed) or employee? | Internal Revenue Service](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee)
Common law rules
Facts that provide evidence of the degree of control and independence fall into three categories:
Behavioral: Does the company control or have the right to control what the worker does and how the worker does his or her job?
Financial: Are the business aspects of the worker’s job controlled by the payer? (these include things like how worker is paid, whether expenses are reimbursed, who provides tools/supplies, etc.)
Type of relationship: Are there written contracts or employee type benefits (that is, pension plan, insurance, vacation pay, etc.)? Will the relationship continue and is the work performed a key aspect of the business?


[Understanding the New 2024 DOL Independent Contractor Rule - McLane Middleton](https://www.mclane.com/insights/understanding-the-new-2024-dol-independent-contractor-rule/)
New Final Rule Breakdown

To classify a worker as a contractor, organizations must understand the new US DOL guidance. The US DOL will now examine the totality-of-the-circumstances economic-reality test with six factors. No one factor has more weight than another. The factors are:

(1)   Opportunity for profit or loss depending on managerial skill: This factor refers to whether there is potential for economic success or failure based on the individual’s business acumen, judgment, and/or initiative.

(2)   Investments by the worker and the potential employer: This factor is based on whether the worker is investing money in capital (i.e., equipment) or is entrepreneurial and supports a business function like expanding their market base like a potential employer would be doing.

(3)   Degree of permanence of the work relationship: This factor refers to whether the working relationship is definite in duration, non-exclusive, project-based, or sporadic.

(4)    Nature and degree of control: This factor is based on how much control an individual has over the performance of their work, their schedule, and the economics of the relationship.

(5)   Extent to which the work performed is an integral part of the potential employer’s business: This factor refers to whether the function performed is critical, necessary, or central to the business – or an independent function, service, product, etc.

(6)    Skill and initiative: This factor is based on whether the worker brings specialized skills to the relationship or obtains them from the potential employer.",2024-05-02T14:12:36+00:00

I strongly suggest no one use this service. 
I've been trying to get my taxes filed for nearly two months, and I cannot make any progress. 
I owed money this year because I'd made more than I'd expected due to a sudden shortage in staffing and excessive overtime. 
H&R gives you a few options: repay in full now (with a check or direct deposit), pay in full within 180 days or set up a payment  plan. I filled out the form through H&R and opted to repay the IRS within 180 days.
Proceeding to file, I reach the last screen, and H&R requires me to select between paying the IRS, in full, either via direct deposit or paper check. No other options, and if you don't select one, you can't file. 
I tried customer service three times. The first time I called, the very nice gal had no idea what I was talking about about. The last time I called, I was told to ""just select pay by paper check"" and ""that's what we've been telling people to do."" 
Tried it. Still wouldn't let me file. 
The first time, a message popped up claiming the Social Security Office had the wrong information on their file for me, so I had to call and fix it. I did, and their information was, of course, still accurate.
My last attempt to file was rejected by the IRS. I have no clue why, and now the site will not let me do anything with my taxes.

Tax,post,1chyv3g,sktowns,Home sale capital gains exclusions?,"Hey r/tax folks,

My husband and I purchased our first home in November 2022. He recently accepted a position outside of the U.S., and we've just sold and closed on our home and will be moving abroad soon due to his job change. This home was our primary residence and we lived in it for the entire time we owned it.
We purchased the home for $400k, and sold it for $465k around 17 months later (~546 days)

Since we owned the home less than 2 years but more than 1 year, I understand we are likely subject to long-term capital gains tax on our proceeds. However, on the IRS website I saw some exclusions may be available if the home sale is due to a job change >50 miles away. Unfortunately, all of the tax advisors I reached out to for planning advice earlier this year were completely full with regular tax preparation and said they could assist after April 15th. 

I just spoke to a tax advisor at H&R Block, who said we would NOT need to pay ANY capital gains tax on our proceeds because our proceeds are less than the prorated exclusion amount (i.e., $65k proceeds is less than [17/24 months * 500k profits normally shielded for married couples]).

Does this sound right? Should I get a second opinion?

I hadn't seen anything about proration for long-term capital gains on property, and he didn't mention the change of circumstance exception I had seen previously, so Ieft feeling uncertain. We want to ensure we are setting aside the proper amount so we're not caught in a bind come tax time 2025 (but the extra money would certainly come in handy during our upcoming international move!)

Thanks so much!",2024-05-01T22:10:14+00:00

Tax,comment,l26n0mi,Agitated_Car_2444,,"*>>>...but left my profits in the coin...*

That is not a thing.

If you ""...bought $1k worth of shares, and their value went up to $2k and I sold $1k of shares..."" then you have to report $500 of capital gains. You can't ""leave your profits"" in the remaining shares since each share carries its own cost basis and gains/losses.

Did you buy actual coins, or did you buy shares? Or shares of coins? It doesn't matter. Each share or coin (or share of coins) carries its own individual gain and/or loss and you can't pick or choose that gain/loss.

You **can** pick or choose *which one to sell*, assuming you bought shares/coins at different times (rather than one big purchase). For example, let's say you bought:

* 1 share in January at $10
* 1 share in February at $11
* 1 share in March at $12
* 1 share in April at $13
* 1 share in May at $14

You can, in June, sell your January purchase at $12 and you'll have a $2 capital gain. You can then sell your May share at $12 and have a $2 capital loss for a net capital gain of $0. Thus, no taxes. Now you have three shares remaining in your portfolio of cost basis $11, $12, and $13, respectively. Your capital gains and/or losses will be based on how much you eventually sell each of those for.

What you cannot do is say ""oh, I spent $60 when I bought 5 shares at the same time ($12 each) but I only sold one share for $30 and ""left the profits in the others"" so the four remaining ones still have a cost basis of $60.

Nope, each one carries its own cost basis. Individually.

Make sense?",2024-05-02T01:47:22+00:00
Tax,comment,l26dhbj,zeh_shah,,"So to answer your questions the way capital gains works is like this :

1. You purchase a stock for $10. Your basis in the stock is now $10.
2. Value of the stock goes up to $12 but you didn't sell = unrealized gain of $2 (Nontaxable)
3. Value of the stock goes down to $8 but you didn't sell = unrealized loss of $2 (Nondeductible)
4. Value of the stock goes up to $12 and you did sell = realized gain of $2 (taxable)
5. Value of stock goes down to $8 and you did sell = realized loss of $2 (deductible against other capital gains before being able to be deducted against ordinary income up to $3000 a year / remaining losses are carried forward to the next taxable year)
6. Value of the stock goes down to $8 and you did sell then rebought the same stock within 30 days for $8= realized loss of $2 but you have a wash sale so you do not get to capture the loss of $2 instead your basis goes back to $10. 
7. If you held the stock for > 1 year its a long term capital gain/loss || if less than a year its a short term capital gain/loss.
8. Gains and losses occur when there is a taxable event. With investments like stocks or crypto this can occur when the stock is sold or traded for another asset or investment. The fact you didn't move the money from the crypto wallet to your personal bank account doesn't really matter. If you sold the crypto its a taxable event whether the money from the sale sits on the exchange, in your bank account, or inside your mattress.

Tax,comment,l26k8z6,Aggravating-Walk1495,,"Doesn't make a difference. As soon as you sell your crypto, you have a taxable event.

One bit of terminology here – this isn't ""stock"" or ""shares,"" it's crypto, which is property. It mostly works the same way tax-wise, but there are a few differences. Wash sale rules don't apply on crypto (yet - they're trying to enact them.. and some types of crypto may be considered a security, which may subject them to wash sale rules.. that's another issue!).

Let's say you bought 10 units of ExampleCoin (fake name) at $100/unit, for a total cost basis of $1000.

Over time, the price goes up to $200/unit, so you have $2K of value. You decide to sell $1K of it. As soon as you hit the SELL button and the order fills, you have sold the first 5 units that you bought, for $200/unit. Now, you have $1000 in cash in hand.

Those 5 units originally cost you $100 each ($500 total basis). You sold them for $1000 total. You recovered your $500 of basis, and have $500 of realized gain to report.

Doesn't matter whether you withdrew the dollars – you disposed of the ExampleCoin, locking in the gain. Even if you'd just traded 5 units of it for $1000 worth of OtherExampleCoin, you've still disposed of ExampleCoin, and realized $500 of gain.

First of all I need to attach the bill of sale that was written, even though it was unsigned.

I also want to know if because it was a dealer who sold the car technically that he would somehow need to be involved in this document, but since it only has signature for purchaser then I think i should be fine.

If the taxpayer has a dated signature page that may help but what the courts have said is the taxpayer should have followed up amd not just ""taken their word for it: Especially if the taxpayer paid money to the IRS. If the IRS gets money for nothing trust me they don't just sit on it. Letters fly from the IRS like pigeons to bread. If this is true then this taxpayer would have definitely heard from the IRS. 
The taxpayer needs to get all their documentation and contact the IRS immediately!!
This is the federal government. Don't leave it to the CPA especially one that's already screwed up.
Get everything the CPA says in writing. Your word against theirs will not stand up in court.

Our insurance isn't like car insurance, my deductible is in the five figures.  Something like this isn't for insurance.

For the dollar amounts, suing isn't really an option either.  If the CPA doesn't want to pay, it's more small claims court.

Here should be OPs steps:

1)  Reach out to the CPA.  Send them the notice and tell them they need to get this fixed one way or the other.  CPA might get a POA and get the fees waived through the first time penalty abatement.

2)  If step 1 fails, this step is to request the CPA reimburse you for penalties and interest.  Not sure if the balance owing is $10k just for penalties (appears to be) but OP *needs* to check the letter of engagement they signed with the CPA.  CPA might have limited their exposure, agreement should have a paragraph about penalties - and OP might have signed and agreed to it.

Our insurance isn't something with a $100 or $1,000 deductible.  I've been running my own practice 20 years and I've only used my E&O insurance once.

3)  If CPA is stonewalling OP after these steps, *and* the letter of engagement doesn't limit the CPA exposure, OP would need to file a complaint in small claims court.  OP should also file a complaint with their states' board of accountancy.",2024-05-01T21:39:01+00:00

Tax,comment,l291bt8,Due-Application-6737,,"I am a CPA, and I never advised my tax clients to put medical expenses in their Schedule A, if they have no proper documentations. First, they only allowed medical expenses above 7.5% of your AGI. Good example is- if your AGI is $100,000. It means- only the excess of $7,500 is allowed to be deducted. ($100,000 x 7.5%= $7,500). So if your medical expenses, is $10,000, only $2,500 is allowable, and all reimbursements are excluded too. 
Medical expenses is one of the red flags, so if no proper documentation, I will never tell my client to add it in their Itemized deductions. And most of the time, standard deductions maybe higher than itemized depending on my clients’ situation- like, did they pay mortgage interest, did they give to charity, and what about state taxes (if you are in a State that has income tax).
This time, your preparer may be in troubled too, if you mentioned that to the IRS. Although, it is Not Our responsibility to check your receipts, but we should practice due diligence- that’s where the interview process should take in. To Make sure, that the information provided by clients are reliable informations.

This plan was created under an LLC that remains active, but I am not currently generating any personal income from (i.e. I'm now a W2 employee and have access to a 403(b) retirement plan there).

Vanguard sold its small business plans (including their SE 401(k)s) and will soon transfer funds to a new company that will likely charge higher fees. Thus, I would prefer to transfer the funds out of my Vanguard SE 401(k) plan to Fidelity, where I hold most of my other funds.

Unfortunately, Fidelity's SE 401(k) plan does not offer a Roth option. Thus, it doesn't seem like transferring the plan from Vanguard to Fidelity would be possible.

Given that, here's what I'm considering:

* Terminate the Vanguard plan and roll those funds into a Traditional IRA and Roth IRA at Fidelity.
* Do a reverse rollover of my Traditional IRA to my current employer's 403(b) plan to zero-balance the Traditional IRA (given that I've already performed a backdoor Roth conversion this year).

A) Does the above plan sound reasonable?

B) Would the above plan expose me to the pro rata rules governing backdoor Roth conversions, even if I zero-balance the account before the end of the year?

I waited some days and found that HR team made an error. They said it will be available on Feb 28. I requested emergency fund continously because I had no money for my rent and credit card. 

They refused it many times but finally made a check for 2 paychecks (Jan 31 and Feb 14) in Feb 14. And I got 3 times of regular paycheck in Feb 28. However, payroll tax deducted excessively because of the progressive brackets.

Now they say I have to repay the check with all amount I got. It might seem to be reasonable. However, it is not okay with me because I lose the amount of excessive tax. And they said I have to wait to get the excessive ones by next year's tax refund season, or I should write down some tax adjustment papers and process it.

I do not understand why I have to do those stuffs even they caused the issue. And I saw they have to give me additional 5% of delayed paycheck when it happens after 5 to 15 days.

There are some ways I consider.

1. Repay the check with whole after I got the tax refund next year.

Your employer cannot get those back. You are the only one who can claim them, and the claim process is by filing an income tax return after the tax year is done.

As far as your January 31 paycheck being late, you may consider filing a claim with your state about late payment of wages. That is a serious issue. Realize though, that if you file a complaint, your company may try to find a way to edge you out and lay you off. It isn't fair, but it does happen.

Also make sure you are aware of your state's laws regarding repayment of overpaid wages. Here in california, they are not allowed to deduct that from a future paycheck without your consent.

Tax,post,1chtimu,Lordkilgore,Advice on Boss Committing Tax Fraud with “1099 Employees”,"My partner works for a company remotely doing sales and event planning. They work full time as do several others that have their same position in different markets. There are also other full-time positions in different aspects of the company. The boss has them all listed as 1099 private contract workers. They have 0 benefits/protections and have been asking to become W-2 employees for over the last year. The boss refuses to do this and his reasons are vague, claiming it’s a lot of work and they are a small start up, blah, blah, blah. Obviously, the real reason is that he doesn’t want to pay taxes/unemployment/workers comp etc etc. I know this is fraud, because all the “1099” are clearly defined as employees by the guidelines.

This has all come to a head when my partner asked for 2 weeks off as they haven’t taken more than a day or 2 off in over a year. They gave a month heads up to the boss, and he is saying they can’t take more than a couple days, a week at max, because the company is way to busy right now. This is almost always the response when any worker tries to take time off. Mind you, they aren’t getting paid vacation for any time off and on top of that, the boss cant legally tell them when they can take off because they are 1099. We have receipts on all these conversations through email correspondence.

There was an expectation that my partner and others who started from the beginning would be compensated and taken care of as the company grew. It has grown and is rapidly expanding thanks to the efforts of my partner and their co-workers, but wage increases have been minimal and as stated they are still all 1099’d with no benefits whatsoever. It’s becoming clear to me that the boss is trying to expand rapidly, most likely so he can sell and throw all the people that built his company under the bus.

My question is how would one handle this? We could contact the labor board and other entities informing of the boss’s misclassification of his workers most likely due to committing tax evasion.  This is probably the right answer, but may result in the loss of people’s jobs. My partner is currently looking for other positions as they are over working for this piece of shit, but is a bit hesitant to destroy the company, because they are friends with many of the co-workers. They also don’t  want to lose the job/income until they find other work, but really need the time off for mental health, which they have directly stated to the boss. I don’t think they would have any sort of lawsuit against the boss, even if he would “fire” them or say their contract is no longer needed if they chose to just take the 2 weeks off anyway. Basically, how do we fuck this dude over without fucking my partner and her employees over at the same time ?

Tax,post,1chsr9o,assalokj,Federal withholding: Decided to lower to zero. Bad Idea?,"Last November I started doing some side work that I get paid on a 1099.  It is sporadic and not a ton of money but every little bit helps.  Since I already have to spend the time and make sure I set aside taxes for this I thought I'd do the same for my main W2 job.  So I lowered my federal withholdings to $0. 

&#x200B;

My thinking is if I already have to spend the mental energy to make sure I'm setting money aside why give the US an interest free loan.  I just set it up in my payroll site to move the extra money into a savings account where I can make 4.6% on the money.  This past month I got like $7.50 of interest on the money I have saved for taxes.  So clearly it's not much but hey, why not?  I'm still paying social security, state taxes, and medicare.

&#x200B;

My only issue is I feel like the documentation I have found surrounding when someone needs to make quarterly payments is vague. I'm trying to figure out if I'm creating more of a headache than it is worth. So I had a few questions:

Is there a certain dollar amount someone hits in a quarter that determines they need to make quarterly payments?

Does the fact that I have both w2 income and 1099 income have any effect on whether I have to make quarterly payments?

Does anyone have a comprehensive document about this topic?  I feel like everything I have found online is incomplete.

&#x200B;

EDIT: For people asking why not just increase my w2 withholding I had 2 reasons.  You might think they're dumb and you may be right.  

The 1099 income could vary from almost nothing up to at most $6000 each month.  It's very inconsistent so I'd rather just set aside the correct amount each time I get it.

Generally, if you will owe more than $1,000 in tax for the full year (after subtracting payments made via withholding), then that tax must be paid in timely installments on a quarterly basis.

There are certain exceptions based on your prior-year situation.

>Does the fact that I have both w2 income and 1099 income have any effect on whether I have to make quarterly payments?

No.  All of your tax and all of your payments are equivalent.  The only difference with wage income is that payments are automatically calculated and made on your behalf via withholding, which isn't an option for most other types of income.

The principle you're following is right. Paying your taxes quarterly either through payroll withholding or estimated payments during the year are required by law. The only time you're giving the government a tax-free loan is when you overpay and get a refund.

However, you need to be continually diligent and committed to a method of controlling your withholding and estimated payments. As a tax professional I've seen lots of people (most) who tried methods like this got sideways on taxes because they did not continually follow through with the process. If you do keep your eyes on your situation continually and make sure you don't miss any payments your process can work. In fact now since I'm retired I do that with estimated payments. I look at my personal accounts every day and know how much money I have everywhere to the penny. Most people start out great but lose interest and let things slide, or worse, enjoy the tax-free paychecks and don't make the right adjustments.

Your withholding is not an interest free loan to the IRS. Any overpayment of taxes at the end of the year would be, but your actual tax liability is a number you owe to the IRS. If you end the year owing $10,000 and you've paid $9,000 then you will owe an additional $1,000. No interest free loans here. If you instead paid $11,000 then you're getting a refund of $1,000 which was an ""interest free loan"".

Then, you basically need to be your own employer (which is why it's not uncommon for my S Corp clients) because you need to be in control of how much you're paying yourself. If your tax liability is going to be $25k or whatever, you aren't going to be able to withhold that much on a paycheck where your gross earnings are only like $4k.

So if you have a normal job where you work for some company that sets your salary, the most you could possibly withhold would be whatever is leftover after FICA and other items like retirement deferrals. An S Corp shareholder/employee could simply use payroll as an intermediary for simultaneously meeting the reasonable compensation requirements of an S Corp officer and remitting their withholding in one lump sum, but you can see how this wouldn't really work for your average employee.

Unless you have a huge amount of gross wages and earn quite a bit more than you need to support yourself, it's not realistic to ramp up your withholdings to take advantage of this at the end of the year because it would basically mean leaving no actual wages for yourself.",2024-05-01T21:52:28+00:00

You just have your employer send your entire final 3ish paychecks to the irs and you live off what you saved and invested throughout the year.

It's not so much a tax question as a cash flow one, because on my end I would just see a W-2 with $X withholding and that's that. 

To be clear, I never said you *need* to be an S Corp to do this. I said it's not uncommon for S Corps, because in that case you have complete control over your wages. The hypothetical you're posing should work in theory, but you'd need to be very careful that you submitted a revised W-4 in a timely fashion and that it was correct. The biggest issue is most likely to be whether you can comfortable live off savings while you defer 100% of your paychecks for over a month towards income taxes. This is not feasible for the average taxpayer, and the potential benefits from instead investing your withholding would be small enough in most cases that it's not worth the potential headaches. It's an interesting thought experiment, but not something I'd ever recommend to someone unless they have a lot of extra cash. From a pure money management perspective, it would not generally be wise to use your emergency savings to cover yourself while you do a bunch of withholding at the end of the year.

Filing end of the year tax return, being alone he would owe or “need to pay in” but after adding me as a joint filing spouse and our 3 children we then receive a refund. Right now our refund status has been saying “Your refund has been delayed because of an indication of bankruptcy on your account. Refunds for overpayments of income tax may be the property of the bankruptcy estate.” 

My question is, will his bankruptcy trustee take the refund even though it was not technically owed to him? It was based off of my income and child tax credit. Just curious if we need to file separate for the remaining years ",2024-05-01T18:00:24+00:00

Tax,post,1chsa7y,charles-danger,Schedule C/1099-K: How to deduct Mystery Shopping expenses that I was reimbursed for?,"For my ""Mystery Shopping"" side gig, I go to restaurants, spas, ski resorts, parking garages, amusement parks, etc. to buy/do what they tell me to and write a report about it. I get paid a fee and reimbursed for my expenses.

Companies that paid me through direct deposit sent me a 1099-NEC that showed only my income and not expense reimbursements. But, companies paying through Paypal resulted in a 1099-K that comingled my income and expense reimbursements.

How do I report my income and reimbursements on Schedule C to reconcile my 1099-K? When googling this, I got the following different answers:

**1. Don't report reimbursements:** This is what I ended up doing. I ended up clicking “amount in box 1a is too high” button in Turbotax 1099-K and then put the amount excluding reimbursements. This doesn't feel right because I'm worried that not reporting the full 1099-K amount is an audit risk.

**2. Report reimbursements as income and then deduct them under ""Part V Other Expenses"":** This also doesn't feed right since I would be inconsistent in how I report payments depending on whether they were on the 1099-K or 1099-NEC. Also, isn't having so much ""Other Expenses"" an even greater audit risk? I could put on a single line ""Adjustment for nontaxable reimbursements reported as income on 1099-K"". Or should I list out 100+ individual expenses that I was reimbursed for?

3. Reimbursements count as income and are not deductible.

4. Report reimbursements as income and deduct them under the closest ""Part II Expenses"" category such as meals and parking.

For context, Total payments=$8k, Reimbursements on 1099K=$2k, Standard mileage deduction=$3k

This seems like a grey area with multiple correct answers, but please let me know the best way to do this in the future so I'm less likely to get audited. Thank you for your help.",2024-05-01T17:44:12+00:00
Tax,comment,l24jaot,Prosystems_wizard,,You need to report the full amount of the 1099s as income and deduct the reimbursements as expenses. You could just sum all the expenses to one line “supplies” or break it out as it logically makes sense. There isn’t higher audit risk for deducting “other expenses”.,2024-05-01T18:01:39+00:00

I wouldn't worry about the risk of getting audited.  I would accurately reflect the situation.  I understand dealing with an audit would be stressful and time consuming even if they ultimately conclude you were correct.

I would do the option of reporting what's on the 1099s and deducting the expences.

Will I be able to start applying that to long term capital gains over the 0% tax bracket or will they have to be applied to the 0% portion as well.

I understand how it applies now and in the near future I’m just trying to understand how far a hypothetical amount would go if I had a surplus in retirement. Thank you.",2024-05-01T17:39:51+00:00
Tax,comment,l24i534,wild_b_cat,,"Your losses are netted against gains regardless of tax bracket. Yes, it's possible to have losses that are 'useless' because they only offset gains in the 0% bracket.

Most TLH regimes are meant to offset ordinary income during your working years. It has little benefit in most retirement scenarios.",2024-05-01T17:55:05+00:00
Tax,comment,l24qm46,Guy_called_Al,,"Good to understand these things before retirement.

Note that there are no capital gains/losses on withdrawals from retirement accounts (IRA, 401(k)).  Such withdrawals cannot be applied to capital losses.

If you are carrying over capital losses each year without significant new gains/losses, the net loss is being reduced by $3000 (or $1500 for MFS) against ordinary income.  See Form 1040, Line 7 for negative amount.  This is a better deal (reducing taxable ordinary income) than netting against long term capital gains, IMO.  You cannot defer using the carryover in this manner, nor can you selectively apply those losses to capital gains that fall outside the 0% bracket.  The Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet in the Schedule D instructions is very rigid in the sequence of applying losses and the $3000 deduction to income.

If you have a carryover (or both long-term and short-term carryovers), it's important to fill out Schedule D (or file by software that knows of the carryover) each year to provide the data used in the following year to calculate the actual amount of carry-over.  It's unlikely to be the same each year.  You cannot accurately carryover losses by avoiding Schedule D and ""skipping"" years without capital gains/losses.

Also note that LT cap gains 0% bracket is first filled by other ""ordinary"" income, including Social Security (the taxable part), pension, etc.).  If filing as Single, it only takes $46k of ordinary taxable income to fill up the 0% bracket, and thus start taxing LT gains at 15%.  So the ""0% portion"" might not be a big as you imagine.",2024-05-01T18:43:33+00:00
