They voted to boycott companies complicit in the Israeli settlement industry. That's targeted at an issue, the actions certain Israeli people choose to take - not at an entire people or nationality.

ukpolitics,comment,Israel,f0z8f0x,JabInTheButt,,"I find Netanyahu's government reprehensible, as much as the next rational observer. But I think what people question about this is the blatant picking and choosing of countries to BDS over human rights abuses. Israel is such an easy one - how much do we buy from them on a daily basis? You never hear any suggestions of BDS for China, Pakistan, India, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Myanmar etc etc, countries with equally horrific humans rights abuses.

I don't think whataboutery is usually useful but in this case it is the explanation for why people are so suspicious about these actions. Why are we so focussed on holding Israel to account above other nations? Because they're.... an ally? A parliamentary democracy? So we hold them to a higher standard? I suppose it's plausible but just isn't a really satisfactory answer.

I don't think BDS will be seen as a legitimate tactic of political protest, unless it's applied consistently. If it's acceptable to punish an entire country over the actions of the government which happens to be in charge, that's a reasonable position but it has to be consistent.",2019-09-21T18:02:58+00:00

For all the bad Israel does in the region, it also does some good too.

ukpolitics,comment,Pro-Israel,k66pobm,warriorscot,,"Remarkable how few people read a misleading headline and not the article before they post.

From the article a tweet from the organisers was misrepresented to be islamophobic. This was promoted on social media, likely in part by some bad actors misrepresenting it(which is happening on all sides).

Police did not block the events they advised of the risk and the organisers decided not to do it. A large mixed faith protest went ahead as well as another pro Israel one of the same size this weekend.

Worth noting islamophobic attacks increased several times greater than antisemitic ones over the last two weeks. Pro Palestine protests are also under threat, they simply chose to proceed. In part that limits police resources to protect all of them, hence varying advice on risk to individual groups.

Anyone claiming that they're isn't islamophobia in Jewish communities is being as ridiculous as those claiming the isn't anti semitism in Muslim ones. As a rule the Abrahamic religions don't get along, never have and that counts for the Christian thankfully barely a majority in the UK which is why the bulk of islamophic and anti semitic offences are from the likes of the EDL and other loony toons fascists.

Ultimately however Israel and Palestine is a political argument, it's muddied with religion. But Jews are not Israel and Israel is not Jews, just the same way Islamic State, Iran, Saudi Arabia etc don't represent all Muslims.

Of course this will all be ignored along with the rest of the facts because facts have never really been important in this now multi millenia squabble that's a stain on our species.",2023-10-24T00:51:32+00:00

A ceasefire is exactly what Hamas want, they want time to regroup, replenish their arsenal of rockets and lay traps for Israeli soldiers. Israel will agree to a ceasefire when Hamas return all the hostages and surrender, a ceasefire gives no military benefit to Israel, so why would they agree to one when it will just make achieving the objective of destroying Hamas harder.

Hamas started a war, and in wars people die. Hundreds of thousands of German civilians died in WW2, but for the Allies WW2 was still justified, and killing those civilians in order to defeat the Nazis does not make the Allies the 'bad guys', nor would anyone have called for the allies to agree to a ceasefire without an unconditional surrender from Germany.

This is the same situation, Israel will not agree to let Hamas off the hook, and they will not accept a ceasefire unless Hamas surrenders unconditionally. Calling for one is suggesting that Israel should give in to terrorism, and not hold Hamas accountable for their crimes, both against Israelis and the Palestinians they use as human shields, calling for an unconditional ceasefire suggests that you’re either ignorant to the situation or that you support the terrorists.

If anything, instead of calling for a ceasefire, people who take issue with the manner in which Israel deals with Hamas should be calling for an international coalition to eliminate Hamas. That would satisfy Israel, as their border is secured and the west supports them in the face of terrorism (as it should). But this also means the west can ensure that international law is followed, and gives the west a say in what happens after Hamas is gone. But you don't see calls for this, because Western governments know that they would end up doing exactly what Israel are doing, there is no other way to defeat Hamas, so they don't want to get involved.",2023-10-31T14:35:52+00:00

It seems to me that the political reality at this point is Hamas is the main actor for Palestine and until that changes you cannot support Palestine without then supporting Hamas because, for the time being for the majority of Palestinians, they go hand in hand. 

That doesn’t mean all Palestinians agree but they do appear to be a minority and nor does that mean Israel should just do what it likes…but by the same notion we cant excatly promote to Israel a two party state or call for dialogue with Palestine when they have allowed a group that has set its mission to wipe Israel off the face of the earth to hold such a high degree of influence in Palestine 

Until Palestinians decide for themselves that they would rather some kind of recognition  within a two party state than none.

Depends on the opposition. Opposition to Israel is can be anti-Semitism because there's very thin line separating opposition to the Jewish people based on their race and opposition to policies by the Israeli government based on a moral objection. 

Because Israel is a culturally and ethnically homogeneous ethno-state there's a lot of overlap between government policies and policies that impact Jews directly.

ukpolitics,post,Israel-Palestine War/War,17j2957,yellowbai,Seeing the Israel-Palestine war reminds me what a marvel the Good Friday Agreement is,"- UK made significant concessions that took political courage. Releasing prisoners, amnesty’s, permitting a referendum to give secession to Northern Ireland. Facing down the Unionist intransigence (the DUP rejected the GFA). The Queen shook hands with a man who probably ordered the murder of her uncle. Dismantled the RUC and replaced it with a new police body.  Major had to contest against his own extremists in the Conservative Party. At the time Michale Gove published a paper calling for tanks on the ground and airstrikes in Northern Ireland along with incursions into Ireland.  

- Ireland: changed the Constitution after a referendum and gave up its territorial claim to the 6 Counties which is no small concession to give. There was a reference written into the Constitution claiming the North as lost territory.

- EU: helped via funding and gave a safe forum for back channel discussions to happen with mid level civil servants and diplomats when officially the big bosses couldn’t talk 

- Sinn Fein: didn’t give into the hardliners in the IRA. Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams’s were threatened with assassination and labeled as traitors. Destroyed arms, shook hands with their sworn enemies and tried to run a new state. 

- UUP/SDLP: did a lot to keep the moderate positions viable, got electorally destroyed for taking politically courageous decisions but their legacy is the peace they helped bring about.

- DUP: did sweet fuck all and were dragged kicking and screaming into it and later claimed all the credit. 

The GFA is so successful that it’s taken for granted. Every politician likes to take credit for it today. But it’s pretty much unique in post resolution.

With the agreement, if the nationalist parties ever gain a majority, then they may rightly push for rejoining with Ireland, which the UK should agree with because they helped give the nationalist parties an opportunity to be in the Northern Ireland government because of the agreement. But if the unionist parties have a majority, then Northern Ireland stays a part of the UK, and the nationalists can do little because the people of Northern Ireland want to remain part of the UK.

I think it's very important that UK leadership really did have a high level of commitment to ending the conflict, even for all the part they played in continuing it. And likewise on the other side. Like, Thatcher approved of back-channel negotiations with the IRA, even after they tried to assassinate her. And the IRA approved of back-channel negotiations with the person they were trying to assassinate. That's what I call ruthless pragmatism!

I don't have confidence there is anyone with that level of commitment in power on the Israeli side. I know the Israeli government has, from time to time, made agreements with Hamas. But, for instance, I think that the Israeli government should be 100% committed to an eventual conditional lifting of the Gaza blockade. At least once every year from 2005 on, they should make contact with Hamas with an offer along the lines of, ""We will ease the blockade in ways X, Y, Z, if we can secure commitments A, B, C from you."" The specifics don't matter so much as the fact of being committed to the goal and trying to think up paths to achieve it. And obviously Hamas may reject such an offer out of hand. But to get to the goal, you have to want to get there, even if you think the other guys don't. Now maybe they have been doing all this behind closed doors.

ukpolitics,comment,Israel-Palestine Conflict/Conflict,dyxed8g,haxamin,,"The frontrunner to succeed Heidi Alexander as a Labour MP has withdrawn from the contest after it emerged that she equated the treatment of Palestinians to “Nazi persecution” on Holocaust Memorial Day.

Phyll Opoku-Gyimah, a far-Left supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, claimed that the Israel-Palestine conflict should be considered alongside the systematic extermination of more than six million Jews during the Holocaust.

The Telegraph understands that she was one of several candidates due to be shortlisted by senior Labour officials for the upcoming Lewisham East by-election, which was triggered last week after Ms Alexander quit to join City Hall as the London deputy mayor for transport.

The decision to impose a shortlist of candidates on the local party had enraged Labour members in Lewisham, who claimed that the National Executive Committee had been engaged in a “stitch-up” to ensure a Corbyn-backing candidate was chosen.

It has since emerged that Ms Opoku-Gyimah claimed on Holocaust Memorial Day last year that the treatment of the “Palestinian” should also be remembered alongside other genocides, including in Cambodia, Bosnia and Rwanda and Darfur.”

She was also found to have hired Josh Rivers - who was forced to resign as the Gay Times editor for making anti-Semitic comments-  as a member of UK Black Pride, a group dedicated to promoting BAME rights.

She is the executive director and co-founder.

Mr Rivers stepped down from the role in November last year, after it emerged that he claimed that “Jews are gross” and that Judaism was the only religion which contained the letters “ew”.

He also asked why an actor had been cast as “The Jew” in a production, adding: “I wonder if they cast that guy...because of that f****** ridiculously large honker of a nose”.

Defending her decision to appoint Mr Rivers just months after the controversy, Ms Opoku-Gyimah said: ”Josh apologised unreservedly… UK Black Pride accepts this and we have drawn a line under the matter.”

Withdrawing her candidacy on Sunday, she claimed in a statement that she was pulling out due to an “unexpected family situation”.

She added that it “had forced me to reflect long and hard on whether to put myself forward for considered to be selected as the next Labour Party candidate.”

Her candidacy is likely to alarm Labour moderates, who have called on Mr Corbyn to follow through on his pledge to eradicate anti-Semitism from his party.

Mr Corbyn’s office declined to comment.

A selection meeting due to be held on Wednesday has now been delayed by the National Executive Committee, following anger over the decision to deny local party members the opportunity to choose their candidates.

Acting regional director Neil Fleming said the NEC had taken the decision “after listening to feedback from members and in a desire to ensure members get more time to consider who our candidate should be once the shortlist is published”.

Ian McKenzie, chair of the local party, had written to members urging them to complain to the party’s headquarters to oppose a timetable for selection, which gave them just six days to choose a candidate.

The seat is a Labour stronghold, with Ms Alexander increasing her majority to 21,000 in the 2017 election.

It came as Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow general attorney, demanded that Ken Livingstone be thrown out of the Labour Party.

Appearing on the BBC’s Sunday Politics, Ms Chakrabarti said it was “completely unacceptable” to readmit Mr Livingstone into Labour following his  “incendiary remarks”.

A Labour spokesman refused to say whether a date for Mr Livingstone’s disciplinary hearing had been confirmed when approached last night.",2018-05-13T21:15:27+00:00

No, they killed the Head of Intelligence for the PLO, who Mossad claim was involved in the Munich Massacre, a claim for which there is no proof and Mossad have never provided or commented on there being any proof. 

If you actually want to know the facts of that assassination then read this WP piece from 92:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/07/10/assassination-of-plo-aide-raises-many-questions/c482bb3e-a437-474d-9835-421397ce87bf/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.87545e042fdb

Even at the time the idea of Bseiso being involved in the Munich Massacre didn't seem credible to US intelligence or French intelligence.

It seems far more likely he was assassinated because he was secretly working with US intelligence, which would mirror the killing of Salameh who was also a secret liaison for the PLO with US intelligence. ",2018-08-11T12:31:19+00:00

ukpolitics,post,Palestine Liberation Organization,17gzq03,BoboftheDead84,Ed Davey's statement on Israel - Hama's conflict,"Friend, I was horrified to wake up on 7th October to the awful terrorist attacks in Israel, which we have condemned unequivocally. I have been heartbroken and dismayed to see the scenes of violence in Israel and Palestine over the past two and a half weeks.

It is hard to watch the news right now. We continue to hear reports of the brutal terrorism of Hamas, which still holds more than 200 Israelis hostage in Gaza. And now we have a situation in Gaza which is frankly devastating. The 2.2 million residents of the Gaza Strip, over half of whom are children, are hurtling towards a humanitarian catastrophe. It is horrifying.

Liberal Democrats are clear: it is vital that essential supplies like food, water and medicine get to innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza, in line with international law. It is also of the utmost importance that the hostages - among whose number includes children as young as nine months old - are immediately and unconditionally released.

We support Israel’s right to protect its citizens and target these brutal terrorists Hamas, in line with international law. We are clear that innocent Palestinians must not pay the price for the atrocities of Hamas. And we affirm that the world has a duty to prevent needless civilian deaths.

That’s why, over the weekend, we declared our support for a temporary humanitarian ceasefire, in order to bring about a pause in hostilities. We need the space for an intense period of diplomacy, to get humanitarian aid into Gaza, and to provide an opportunity to realise the release of the hostages.

In the House of Commons earlier this week, I asked the Prime Minister to support our call.

You can watch my question here: https://x.com/LibDems/status/1717545612390862915?s=20

We were not alone when we called for a humanitarian ceasefire. Others, like the Archbishop of Canterbury, had already done so. And in the days since, there has been some movement within the international community and within the UK. Both the Government and the Labour Party now call for what they term a ‘humanitarian pause’. But there is further to go.

We are clear that the people of Israel and Palestine have a right to live free from fear. The thing that will ultimately give them the security which they deserve - the security which will prevent the sort of scenes which we have seen over the past days - is to finally bring about the two state solution, and a lasting peace.

Liberal Democrats are the party of internationalism and international law. We have long advocated for a two state solution, and we will continue to do so.

Best wishes,

Ed Davey

ukpolitics,post,Palestine Liberation Organization,971ew2,GuessImStuckWithThis,Who is the the PLO member that Corbyn is alleged to have laid a wreath for?,"So Corbyn claims that he paid his respects at the grave of a PLO member who was assassinated in Paris by Mossad agents. If this is true, then this grave would be for Atef Bseiso, who was assassinated in Paris in 1992 and is buried at the location Corbyn was photographed by.

I hadn't any idea who this guy was, so this is what I have been able to gather about him online:

>Bsesio was the Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO) liaison officer with foreign intelligence agencies. He was assassinated in Paris in 1992.

>He was a member of Black September, the organization from which the Olympic attackers were recruited

>He was on Mossad's list of assassination targets until 1988, when he was taken off the list.

>He was then secretly put back on the list by Shabtai Shavit, the director of Missed

>Prior to his assassination he was working with the CIA to share intelligence information with Western countries on terrorist operations hostile to Western interests

>After his assassination the CIA agent Robert Baer, one of those officials he was to meet the following day, stated that one primary reason for Mossad's killing of Bseiso was to block the growing international recognition of the PLO arising in part from the organization's links with key Western intelligence agencies. 

>The French were also furious that Mossad had performed a targeted assassination on French soil, and began to crack down on Mossad infrastructure and operations in that country. 

>The assassination was also at a time when Israel and the PLO were close to a rapprochement, and we're secretly negotiating the Oslo accords. Mossad had been kept in the dark about these secret talks, but were aware of them due to a mole within the PLO and a wiretap of Mohammed Abbas's phone.

PoliticsUK,comment,Israel,kseaoh6,lfdfq,,"There's some context required, about parliamentary process.

A 'normal' day would have e.g. the Government table (propose) a motion, opposition parties table amendments. On the day, the motion and amendments must be 'moved', i.e. given time for debate. The speaker is the one who selects amendments (Standing Order 32), and calls members to 'move' them for debate. At the closure of the debate, the amendments would be voted upon first, and then finally the motion 'as amended' would be voted on.

This alone would mean that backbenchers and opposition parties would never get to make law, so there are these Private Member bills that allow non-Government MPs to table bills, but these are rare and the usual process random (literally a lottery).

To ensure that the opposition parties are guaranteed their chance to move motions and bills, 20 days of the session are put aside as ""Opposition Days"" (under SO14, with 17 days for the Official Opposition which is currently Labour, and 3 days for the second largest Opposition, which is currently the SNP) where the main process is reversed: the opposition put forward motions, and the Government tables amendments. SO31 prescribes what happens to amendments on those days.

Specifically, Standing Order 31(2)(a) says that if a Minister of the Crown moved (proposed and speaker selected) an amendment, the question should not be on the amendment but on 'That the original words stand part of the question', i.e. that the motion/bill is voted on first. This ensures that the Government can't just pass amendments that replace substantially (or wholly) the text of the original motion with whatever the Government wishes, at least before the House has an opportunity to vote on the original text of the opposition motion. The amendment should also be put forthwith, that is, without debate or chance of further amendment (Erskine May 25th Edition, Part 3, Chapter 20, Paragraph 20.45). Basically, this ensures that on those days, the House will actually have a chance to vote on what the opposition proposes, without it being torn up by earlier amendments by bigger parties first.

Since SO31(2)(a) makes no mention of amendments moved by a person other than a Minister of the Crown (excepting that they cannot be moved after a Minister of the Crown has moved theirs), the convention is that the Speaker should not select other (either backbench government MPs or opposition parties) amendments, as SO31(2)(a) would not apply, and therefore those amendments would be debated and voted on before the main question, and meaning the House might never get a chance to vote on the original words of the motion at all, in effect defeating the purpose of SO31(2)(a).

However, this is only convention, and selecting Opposition amendments on Opposition days is not unheard of. Erskine May has a relevant footnote for this in Part 3, Chapter 20, Paragraph 20.35 (""Form of questions proposed on amendments"") which says that where amendments are moved on opposition days by someone other than a Minister of the Crown, the question shall be 'That the amendment be made', as is customary, and as happened 3 Feb 2016, during the Public Finances: Scotland debate on a Labour opposition day, where the SNP put an amendment, and it was voted on first (see Hansard for transcript [https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-02-03/debates/16020363000002/PublicFinancesScotland](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-02-03/debates/16020363000002/PublicFinancesScotland), and there are many other examples of Opposition amendments to Opposition day motions, obviously with many different contexts).

A procedural mistake was probably made, as it was an Opposition day, and a Minister of the Crown tabled an amendment, but said amendment was never moved (it was only to be moved if the opposition amendment was rejected), and the original words of the motion was never voted upon, either. There was probably some other order of operations that things could have been performed in to have allowed the House to vote on the original words of the Opposition motion, to have allowed the other opposition amendment to be voted on, and still allow the Government amendment to have been voted on (presumably, in that order?).

The Speaker contends that those conventions around SO31(2) are outdated, and simply reduce the options that could be put to the House. The House is free to, and regularly does, amend the Standing Orders. e.g. to amend SO31(2), or add a (c) section to SO31(2) defining the process for Opposition amendments on Opposition days, if they so wished (e.g. requiring all moved amendments to be voted on after the main motion, or requiring the Speaker to not select amendments from any person other than a Minister of the Crown on an Opposition day). In the end, SO147 establishes a Procedure Committee whom can make such recommendations. So perhaps we will see these conventions change.

\[I tried to keep this impartial, and give just the explanation of what actually happened and what the practicalities are; if I've made mistakes, please do correct me. A lot of the rhetoric I've seen is highly political, and doesn't really consider the underlying process at all, and seems to me, mostly trying to wield conventions as a weapon rather than actually explaining or understanding them.\]",2024-02-27T16:43:38+00:00
PoliticsUK,comment,Israel,kuiapfl,gjksnp23,,"Hi, I think Lindsay Hoyles departure f rom normal parliamentary customs was the wrong choice. It was the SNP's Opposition Day and they get very few a year so it was extremely unfair for the motion of the SNP's not to be debated solely. 
Lindsay Hoyles decision to debate all 3 amendments so their could be a full discussion on all 3 amendments from Labour and Conservatives was wrong on 2.points.
One - as I said it was the SNPs discussion opposition day and it was up to them what topic they wanted to discuss 
Second - if Labour told The Speaker that if he didn't allow all amendments to be voted on because of ""security fears to MPs"" is giving in to terrorism or intimidation by allowing their tiny minority of voices change how parliament works. MPs get threatened ALL the time which is despicable and shameful. But you can't help feeling that the way they play culture wars in parliament by picking and using dog whistle politics constantly going on about the 30,000 illegal asylum seekers and refugees while trying to distract us from the 1.3 million legal immigrants they have let in with visas in last  years alone, while only building 120-130,000 houses a year. Where are they meant to live. It's the Tories policies that are causing house price inflation and rent inflation to occur as the people that come in legally can afford to pay the exorbitant rent increases and house prices as they have to earn more than the average wage meaning someone earning £15-25000 has no chance of getting a roof over their head especially since the Tories have not kept the Local Housing Allowance in line with inflation meaning Councils cannot afford to top up working people who claim LHA because their wages are not enough to pay their rent, children, food,  clothes, phone, cable TV (which in today's day and age is a necessity) or never take children on holidays. It's even worse if you're unemployed and you do not want to be at the bottom and be disabled or unfit for work then you really know hardship and poverty.
If politicians can't act recently and show the country a position way of having debates instead of shouting, being controlled by the whips unable to stand up for what their constituency wants them to vote for but instead go F**k them I've got to vote howthe whips tell me or I'm not going to climb the greasy pole. 
Letting the threat of violence from outside has set a precedent in the protesters minds who will think if we threaten more, if we act more vile and unacceptable, fire bomb and vandalise MPs offices, etc then they will be able to change MPs votes and how Parliament runs it's business. It's like a Darwinian war where the strong can squash the weak and the louder they shout the more intimidated the MPs will be and bend to their will. That is not how democracies are meant to work. We are becoming more like the USA and soon they'll be happy to storm parliament, vandalise and threaten MPs personal safety unless their is a ""panic room"" that is totally secure and impregnable.

Tories constantly going on about Trans issues which only 0.3% are Trans and what problems are they causing 99% of the  population? I go about and Trans issues have never come up as a problem. I've met a few Trans men and women but instead of them causing problems Zi just say Hi, how are you?

Two reasons. One, because Hoyle brought it up as a reason for the break in tradition. And two, because the far-right ran with it and started saying ludicrous things like ""London has fallen to Islam"" and similar mindless guff.",2024-02-25T15:46:20+00:00
PoliticsUK,comment,Gaza,kseaoh6,lfdfq,,"There's some context required, about parliamentary process.

A 'normal' day would have e.g. the Government table (propose) a motion, opposition parties table amendments. On the day, the motion and amendments must be 'moved', i.e. given time for debate. The speaker is the one who selects amendments (Standing Order 32), and calls members to 'move' them for debate. At the closure of the debate, the amendments would be voted upon first, and then finally the motion 'as amended' would be voted on.

This alone would mean that backbenchers and opposition parties would never get to make law, so there are these Private Member bills that allow non-Government MPs to table bills, but these are rare and the usual process random (literally a lottery).

To ensure that the opposition parties are guaranteed their chance to move motions and bills, 20 days of the session are put aside as ""Opposition Days"" (under SO14, with 17 days for the Official Opposition which is currently Labour, and 3 days for the second largest Opposition, which is currently the SNP) where the main process is reversed: the opposition put forward motions, and the Government tables amendments. SO31 prescribes what happens to amendments on those days.

Specifically, Standing Order 31(2)(a) says that if a Minister of the Crown moved (proposed and speaker selected) an amendment, the question should not be on the amendment but on 'That the original words stand part of the question', i.e. that the motion/bill is voted on first. This ensures that the Government can't just pass amendments that replace substantially (or wholly) the text of the original motion with whatever the Government wishes, at least before the House has an opportunity to vote on the original text of the opposition motion. The amendment should also be put forthwith, that is, without debate or chance of further amendment (Erskine May 25th Edition, Part 3, Chapter 20, Paragraph 20.45). Basically, this ensures that on those days, the House will actually have a chance to vote on what the opposition proposes, without it being torn up by earlier amendments by bigger parties first.

Since SO31(2)(a) makes no mention of amendments moved by a person other than a Minister of the Crown (excepting that they cannot be moved after a Minister of the Crown has moved theirs), the convention is that the Speaker should not select other (either backbench government MPs or opposition parties) amendments, as SO31(2)(a) would not apply, and therefore those amendments would be debated and voted on before the main question, and meaning the House might never get a chance to vote on the original words of the motion at all, in effect defeating the purpose of SO31(2)(a).

However, this is only convention, and selecting Opposition amendments on Opposition days is not unheard of. Erskine May has a relevant footnote for this in Part 3, Chapter 20, Paragraph 20.35 (""Form of questions proposed on amendments"") which says that where amendments are moved on opposition days by someone other than a Minister of the Crown, the question shall be 'That the amendment be made', as is customary, and as happened 3 Feb 2016, during the Public Finances: Scotland debate on a Labour opposition day, where the SNP put an amendment, and it was voted on first (see Hansard for transcript [https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-02-03/debates/16020363000002/PublicFinancesScotland](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-02-03/debates/16020363000002/PublicFinancesScotland), and there are many other examples of Opposition amendments to Opposition day motions, obviously with many different contexts).

A procedural mistake was probably made, as it was an Opposition day, and a Minister of the Crown tabled an amendment, but said amendment was never moved (it was only to be moved if the opposition amendment was rejected), and the original words of the motion was never voted upon, either. There was probably some other order of operations that things could have been performed in to have allowed the House to vote on the original words of the Opposition motion, to have allowed the other opposition amendment to be voted on, and still allow the Government amendment to have been voted on (presumably, in that order?).

The Speaker contends that those conventions around SO31(2) are outdated, and simply reduce the options that could be put to the House. The House is free to, and regularly does, amend the Standing Orders. e.g. to amend SO31(2), or add a (c) section to SO31(2) defining the process for Opposition amendments on Opposition days, if they so wished (e.g. requiring all moved amendments to be voted on after the main motion, or requiring the Speaker to not select amendments from any person other than a Minister of the Crown on an Opposition day). In the end, SO147 establishes a Procedure Committee whom can make such recommendations. So perhaps we will see these conventions change.

\[I tried to keep this impartial, and give just the explanation of what actually happened and what the practicalities are; if I've made mistakes, please do correct me. A lot of the rhetoric I've seen is highly political, and doesn't really consider the underlying process at all, and seems to me, mostly trying to wield conventions as a weapon rather than actually explaining or understanding them.\]",2024-02-27T16:43:38+00:00
PoliticsUK,comment,Gaza,kuiapfl,gjksnp23,,"Hi, I think Lindsay Hoyles departure f rom normal parliamentary customs was the wrong choice. It was the SNP's Opposition Day and they get very few a year so it was extremely unfair for the motion of the SNP's not to be debated solely. 
Lindsay Hoyles decision to debate all 3 amendments so their could be a full discussion on all 3 amendments from Labour and Conservatives was wrong on 2.points.
One - as I said it was the SNPs discussion opposition day and it was up to them what topic they wanted to discuss 
Second - if Labour told The Speaker that if he didn't allow all amendments to be voted on because of ""security fears to MPs"" is giving in to terrorism or intimidation by allowing their tiny minority of voices change how parliament works. MPs get threatened ALL the time which is despicable and shameful. But you can't help feeling that the way they play culture wars in parliament by picking and using dog whistle politics constantly going on about the 30,000 illegal asylum seekers and refugees while trying to distract us from the 1.3 million legal immigrants they have let in with visas in last  years alone, while only building 120-130,000 houses a year. Where are they meant to live. It's the Tories policies that are causing house price inflation and rent inflation to occur as the people that come in legally can afford to pay the exorbitant rent increases and house prices as they have to earn more than the average wage meaning someone earning £15-25000 has no chance of getting a roof over their head especially since the Tories have not kept the Local Housing Allowance in line with inflation meaning Councils cannot afford to top up working people who claim LHA because their wages are not enough to pay their rent, children, food,  clothes, phone, cable TV (which in today's day and age is a necessity) or never take children on holidays. It's even worse if you're unemployed and you do not want to be at the bottom and be disabled or unfit for work then you really know hardship and poverty.
If politicians can't act recently and show the country a position way of having debates instead of shouting, being controlled by the whips unable to stand up for what their constituency wants them to vote for but instead go F**k them I've got to vote howthe whips tell me or I'm not going to climb the greasy pole. 
Letting the threat of violence from outside has set a precedent in the protesters minds who will think if we threaten more, if we act more vile and unacceptable, fire bomb and vandalise MPs offices, etc then they will be able to change MPs votes and how Parliament runs it's business. It's like a Darwinian war where the strong can squash the weak and the louder they shout the more intimidated the MPs will be and bend to their will. That is not how democracies are meant to work. We are becoming more like the USA and soon they'll be happy to storm parliament, vandalise and threaten MPs personal safety unless their is a ""panic room"" that is totally secure and impregnable.

Tories constantly going on about Trans issues which only 0.3% are Trans and what problems are they causing 99% of the  population? I go about and Trans issues have never come up as a problem. I've met a few Trans men and women but instead of them causing problems Zi just say Hi, how are you? Etc, It must of been a very hard thing to come out in the current climate when people obsessed with Trans issues usually live in echo chambers and are filled with misinformationn. I ask if it has been a hard journey and if possible ask what it feels like being trapped in the wrong body?

Britons have just realised that they need to deal with illegal immigration. It has taken you a few years, but better later than never. I would like to ask, as an Israeli Jew (who loves Britain very much. I don't miss the Mandate, though), what the British people – the natives – think about the ongoing situation in Britain.

Do you support more immigration or regulations and deportation? Would you less Islam in your country (or maybe more Islam)? How do you feel about what's happened at the Elizabeth Tower?

I would also like to ask how you feel about the fact according to which white Brits are now a minority is their own capital city.

How do you feel about [councils](https://youtu.be/aEXUYbXx3NQ?si=LZYC0sGbCoKLXDPA) which would like to change your laws? What about these [protests](https://youtu.be/r3BZPnoKum8?si=po1NJajSgfYewLxp)?

I'd also like to mention the Mayor of London and the FM of Scotland, which were democratically elected, and it might give me an answer to my questions. You might call me a racist, but I don't know how I'd react if an Arab Muslim got elected as the Mayor of Jerusalem (the same as I don't expect a Jew to become the Mayor of Ankara or any other Muslim capital city).

Deportation of whom? We already deport illegal immigrants where it's reasonable to do so.

> Would you less Islam in your country (or maybe more Islam)? 

Couldn't care less. Religions are poisonous, but the vilification of Islam and trying to ostracise Muslims - what the far-right want to do - doesn't make things better.

Your post is based largely on this division, and you set the idea that we're only just getting around to dealing with it. This promotes the idea that its a new problem,  when it clearly isn't.

PoliticsUK,comment,Protest,krugvgh,HopeDefiant4933,,"Some background: I am 38, a born and raised Londoner. I am white, but my grandfather was an Ashkenazi Jew, and while I am not Jewish myself, my last name is, and I have Jewish family members. Like many Britons, I don't have to go that far back to find immigrants in my family. I am raising my two sons in Zone 2/3 London, and I've lived here all my life, save for 3 years at university.  
Before I answer, I want to say that I am always very conscious that our media diet massively impacts our perception of immigration, race relations, crime, etc. I have seen media, mostly associated with the right-wing, portraying my city as 'Londonistan' or crime-ridden. I do not recognize this characterization at all.  
The last 10 years of social media have taught us that outrage and anger appear to engage us much more than understanding and compassion. I've seen media coverage of protests which focuses on the very worst attendees only (this is what drives clicks, comments, and shares). I have had friends who have joined protests about what is happening in Gaza right now, and they've been immensely disappointed that the media coverage reflects nothing of 99% of attendees who protested peacefully and respectfully. I understand why some people say 'London is finished' if all they see is a twisted version designed to antagonize.  
The London Mayor is a born and raised Londoner like me. He's been elected by Londoners twice, and I believe he will be elected a third time. He has worked so hard at seeking to build community relations and has been a staunch ally of London Jews and has spoken out vocally against antisemitism where he has observed it. I believe far too much is made of the fact he happens to be a Muslim. As a humanist myself, I do not care what made-up being in the sky you pray to, God, Allah, Shiva - why should I prefer one to another? We have Islamic fundamentalists in the UK. We have Christian fundamentalists in the UK (many more in the US). We have Jewish fundamentalists in Israel. Personally, it's not the flavor of fundamentalism that bothers me; it's the fundamentalism, fundamentally.  
It depresses me that people look at matters so superficially. The previous Labour Mayor of London has, in many people's opinions, made some grossly offensive comments about British Jews and the history of the Holocaust. Yet, as a white man, he was attacked a fraction of the time Sadiq Khan, who, as I have said, is blameless in this regard in my own opinion.  
I love London. It has always been multicultural during my life. And I always note it is precisely in areas where there is a greater variety of races, ethnicities, and faiths that the far right, anti-migrant voices are weakest. It's in the white enclaves and seaside towns where the locals rarely make any real connection with non-white people where they are easily fooled into thinking there is something to fear from people with superficial differences from them.  
The people of color and different faiths I have met all love, laugh, fear, cry, worry, rejoice, learn, and grow the same. Most Londoners know this. A lot of us get tired of being told by outsiders that it is not the case when we see it for ourselves every day.

I'm not trying to sell our country short because for a small island, we've certainly punched well above our weight and used all the natural resources at our disposal - being an island made us very dependent on navy development for example.

As for other, more racial elements, whiteness is a relatively recent identity because throughout our history we've been just as focussed on discriminating against other white people who weren't english. For example, imagine how a northern Irish (or irish when we owned it) prime minister might have been reacted to or a catholic head of state since Henry the 8th.

Less than 7% of the population across the UK profess Islam. The feeling that there are so many Muslims is mainly relate to the fact that they are concentrated in some borough of London (about 30% in those with the highest concentration). The largest Muslim group (according to official stats) is Pakistani, a commonwealth county which has a fast-track lane to gain the right to live in the UK. So all this talking about feeling invaded by desperate human beings fleeing from wars or dictatorships is a bit of a none-sense. 

There are international human rights to grant asylum to specific categories of immigrants, many others are already denied entry.

Another point is, who is a native Briths? If a child is born in the UK is a British citizen and has the same right as any other citizen regardless of its religion or colour.

I am a non-native British who lived in LOndon for the last 15 years. 15 years ago, the problem were the Poles, then the European Union, now Muslim immigrants.

Here's a link which will help you understand the breadth of meanings of ""river to the sea"". It doesn't exclusively refer to calling for a one-state solution, there are Palestinians in the West Bank, internationally recognized Israel, and Gaza - these are geographically from the river to the sea.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/21/its-simply-a-call-for-freedom-marchers-defend-contentious-slogan-at-london-palestine-protest

I also don't understand why you and others have suddenly decided that a one-state solution is outside of the overtone window. It is not so in Israel, even though it less popular than two state and indefinite occupation.

-

>The bodies of a British mum and her two teenage daughters were found ""cuddled together"" after they were all killed by Hamas militants on October 7.

>Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters Noiya, 16, and Yahel, 13, were killed when militants stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel. In a chilling last text, the Bristol-born mum-of-two told worried family members: ""I can hear them. They are here at our house. They are shooting and shouting 'Die Israel'. Please call for help.""

>The woman's parents, Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a ""devoted mother"" who ""tried to protect her daughters to the end"". They added: ""Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms."" Mrs Brisley said knowing that the three women died holding each other was ""a small comfort"", adding she hopes they did not suffer and it was ""a quick death"".

>The heartbroken parents, who live in Bridgend, Wales, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren, with Mrs Brisley saying: ""Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us."" She added Lianne was a ""wonderful"" person and said that Israel was a ""very friendly"" and ""a lovely place to bring up a family"".

>They said they became worried when they first saw the news of the October 7 attack on TV. Mr Brisley explained: ""I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response. I think by then she had already gone. Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in. Everybody on the street was killed or badly injured.""

>Lianne met her husband Eli in Israel after she first went to stay on a kibbutz aged just 19. The pair were married in Britain, going on to have daughters Yehal and Noiya together who were British citizens. They lived in the Kibbutz Be’eri, near the border with Gaza in the south of Israel and were used to rocket attacks. However, their shocked family said nothing could have prepared them for the attack on October 7 which unfolded via a flurry of chilling texts and phone calls.

>Relative Raz Matalon said: ""Early on Saturday morning when Hamas fired all the missiles at Israel we called Eli and Lianne and other members of the family, like we always do. Lianne told us this was not like a usual missile attack. It was different. She said she had heard shooting and hand grenades exploding and that the noise of gunfire was getting closer. Then she said: 'We have to be quiet because they are near.’""

>At least 1,400 Israelis were killed in the Hamas attack when gunmen infiltrated communities near the Gaza Strip. The latest official figures from Palestine show that 8,306 people have been killed and 21,048 have been wounded in Gaza since October 7.

unitedkingdom,comment,Israel-Palestine,k6e3rwf,tylersburden,,"In 2014, Hamas brutally killed 23 pro peace Palestinians. 

>Many of these unlawful killings were publicly billed as attacks against people assisting Israel during the July and August 2014 conflict as part of an operation, codenamed “Strangling Necks”, to target “collaborators”. However, in reality, at least 16 of those executed had been in Hamas custody since before the conflict broke out. Many had been awaiting the outcome of their trials when they were taken away from prison and summarily executed.

>Hamas forces also abducted, tortured or attacked members and supporters of Fatah, their main rival political organization within Gaza, including former members of the Palestinian Authority security forces. Not a single person has been held accountable for the crimes committed by Hamas forces against Palestinians during the 2014 conflict, indicating that these crimes were either ordered or condoned by the authorities.

>“Instead of upholding justice, the Hamas authorities and leadership have continuously encouraged and facilitated these appalling crimes against powerless individuals. Their failure to even condemn the unlawful killings, abduction and torture of perceived suspects leaves them effectively with blood on their hands,” said Philip Luther. 

>Atta Najjar, a former police officer under the Palestinian Authority who has a mental disability, was serving a 15-year prison term imposed by a military court after he was arrested in 2009 and subsequently convicted of “collaborating” with Israel. On 22 August 2014, he was taken out from the prison and executed. 

>“There were marks of torture and bullet shots on his body. His arms and legs were broken… his body was as if you’d put it in a bag and smashed it… His body was riddled with about 30 bullets. He had slaughter marks around his neck, marks of knives… And from behind the head – there was no brain. Empty… It was difficult for us to carry him… He was heavy, like when you put meat in a bag; no bones. His bones were smashed. They broke him in the prison,” said his brother, who retrieved the body from al-Shifa hospital morgue on 22 August 2014. 

>As well as carrying out unlawful killings, others abducted by Hamas were subjected to torture, including severe beatings with truncheons, gun butts, hoses and wire or held in stress positions. Some were interrogated and tortured or otherwise ill-treated in a disused outpatient’s clinic within the grounds of Gaza City’s main al-Shifa hospital. At least three people arrested during the conflict accused of “collaboration” died in custody.

>“Hamas forces have displayed a disregard for the most fundamental rules of international humanitarian law. Torture and cruel treatment of detainees in an armed conflict is a war crime. Extrajudicial executions are also war crimes. The de facto administration in Gaza must send a message to all law enforcement forces to treat prisoners humanely at all times. All allegations of extrajudicial execution and torture must be impartially and independently investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice in fair trials,” said Philip Luther.

-

>The Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem has warned the ‘UK has a big problem on its hands’ as she said anti-Semitism is on the rise globally after an ‘anti-Israeli mob’ stormed Dagestan airport on the weekend. 

>A plane from Tel Aviv to the Russian Republic of Dagestan was forced to land at an alternate airport on Sunday after a ‘mob hunting for Jews’ stormed it.

>The mobs later targeted Makhachkala airport, where the plane was diverted to, after it was reported that was where it would land.

>After footage shared online showed swathes of men running into Makhachkala airport, with some heard shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’, Jerusalem’s deputy mayor has warned ""Europe is the next stop"" for anti-Semitism.

>Fleur Hassan-Nahoum, the Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem, told LBC's Nick Ferrari at Breakfast: ""I don't think we'd ever imagine that in 2023 we would see a modern day pogrom happening in Russia with the Muslim community of Dagestan.”

>She continued: “Unfortunately we’re seeing this now develop in all the major capital cities and what you have to ask yourself is: who are the police protecting?”

>“We’re the first stop on the tour of global Jihad.

>""Europe is the next stop and I think the UK has a big problem on its hands”.

>Videos shared online showed crowds breaking through doors at the airport terminal while swathes of others stormed the runway of the airport.

>Passengers on board the plane from Tel Aviv were instructed to remain inside after landing, as police moved in to protect them.

>Police arrested 60 people following the outbreak, while 20 people were injured, and two have been left in critical condition.

>Ms Hassan-Nahoum added: ""It's just very sad because it's not just in Chechnya, in Dagestan, but we've seen it in the streets of London unfortunately as well.

>""100,000 people shouting 'from the river to the sea' which means the annihilation of the State of Israel - many people shouting 'death to the Jews'.

>""So I don't think this problem of the rising anti-Semitism is solely in Russia, it really is in every capital in the world right now.""

>It comes after thousands of pro-Palestine protesters gathered in the streets of London on Saturday for the second weekend in a row.

>Shouts of “stop arming Israel. Stop bombing Gaza” were heard. While some were also heard chanting “from the river to the sea” - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean.

>More than 1,000 Metropolitan Police were deployed across London amid the protests.

>Nine arrests were made, including some which are being treated as suspected hate crimes.

>The Met police faced backlash from the government following the first weekend of protests after officers concluded a chant of ‘Jihad’ was lawful.

>Reacting to online footage of the events in Makhachkala, X users expressed their concern, as one wrote: “I pray for you and the safety of your people.”

>“I can't believe this stuff is happening and I am so sorry you personally have to deal with all this grief. Unreal. Stay strong, this is just horrendous,” another added.

>Russian state-owned RIA Novosti outlet reported that the airport was forced to close due to riots taking place.

>""Israel expects the Russian authorities to protect all Israeli citizens and all Jews, and to act decisively against the rioters and against incitement to violence against Jews and Israelis,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said after the incident.

>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has issued a statement as he said the mob's actions are ""not an isolated incident...but part of Russia's widespread culture of hatred towards other nations"".

>""Appalling videos from Makhachkala, Russia, where an angry mob broke into the airport searching for Israeli citizens on the flight from Tel-Aviv,"" he said.

>""This is not an isolated incident in Makhachkala, but rather part of Russia’s widespread culture of hatred toward other nations, which is propagated by state television, pundits, and authorities.

>""The Russian foreign minister has made a series of antisemitic remarks in the last year. The Russian President also used antisemitic slurs. For Russian propaganda talking heads on official television, hate rhetoric is routine.

>""Even the most recent Middle East escalation prompted antisemitic statements from Russian ideologists. Russian antisemitism and hatred toward other nations are systemic and deeply rooted.

> When Musheir El-Farra climbs into bed in Gaza each night, he cannot get the sounds of people screaming out of his head.

> Since last week, the British civil engineer has been plagued by memories of an Israeli bomb attack on a residential block in Khan Younis in which, he said, 16 of his relatives were killed.

> “Every time I go to bed I can see them, and I’m saying to myself: ‘Is there going to be more?’ Every night. Every night I can hear those screams, those wails,” he said.

> El-Farra said the “massacre” was 10 metres from the house he was sheltering in, and that he now knows more than 100 people who have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its aerial bombardment and ground operation.

> Describing the aftermath of the attack in the early hours of the morning last Tuesday, he said: “I saw the body of my beloved cousin, a boy I’ve loved since he was a kid, called Hatim, in front of me, on his back, with his backside exposed and we put a blanket on him.

> “I saw the body of his son who was thrown from the third floor into the back yard in front of our house. I saw the body of two of the babies who were killed in that massacre.

> “I saw an old woman who was severely injured being carried by our relatives. I saw them all being taken to ambulances and I saw mutilated bodies. I saw all this at a metre’s distance.

> “To be honest I’m really worried about PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] when I go back to Britain – if I go back to Britain.”

> El-Farra, 62, who grew up in Gaza and now lives in Sheffield, is among the 200 British or dual nationals in the Palestinian territory. More than 8,000 people in the strip have been killed, according to the Gaza health ministry, since Hamas’s brutal attacks in Israel on 7 October. Hamas militants rampaged through southern Israel, killing 1,400 people and taking 230 hostages.

> On Sunday, El-Farra and his nephew Mohammed Ghalayini, a civil servant from Manchester who is also trapped in Khan Younis, were able to reassure their loved ones of their safety after the lifting of a 36-hour near-total communications blackout imposed by Israel.

> “It was very scary to be cut off like that, to feel like you really, truly have no voice while you’re undergoing this onslaught from the Israeli army,” said Ghalayini, 44.

> But the bombardment has not eased. “A couple of minutes before you called the house really shook like an earthquake, like it swayed from side to side for a second,” he said on Sunday evening.

> “It’s all around you. You can’t walk anywhere without seeing some signs of bombing, whether it’s buildings or debris or cars that have windows shattered or massive dents or people, the walking wounded, walking around with bandages on their heads or with broken limbs and it’s like, wow, these are people that have just escaped from bombing.”

> Ghalayini and El-Farra, who is chair of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign in Sheffield, said they had no power and struggled to charge their phones, and that water and food was scarce, with 12-hour queues to buy bread.

> El-Farra, who is sheltering in a three-storey block with his UK-born son Qasem, 21, and four other families, added that it was shocking to see evacuees from northern Gaza sleeping on cardboard boxes on pavements in the centre of Khan Younis.

> He has been documenting on social media the horrors of Israel’s bombardment, which he described as “collective punishment on a massive, massive scale [and] a war crime under international law”.

> But he was keen to stress that there had been some glimpses of hope amid the brutality. “It’s unbelievable; we get bombed one night and the following day the market and the high street and people are trying to get back to life,” he said.

> “I have seen people going into bird supplies shops and buying food for their birds. I took a video and I was crying because this is a great sign, like how on earth in an area which has been bombed people think of their birds and shops open for the people.”

> He added that this was also evidence that Palestinians had become somewhat immune to such suffering. “I am sad for how they’re not feeling the pain as much as they do because they are used to it, although this is the most vicious attack according to everybody,” El-Farra said.

> “But I’m proud as well because this is a sign of strength – although it shouldn’t be, human beings should be scared and people are scared, terrified – but there’s a sense of togetherness and strength and that’s fantastic.”

> Despite their fears for their safety, Ghalayini and El-Farra said they had considered staying in Gaza to help with the relief effort.

> Ghalayini, who was born in Saudi Arabia but moved to the UK when he was a one-year-old, said: “I’m a skilled individual, I’m organised, I’m fluent in English and articulate. I can be a voice, I can be a witness, I can help people get through this. Civilians in war are seen as victims, but I’m not a victim. I am someone who wants to support the community through this.”

> El-Farra added: “I’m among my people, and what affects them, affects me and I feel that, even if I leave, my heart will be bleeding for the people left behind.”

unitedkingdom,comment,Israel-Palestine,k7l0e7k,tylersburden,,"So this is darkly fascinating. In 2015, Jeremy Corbyn was trying to become Labour leader. Plenty of people criticised him. A few praised him. 

One of the people that did praise him was the then deputy foreign minister in the Hamas terrorist group, Ghazi Hamad. He said that [""I find that he has very good sympathy and support for the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian struggle and he is frankly against the occupation, against the racist policy of Israel, against settlements"".](https://archive.ph/N619d#selection-2045.0-2045.206) 

Quite the praise. 

Since then, Ghazi Hamad has become the official spokesman of the Hamas Terrorist Group that form the Palestine government. [In a video on social media released yesterday](https://x.com/MEMRIReports/status/1719662664090075199?s=20), he stated that Hamas would continue to rape, kill and maim civilians as what happened on 7th October. Again and again and again and again until Israel is taken and all Jewish people are dead. 

In the meantime, Corbyn has refused to solely condemn Hamas and instantly, but erroneously, attributed the bombing of a hospital to Israel when it was actually a Hamas ally that bombed it. And has not corrected the record since. 

Funny bedfellows, right?",2023-11-03T00:08:47+00:00

> Chanting 'river to the sea' (calling for the destruction of the Israeli state) - a-ok.

Here's a link which will help you understand the breadth of meanings of ""river to the sea"". It doesn't exclusively refer to calling for a one-state solution, there are Palestinians in the West Bank, internationally recognized Israel, and Gaza - these are geographically from the river to the sea.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/21/its-simply-a-call-for-freedom-marchers-defend-contentious-slogan-at-london-palestine-protest

I also don't understand why you and others have suddenly decided that a one-state solution is outside of the overtone window. It is not so in Israel, even though it less popular than two state and indefinite occupation.

Totally agree that intervening against the pride flag is awful. Though as per the article it's not even clear if that happened here.

True. And after winning over the Welsh miners the NUM were instrumental in tilting the labour party towards LGBTQ inclusive legislation and further inclusion.

I agree that Coutts should be able to close Farages account, even if politics was a component, because a business shouldn't be forced to provide services to anyone. They're absolutely stupid for doing so and committed a massive self own by doing it, but they should have the right to do so as a business. They aren't a normal bank, they're a bank which already discriminates based on wealth, and there are already legal provisions to ensure that everyone can get a basic bank account from one of the big 9, of which NatWest is one. In my opinion Farage threw his toys out the pram because he couldn't be part of the exclusive posh boys bank with the fancy cards and name.

The bit that is absolutely insane is the CEO of NatWest briefing journalists on private information about one of their customers, that was then also inaccurate. It boggles the mind why she felt the need to do this.

If they wanted to cancel his account, they should have done so and just shut their mouth.

Yesterday Parliament passed a motion calling for a ceasefire. The Labour motion also called for aid to go into Gaza, for settlements to stop and for a two-state solution. It's pretty solid and comprehensive. 

It's what the SNP wanted. A call for a ceasefire. They're angry because it was written in a way that Labour found more tenable to vote for (essentially removing a bit about collective punishment and adding more onus on Hamas to abide by the ceasefire too) and therefore didn't cause a split in the Labour Party. 

If their goal was legitimately to call for a ceasefire (not get a ceasefire because nothing Parliament says actually matters in this conflict) and not play politics then they would have taken a crossbench approach to the motion to find a way to build a cross-party consensus and increase the change of getting it passed. 

They didn't. They thought that had played Starmer and Labour and wanted a straight vote on their motion to cause a Labour rebellion. They played stupid games and won stupid prizes. Should Hoyle have selected the Labour amendment? Probably not. I am that sympathetic to the SNP given the circumstances of the vote? No. 

But most of all, the ceasefire call passed which no one was expecting because the Government walked out. So for those who legitimately were most concerned about Parliament calling for a ceasefire this is actually a better result than you were expecting yesterday morning.",2024-02-22T11:05:15+00:00

For example they insisted on removing references to 'collective punishment of Palestinians', and gallingly tried to defend this by insisting such statements encouraged violence against people in Britain (an increasingly common tactic of our political class, hiding behind unverified 'threats' in order to avoid scrutiny of their positions).

If you're calling for a '*ceasefire** (\*when a wide range of different conditions have been met)' then you aren't really calling for a ceasefire. And through their actions the Labour leadership have demonstrated they're willing to ride roughshod over a variety of principles which underline British democracy, such as the neutrality of the Speaker, in order to bat for this incredibly far-right Israeli government and their indiscriminate killings in Gaza. 

If Labour's goal was to legitimately call for a ceasefire, they wouldn't have played such silly buggers to ensure their much less meaningful amendment got called for.",2024-02-22T12:47:46+00:00
unitedkingdom,comment,Ceasefire,krprco9,jcelflo,,">They're angry because it was written in a way that Labour found more tenable to vote for

After parsing through all the nonsense what I got was SNP was not really angry about the Labour amendment, but just the procedure nonsense stuff, which is meh.

>They thought that had played Starmer and Labour and wanted a straight vote on their motion to cause a Labour rebellion.

Also, this is a straightforward lie. The SNP agreed to vote for the Labour amendment.

There are two bits to this drama. One is what the substantial difference between the Labour amendment and the SNP motion, the other is parliamentary procedure stuff.

From what I have read, the SNP motion is a simpler and stronger motion that simply calls for a ceasefire, while also mentioning Israeli warcrimes such as collective punishment. The Labour motion is a softer version that conditions the ceasefire on a guarentee that Israel does not have to fear another Oct 7 and also does not mention Israeli warcrimes.

The substantial difference in terms of what is called for is that the SNP motion calls for a change in the conditions immediately, while the Labour motion just catches up to the Israeli position. The condition allows Israel to continue its invasion and occupation without any changes, and the UK position was actually behind the Israeli position. Israel had already agreed in rhetoric to a ceasefire, they claim they cannot practically do it until Hamas is eliminated.

First bit of politicking is here. Labour has whipped against the SNP motion for political gains: they don't tend to cede ground to competing opposition parties. The SNP has agreed to vote for the Labour amendment also to their political advantage. They can claim to be the consistent ones for calling for a ceasefire for months, while Labour had to be forced to do it, and passing a motion they raised is a win for them even with amendments.

Second bit of politicking is the Tories submitted their own amendment, completely taking out the mention of ceasefire at all, making the entire motion pointless. Convention is that parliament only votes for one amendment for opposition day since they have limited time to table motions, and the government amendment is prioritised which somewhat makes sense since they have most MPs. But that essentially removes the Labour option and makes the motion very unlikely to pass (which is partly Labour's fault. The differences between SNP and Labour motions are not that different to warrant such different approachs).

The speaker decides to break convention to allow a vote on both amendments. There are many conspiracies about Labour threatening him etc., but I think ultimate that's a good thing for the outcome. What it did was to bypass the Tory sabotage and for a matter for such importance, its good that a motion calling for ceasefire is ultimately passed. It would have been worse in every way for both the situation and the UK if the Tory sabotage was successful. The world is moving towards gently calling for a ceasefire (granted without using any of the lever available to make material changes). If the UK dithered even on that for political games it would look terrible. But even worse, due to some procedure considerations, the votes were held in order such that the Labour amendment would be voted on first, and if passed, the SNP motion would not be voted on at all.

While the outcome was something the SNP would have been ok with (they were going to vote for the Labour amendment anyway), the way the convention was broken does have serious repercussions to them and other minor parties. It means their motions could be robbed of any chances to ever be voted on. Minor parties already have minimal slots and opportunities to raise motions, and this is one of the few opportunites to hold the major parties accountable by forcing votes on the record. Removing that ability removes significant power from small parties and reinforces the dominance of the 2 major parties. Note that Labour gets 17 opposition days and the SNP only gets 3 per parliamentary session.

Ultimately I think the Tories and SNP got more out of this than Labour, not that your normal person cares about parliamentary procedures that much mind you.

The Tories were the greatest saboteurs in this incident, but they got out of it looking like a neutral sensible party. If the motion didn't pass, that would have been more obvious, and would have looked bad for them. Not too much domestically, but more on the international stage.

The SNP got more than it could've wanted. The motion passed with Labour's amendment, which they already agreed to, and would not have passed if the speaker didn't intervene. Even though the intervention benefitted them in this specific case, they are also right to say it takes power from them. You and I may not have much sympathy for that, but for a separatist party, that is the best thing that could have happened. This is more ""Westminster disfunction"" to prove that Scotland needs to move away from the dominances of the ""English parties"". Even if you take the most charitable stance towards the speaker, which I do, that does mean that Westminster systematically disadvantages smaller parties just to get anything done.

Labour is the only party that came out looking worse (for the relevant constituencies anyway). First, they do not have a consistent stance on Israel/Gaza, unlike the SNP, which, to their credit had called for a ceasefire from the beginning. Labour's slow turn towards ceasefire is unlikely to win them any points in the first place. Second, they don't even have the spine to raise their own motion on the issue, instead had to piggyback on SNP's second ceasefire motion, the first of which they have whipped against. While doing so, they played politics by whipping against the original motion and for their own one with, let's be real, marginal changes. While this kind of politicking is completely standard and expected, when something goes wrong, it still doesn't look good. Thirdly, the way the speaker intervened essentially allowed a vote on their amendment where normally there wouldn't be any, that ignites all sorts of credible conspircies about backdoor dealings between Labour and the speaker.

All in all, despite the ceasefire call having been passed, the UK is left looking like some disfunctional clown politics in the world stage, but it probably would have been even worse if the speaker didn't intervene.",2024-02-23T03:47:48+00:00

Incredibly unbiased source there /s

In September 2014, The Jewish Chronicle published an editorial alleging the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) voted for a ""ban on Jews"" from the International Union of Architects (IUA) and was, as a result, antisemitic.[41] The RIBA motion had actually called for the suspension of the Israeli Association of United Architects over the building of illegal settlements.[42][43] Following a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission, the Chronicle published a letter of response from David Mond, in which he accused the paper of inspiring ""its readers to see antisemitism in every critic"" of Israel.[44]

In August 2016, dozens of prominent Jewish activists including Miriam Margolyes, Ilan Pappe and Michael Rosen signed an open letter criticising the paper for what they viewed as its ""McCarthyite"" ""character assassination"" of Jeremy Corbyn after the paper published ""seven key questions"" for Corbyn, including on his alleged ties to and defence of various Holocaust deniers and on his use of the word ""friends"" for Hamas and Hezbollah.[45]

In December 2019, The Jewish Chronicle published an article by Melanie Phillips which asserted that Islamophobia was a bogus term which provided cover for antisemites. The Board of Deputies of British Jews described its publication as an error, and editor Stephen Pollard acknowledged that ""A number of people within the Jewish community, and friends of the community, have expressed their dismay – and anger – at its content.""[46]

When The Jewish Chronicle faced closure due to financial problems in April 2020, former ANC politician and anti-apartheid activist Andrew Feinstein stated: ""The Jewish Chronicle's equating of antisemitism with criticism of Israel has put back the struggle against real AS & all racism by years."" while the freelance journalist Mira Bar-Hillel considered the paper's potential closure to be ""the best news of the day"" and referred to it as a ""pathetic rag"".[47][undue weight? – discuss]

In July 2021, a letter was sent to the British press regulatory body IPSO requesting a standards investigation into The Jewish Chronicle due to what the signatories believed to be ""systemic"" failings. The nine signatories were mostly linked to the Labour party and had either been libelled by The Jewish Chronicle or had complaints about factually inaccurate reporting upheld by the regulator between 2018 and 2021. The complainants alleged that the paper's editorial standards were ""shockingly low"" and stated that ""unless standards there improve there will be more victims, while readers will continue to be misled.""[48][49]

Writing in the Byline Times, Brian Cathcart, Professor of Journalism at Kingston University, argued that IPSO had failed to act on ""the collapse of journalism standards at The Jewish Chronicle"", which he stated had ""been found by the IPSO itself to have breached its code of practice 28 times."" He suggested IPSO's failure to act was in part due to the regulator's unwillingness to attract accusations of attempting to silence the paper from the Conservative Party, who benefitted politically from the debate around antisemitism in the Labour Party in which the paper was a prominent player. He also identified The Jewish Chronicle's owner Robbie Gibb as an obstacle to an IPSO investigation into standards at the paper.[50]

Closer to home, if ""terrorism"" can be redefined to mean ""action against the UK's national interests"" (which is in turn shorthand for the governing party's interests, because they sure as hell don't give a flying one about the people) then there are a lot of juicy laws on the books that enable all that old-fashioned due process to be bypassed, People can be held and their property taken without any need for a charge if you invoke the ""T""-word, and the more liberally it can be invoked, the easier it will be next time and the time after.",2013-08-19T14:57:30+00:00

I know from direct experience that the police have set up groups that feedback into the police and have managed to improve policy and oversight within the police force, and the massive issue they're facing (or at least, for the one I'm aware of) is a lack of BAME people joining to get their voices heard, which is critical because without those voices and experiences, things will simply not improve at the pace they need it to.",2020-06-28T23:54:55+00:00

unitedkingdom,post,Israel-Palestine War/War,f7qw1,ciaran036,"Mavi Marmara survivors speak out against Israeli ""whitewash""","From George Galloway's mailing list:
""Today, Israel has released a report into its actions on the Mavi Marmara last year, when the ship - carrying aid as part of a flotilla to Gaza - was attacked by Israel, leading to the deaths of 9 Turks and the injuring of dozens more.
Viva Palestina's Kevin Ovenden, who was on board the Mavi Marmara when it was attacked by Israeli forces in May last year, said, ""The claim by Israel's Turkel Commission that Israeli forces acted legally when they killed nine people aboard the Mavi Marmara, and left another brain dead, will be laughed out of court by all but the Israeli government and its most fanatical supporters.
""This whitewash commission was set up by the Netanyahu government, the same people who commissioned the assault on the aid ship. It is simply unfeasible to claim that, for example, the two men shot immediately to the left and right of me, were gunned down in some act of self-defence. They were shot from above. No Israeli commando was in sight of us when the bullets rang out.
""Israel has refused an independent international inquiry and instead was brazen enough to establish this farce. No Turkish official, lawyer or representative was allowed to take part. One of the only two international observers who was a fig-leaf for the commission's ""impartiality"" was Lord (David) Trimble. He was invited on to it a few months after founding a friends of Israel initiative. And as a leading establishment figure in the north of Ireland he refused for decades an independent inquiry into the killing of 14 unarmed civilians on the streets of Derry in 1972, the truth about the massacre only being officially acknowledged 38 years later with the report of the Saville inquiry.
""The United Nations Human Rights Council already found last year prima facie evidence of grave human rights abuses and war crimes aboard the Mavi Marmara.
""Rather than entertaining this charade from Tel Aviv, the British government should demand that Israel and those responsible for the atrocity of Bloody Monday on the Mediterranean on 31 May last year are held to account and to the same universal standards of justice that are required of other states.
""Whatever risible PR Israel and its supporters attempt to spin, that is going to happen. And on the one year anniversary of the attack on the Mavi Marmara a second, bigger international aid effort will set sail for the point at where it was so brutally attacked and will ask, civil society organisations, religious groups, politicians, governments, and people of conscience around the world to demand that all relevant governments and international bodies all it safe passage to Gaza.
""Wikileaks has confirmed what independent Israeli researchers told us last year. The siege on Gaza is carefully calibrated by the Israeli government to keep the Palestinian people in a state of dependency, with their economy society hovering just above complete collapse.
""The French foreign minister Michele Alliot-Marie is the latest high profile visitor to Gaza and Palestine to call for an end to the blockade.
""The pressure to end this barbarous policy is increasing. I think I can speak for all those who were aboard the Mavi Marmara in saying that we are redoubling our efforts in 2011 to bring it to an end this year. We will be part of the next aid missions, by land, by sea and by air.
""This sick joke from an Israeli government that has already lost all international credibility will serve only to increase our determination to bring justice to the Palestinian people.""
Sarah Colbourne, Director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and who was also onboard the Marvi Marmara when the Israeli Defence Force attacked the boat said:
“However hard the Israeli Government attempts to rewrite history, they can’t rewrite the truth. The facts are simple, the Marvi Marmara was carrying essential humanitarian aid like baby milk to the besieged people of Gaza. There were no guns or weapons on board the boat, we were in international waters, when over 300 bullets – or one for every two people on board - rained down on us, killing 9 people and injuring over 50.
The actions of the Israeli Defence Force and the Israeli Government where by all international standards of law illegal as is their continued occupation of Gaza and the oppression of the Palestinian people.”",2011-01-24T00:00:20+00:00

-

>The bodies of a British mum and her two teenage daughters were found ""cuddled together"" after they were all killed by Hamas militants on October 7.

>Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters Noiya, 16, and Yahel, 13, were killed when militants stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel. In a chilling last text, the Bristol-born mum-of-two told worried family members: ""I can hear them. They are here at our house. They are shooting and shouting 'Die Israel'. Please call for help.""

>The woman's parents, Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a ""devoted mother"" who ""tried to protect her daughters to the end"". They added: ""Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms."" Mrs Brisley said knowing that the three women died holding each other was ""a small comfort"", adding she hopes they did not suffer and it was ""a quick death"".

>The heartbroken parents, who live in Bridgend, Wales, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren, with Mrs Brisley saying: ""Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us."" She added Lianne was a ""wonderful"" person and said that Israel was a ""very friendly"" and ""a lovely place to bring up a family"".

>They said they became worried when they first saw the news of the October 7 attack on TV. Mr Brisley explained: ""I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response. I think by then she had already gone. Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in. Everybody on the street was killed or badly injured.""

>Lianne met her husband Eli in Israel after she first went to stay on a kibbutz aged just 19. The pair were married in Britain, going on to have daughters Yehal and Noiya together who were British citizens. They lived in the Kibbutz Be’eri, near the border with Gaza in the south of Israel and were used to rocket attacks. However, their shocked family said nothing could have prepared them for the attack on October 7 which unfolded via a flurry of chilling texts and phone calls.

>Relative Raz Matalon said: ""Early on Saturday morning when Hamas fired all the missiles at Israel we called Eli and Lianne and other members of the family, like we always do. Lianne told us this was not like a usual missile attack. It was different. She said she had heard shooting and hand grenades exploding and that the noise of gunfire was getting closer. Then she said: 'We have to be quiet because they are near.’""

>At least 1,400 Israelis were killed in the Hamas attack when gunmen infiltrated communities near the Gaza Strip. The latest official figures from Palestine show that 8,306 people have been killed and 21,048 have been wounded in Gaza since October 7.

unitedkingdom,comment,Israel-Palestine Conflict/Conflict,k6e3rwf,tylersburden,,"In 2014, Hamas brutally killed 23 pro peace Palestinians. 

>Many of these unlawful killings were publicly billed as attacks against people assisting Israel during the July and August 2014 conflict as part of an operation, codenamed “Strangling Necks”, to target “collaborators”. However, in reality, at least 16 of those executed had been in Hamas custody since before the conflict broke out. Many had been awaiting the outcome of their trials when they were taken away from prison and summarily executed.

>Hamas forces also abducted, tortured or attacked members and supporters of Fatah, their main rival political organization within Gaza, including former members of the Palestinian Authority security forces. Not a single person has been held accountable for the crimes committed by Hamas forces against Palestinians during the 2014 conflict, indicating that these crimes were either ordered or condoned by the authorities.

>“Instead of upholding justice, the Hamas authorities and leadership have continuously encouraged and facilitated these appalling crimes against powerless individuals. Their failure to even condemn the unlawful killings, abduction and torture of perceived suspects leaves them effectively with blood on their hands,” said Philip Luther. 

>Atta Najjar, a former police officer under the Palestinian Authority who has a mental disability, was serving a 15-year prison term imposed by a military court after he was arrested in 2009 and subsequently convicted of “collaborating” with Israel. On 22 August 2014, he was taken out from the prison and executed. 

>“There were marks of torture and bullet shots on his body. His arms and legs were broken… his body was as if you’d put it in a bag and smashed it… His body was riddled with about 30 bullets. He had slaughter marks around his neck, marks of knives… And from behind the head – there was no brain. Empty… It was difficult for us to carry him… He was heavy, like when you put meat in a bag; no bones. His bones were smashed. They broke him in the prison,” said his brother, who retrieved the body from al-Shifa hospital morgue on 22 August 2014. 

>As well as carrying out unlawful killings, others abducted by Hamas were subjected to torture, including severe beatings with truncheons, gun butts, hoses and wire or held in stress positions. Some were interrogated and tortured or otherwise ill-treated in a disused outpatient’s clinic within the grounds of Gaza City’s main al-Shifa hospital. At least three people arrested during the conflict accused of “collaboration” died in custody.

>“Hamas forces have displayed a disregard for the most fundamental rules of international humanitarian law. Torture and cruel treatment of detainees in an armed conflict is a war crime. Extrajudicial executions are also war crimes. The de facto administration in Gaza must send a message to all law enforcement forces to treat prisoners humanely at all times. All allegations of extrajudicial execution and torture must be impartially and independently investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice in fair trials,” said Philip Luther.

-

>The Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem has warned the ‘UK has a big problem on its hands’ as she said anti-Semitism is on the rise globally after an ‘anti-Israeli mob’ stormed Dagestan airport on the weekend. 

>A plane from Tel Aviv to the Russian Republic of Dagestan was forced to land at an alternate airport on Sunday after a ‘mob hunting for Jews’ stormed it.

>The mobs later targeted Makhachkala airport, where the plane was diverted to, after it was reported that was where it would land.

>After footage shared online showed swathes of men running into Makhachkala airport, with some heard shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’, Jerusalem’s deputy mayor has warned ""Europe is the next stop"" for anti-Semitism.

>Fleur Hassan-Nahoum, the Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem, told LBC's Nick Ferrari at Breakfast: ""I don't think we'd ever imagine that in 2023 we would see a modern day pogrom happening in Russia with the Muslim community of Dagestan.”

>She continued: “Unfortunately we’re seeing this now develop in all the major capital cities and what you have to ask yourself is: who are the police protecting?”

>“We’re the first stop on the tour of global Jihad.

>""Europe is the next stop and I think the UK has a big problem on its hands”.

>Videos shared online showed crowds breaking through doors at the airport terminal while swathes of others stormed the runway of the airport.

>Passengers on board the plane from Tel Aviv were instructed to remain inside after landing, as police moved in to protect them.

>Police arrested 60 people following the outbreak, while 20 people were injured, and two have been left in critical condition.

>Ms Hassan-Nahoum added: ""It's just very sad because it's not just in Chechnya, in Dagestan, but we've seen it in the streets of London unfortunately as well.

>""100,000 people shouting 'from the river to the sea' which means the annihilation of the State of Israel - many people shouting 'death to the Jews'.

>""So I don't think this problem of the rising anti-Semitism is solely in Russia, it really is in every capital in the world right now.""

>It comes after thousands of pro-Palestine protesters gathered in the streets of London on Saturday for the second weekend in a row.

>Shouts of “stop arming Israel. Stop bombing Gaza” were heard. While some were also heard chanting “from the river to the sea” - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean.

>More than 1,000 Metropolitan Police were deployed across London amid the protests.

>Nine arrests were made, including some which are being treated as suspected hate crimes.

>The Met police faced backlash from the government following the first weekend of protests after officers concluded a chant of ‘Jihad’ was lawful.

>Reacting to online footage of the events in Makhachkala, X users expressed their concern, as one wrote: “I pray for you and the safety of your people.”

>“I can't believe this stuff is happening and I am so sorry you personally have to deal with all this grief. Unreal. Stay strong, this is just horrendous,” another added.

>Russian state-owned RIA Novosti outlet reported that the airport was forced to close due to riots taking place.

>""Israel expects the Russian authorities to protect all Israeli citizens and all Jews, and to act decisively against the rioters and against incitement to violence against Jews and Israelis,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said after the incident.

>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has issued a statement as he said the mob's actions are ""not an isolated incident...but part of Russia's widespread culture of hatred towards other nations"".

>""Appalling videos from Makhachkala, Russia, where an angry mob broke into the airport searching for Israeli citizens on the flight from Tel-Aviv,"" he said.

>""This is not an isolated incident in Makhachkala, but rather part of Russia’s widespread culture of hatred toward other nations, which is propagated by state television, pundits, and authorities.

>""The Russian foreign minister has made a series of antisemitic remarks in the last year. The Russian President also used antisemitic slurs. For Russian propaganda talking heads on official television, hate rhetoric is routine.

>""Even the most recent Middle East escalation prompted antisemitic statements from Russian ideologists. Russian antisemitism and hatred toward other nations are systemic and deeply rooted.

> When Musheir El-Farra climbs into bed in Gaza each night, he cannot get the sounds of people screaming out of his head.

> Since last week, the British civil engineer has been plagued by memories of an Israeli bomb attack on a residential block in Khan Younis in which, he said, 16 of his relatives were killed.

> “Every time I go to bed I can see them, and I’m saying to myself: ‘Is there going to be more?’ Every night. Every night I can hear those screams, those wails,” he said.

> El-Farra said the “massacre” was 10 metres from the house he was sheltering in, and that he now knows more than 100 people who have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its aerial bombardment and ground operation.

> Describing the aftermath of the attack in the early hours of the morning last Tuesday, he said: “I saw the body of my beloved cousin, a boy I’ve loved since he was a kid, called Hatim, in front of me, on his back, with his backside exposed and we put a blanket on him.

> “I saw the body of his son who was thrown from the third floor into the back yard in front of our house. I saw the body of two of the babies who were killed in that massacre.

> “I saw an old woman who was severely injured being carried by our relatives. I saw them all being taken to ambulances and I saw mutilated bodies. I saw all this at a metre’s distance.

> “To be honest I’m really worried about PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] when I go back to Britain – if I go back to Britain.”

> El-Farra, 62, who grew up in Gaza and now lives in Sheffield, is among the 200 British or dual nationals in the Palestinian territory. More than 8,000 people in the strip have been killed, according to the Gaza health ministry, since Hamas’s brutal attacks in Israel on 7 October. Hamas militants rampaged through southern Israel, killing 1,400 people and taking 230 hostages.

> On Sunday, El-Farra and his nephew Mohammed Ghalayini, a civil servant from Manchester who is also trapped in Khan Younis, were able to reassure their loved ones of their safety after the lifting of a 36-hour near-total communications blackout imposed by Israel.

> “It was very scary to be cut off like that, to feel like you really, truly have no voice while you’re undergoing this onslaught from the Israeli army,” said Ghalayini, 44.

> But the bombardment has not eased. “A couple of minutes before you called the house really shook like an earthquake, like it swayed from side to side for a second,” he said on Sunday evening.

> “It’s all around you. You can’t walk anywhere without seeing some signs of bombing, whether it’s buildings or debris or cars that have windows shattered or massive dents or people, the walking wounded, walking around with bandages on their heads or with broken limbs and it’s like, wow, these are people that have just escaped from bombing.”

> Ghalayini and El-Farra, who is chair of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign in Sheffield, said they had no power and struggled to charge their phones, and that water and food was scarce, with 12-hour queues to buy bread.

> El-Farra, who is sheltering in a three-storey block with his UK-born son Qasem, 21, and four other families, added that it was shocking to see evacuees from northern Gaza sleeping on cardboard boxes on pavements in the centre of Khan Younis.

> He has been documenting on social media the horrors of Israel’s bombardment, which he described as “collective punishment on a massive, massive scale [and] a war crime under international law”.

> But he was keen to stress that there had been some glimpses of hope amid the brutality. “It’s unbelievable; we get bombed one night and the following day the market and the high street and people are trying to get back to life,” he said.

> “I have seen people going into bird supplies shops and buying food for their birds. I took a video and I was crying because this is a great sign, like how on earth in an area which has been bombed people think of their birds and shops open for the people.”

> He added that this was also evidence that Palestinians had become somewhat immune to such suffering. “I am sad for how they’re not feeling the pain as much as they do because they are used to it, although this is the most vicious attack according to everybody,” El-Farra said.

> “But I’m proud as well because this is a sign of strength – although it shouldn’t be, human beings should be scared and people are scared, terrified – but there’s a sense of togetherness and strength and that’s fantastic.”

> Despite their fears for their safety, Ghalayini and El-Farra said they had considered staying in Gaza to help with the relief effort.

> Ghalayini, who was born in Saudi Arabia but moved to the UK when he was a one-year-old, said: “I’m a skilled individual, I’m organised, I’m fluent in English and articulate. I can be a voice, I can be a witness, I can help people get through this. Civilians in war are seen as victims, but I’m not a victim. I am someone who wants to support the community through this.”

> El-Farra added: “I’m among my people, and what affects them, affects me and I feel that, even if I leave, my heart will be bleeding for the people left behind.”

unitedkingdom,comment,Israel-Palestine Conflict/Conflict,k7l0e7k,tylersburden,,"So this is darkly fascinating. In 2015, Jeremy Corbyn was trying to become Labour leader. Plenty of people criticised him. A few praised him. 

One of the people that did praise him was the then deputy foreign minister in the Hamas terrorist group, Ghazi Hamad. He said that [""I find that he has very good sympathy and support for the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian struggle and he is frankly against the occupation, against the racist policy of Israel, against settlements"".](https://archive.ph/N619d#selection-2045.0-2045.206) 

Quite the praise. 

Since then, Ghazi Hamad has become the official spokesman of the Hamas Terrorist Group that form the Palestine government. [In a video on social media released yesterday](https://x.com/MEMRIReports/status/1719662664090075199?s=20), he stated that Hamas would continue to rape, kill and maim civilians as what happened on 7th October. Again and again and again and again until Israel is taken and all Jewish people are dead. 

In the meantime, Corbyn has refused to solely condemn Hamas and instantly, but erroneously, attributed the bombing of a hospital to Israel when it was actually a Hamas ally that bombed it. And has not corrected the record since.

unitedkingdom,comment,Gaza Genocide/Genocide,kjscflo,Grey_Belkin,,"The [statement of commitment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_Memorial_Day_(UK)) for HMD in the UK was created after the Stockholm Declaration was agreed. It is a simplified version of the Stockholm Declaration, and includes a commitment to remember all victims of Nazi Persecution, **and victims of all genocides**:

- We recognise that the Holocaust shook the foundations of modern civilisation. Its unprecedented character and horror will always hold universal meaning.


- We believe the Holocaust must have a permanent place in our nation's collective memory. We honour the survivors still with us, and reaffirm our shared goals of mutual understanding and justice.


- We must make sure that future generations understand the causes of the Holocaust and reflect upon its consequences. We vow to remember the victims of Nazi persecution and of all genocide.


- We value the sacrifices of those who have risked their lives to protect or rescue victims, as a touchstone of the human capacity for good in the face of evil.


**- We recognise that humanity is still scarred by the belief that race, religion, disability or sexuality make some people's lives worth less than others'. Genocide, antisemitism, racism, xenophobia and discrimination still continue. We have a shared responsibility to fight these evils.**


**- We pledge to strengthen our efforts to promote education and research about the Holocaust and other genocide. We will do our utmost to make sure that the lessons of such events are fully learnt.**


- We will continue to encourage Holocaust remembrance by holding an annual Holocaust Memorial Day. **We condemn the evils of prejudice, discrimination and racism. We value a free, tolerant, and democratic society.**


What she has said is not incompatible at all with the commitment and intent of Holocaust Memorial Day.

unitedkingdom,comment,Gaza Genocide/Genocide,kjsbs8y,Blue_winged_yoshi,,"This is why Holocaust Memorial Day is important cos fuckwits like this have no idea. The Holocaust wasn’t “just” the industrialised murder of 6 million Jews along side queer people, Roma, the disabled and other groups deemed undesirable, it was a succession of individual crimes of stomach turning horror. 

One such incident took place at Babi Yar in Ukraine outside Kyiv. Jewish inhabitants were ordered to assemble at 8pm on a given day otherwise they would be shot. They believed they were being resettled. Their possessions were taken, they were stripped naked and murdered in a ravine. 

The following is a truck drivers description of the scene. This event systemically stripped 33,000 victims of their possessions, dignity and life. It covers 0.55% of the holocaust’s victims. 

*Once undressed, they were led into the ravine which was about 150 metres long and 30 metres wide and a good 15 metres deep ... When they reached the bottom of the ravine they were seized by members of the Schutzpolizei and made to lie down on top of Jews who had already been shot ... The corpses were literally in layers. A police marksman came along and shot each Jew in the neck with a submachine gun ... I saw these marksmen stand on layers of corpses and shoot one after the other ... The marksman would walk across the bodies of the executed Jews to the next Jew, who had meanwhile lain down, and shoot him.*

What's happening in Gaza is horrible, But, as far as I'm aware Israel has no system of trains shipping as many Palestinian men women & children as possible to extermination camps where they are put into gas chambers - where upto 15,000 Jewish people were ""exterminated"" per day & cremated by this system during the Holocaust.

Article by Charles Hymas of the Telegraph

> The refugee who wore a paraglider image at a pro-Palestine protest is to have her immigration status reviewed, The Telegraph understands.
>
>Heba Alhayek, 29, was one of three women convicted this week under the Terrorism Act after they displayed the images following the October 7 terror attack on Israel which killed 1,200 people and saw Hamas fighters cross the border using paragliders.
>
>The three, including Noimutu Olayinka Taiwo and Pauline Ankunda, were handed conditional discharges for “carrying or displaying an article to arouse reasonable suspicion” that they were supporters of Hamas.
>
>Alhayek was granted refugee status in the UK after claiming that her life would be in danger if she returned to Gaza because of her family’s criticism of Hamas, her lawyer told the court.
>
>It is understood the Home Office is now looking into the issues arising from her conviction with a spokesman saying supporting a terrorist group would not be tolerated.
>
>“The Government will always prioritise the safety and security of the UK, the offences associated with proscription make it clear that supporting banned terrorist groups will not be tolerated,” said the Home Office spokesman.
>
>It follows a crackdown on foreign nationals for alleged anti-Semitic behaviour that saw an exiled Egyptian television presenter have his visa revoked for allegedly publicly backing Hamas. Moataz Matar was also placed on a watchlist, barring him from returning to Britain, after taking part in pro-Palestinian protests in London.
>
>The disclosure came amid growing criticism of the judge in the case - Tan Ikram - after it emerged that he liked a social media post branding Israel a terrorist.
>
>Judge Ikram told the court he had decided “not to punish” the three women because, although they had “crossed the line” by displaying the images, he accepted they were not “seeking to show any support for Hamas”. The maximum sentence for the offence is six months in jail, but Judge Ikram limited it to discharges.
>It emerged on Wednesday that three weeks ago, the deputy senior district judge liked a LinkedIn post by a barrister who had previously promoted conspiracy theories claiming that Israel allowed the October 7 attack.
>
>The post, by barrister Sham Uddin, stated: “Free Palestine. To the Israeli terrorist both in the United Kingdom, the United States, and of course Israel you can run, you can bomb but you cannot hide - justice will be coming for you.”
>
>Judge Ikram may now face disciplinary action after judicial guidance issued last year stated that judges known to have strong views should consider whether to hear a case. According to social media guidance for judges, they should “be aware that you can convey information about yourself and your views by … liking posts”.
>
>The Government is, however, powerless to take action to increase the sentences. Because the charges against the three women were “summary” offences only triable in the magistrates court, they are not covered by the scheme that allows the Attorney General to seek to reverse “unduly lenient” sentences.
>
>The scheme enables Victoria Prentis, the Attorney General, to refer a case to the Appeal Court to reconsider a sentence if there is a complaint that it is “unduly lenient”.
>Downing Street described the sentencing decision as “deeply troubling”. A source said: “Serious questions are being raised in government on how a judge posting this online was able to preside over this landmark case and what this means for the sentencing decision.”
>
>Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, tweeted: “Utterly shocking that a member of the judiciary may have behaved in this way. With anti-Semitism at an all-time high, judges must be impartial and beyond reproach. Justice must be done and it must also be seen to be done. The sentence must be reviewed.”
>
>After the sentence, the Jewish Leadership Council said that the women had got off “scot-free”.
>
>Lord Wolfson KC, a former justice minister, said: “Of course judges, like the rest of us, have political opinions. But the longstanding practice of the judiciary was to keep those opinions private, at least for so long as the judge continued to sit.
>

You are guilty of a crime for doing something that makes people *suspect you have done something illegal* even if you haven't actually done that illegal thing?

To then use a conviction as evidence that you actually have done the illegal thing in order to deport you just seems extremely dangerous.

Don't get me wrong, if they were proved to have actually supported a terrorist organisation in any material way then they it might well be the case that they should be jailed and even deported.

unitedkingdom,post,PLO,972no4,KeyForm6,Questions about the recent Corbyn allegations,"Please don't nuke this post with downvotes. I'm not taking a side here, just asking questions and trying to get at the truth. Here are some pretty elementary questions which have occurred to me in reading about the latest attacks on Corbyn.

First, where is the proof that Atef Bseiso (the person whose grave Corbyn supposedly laid the wreath on) was a terrorist? None presented. Just Mossad's word. The French were outraged that he was assassinated on their soil. The fact that they had to go behind France's back implies that Israel wouldn't have met the standards of proof that was required by the UK's close ally, France. The implicit assumption that we should trust Israel over France seems frankly bizarre.

Second, is there any proof that Corbyn did actually lay the wreath at the grave of Bseiso? None has been presented. We do have evidence that he laid or held *a* wreath.

Third, why is the PLO being called a terrorist organization? It isn't formally regarded as one by the UK.

Fourth, why is it assumed that Corbyn had expressly done this event to honour Bseiso, as opposed to Corbyn incidentally paying his respects while he was there because other people in the group were doing it? And even if it were a genuine terrorist (and again, there's no proof, only Mossad's word) why would an obscure MP, who obviously isn't going to be seen by the victims' families and therefore hurt them, be hesitant to pay respects to any dead person, even Osama Bin Laden, in the name of some shared human bond, the fact that even terrorists are human beings, and a desire to show empathy toward alienated communities, much in the same way as he did with the IRA and the Labour Party did generally as prefatory to the Good Friday Agreement?",2018-08-13T22:04:14+00:00

He also asked for evidence of that.

A picture of a grave of accused members doesn't actually prove Corbyn was honouring Black September. Is it not the case that these people are considered martyrs because the PLO official line is that they were NOT Black September members?

Pending the results of the investigation, this is a very big lie. The Lobby hasn't proven any of it. All they have been doing is using their shills to propagate this propaganda.

The PLO/PA doesn't pay Hamas members any salaries whatsoever. In fact, part of the failure of reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah in 2016 has been [the refusal](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/en/originals/2016/03/palestinian-hamas-fatah-reconciliation-doha.html) of the PA to pay salaries to employees (non-prisoners) appointed by Hamas government in the Gaza Strip since it took it over in June 2007. 

Hopefully the investigation will show that the PA/PLO payments to the prisoners are in no means in the form of rewards. I'm yet to see any proof of PA/PLO announcements in the form of ""kill x Israelis and get payed a y amount"". 

What the PA/PLO pay to the prisoners are two kinds: 

1) Salaries of its employees who had been already on its payroll before they were detained by Israel. These do not include a single Hamas or Islamic Jihad. Again I challenge the Lobby and its shills to show a single penny was paid in the form of a monthly salary to a Hamas or PIJ member. 

2) A monthly stipend known as the [""canteen money""](http://samidoun.net/2013/04/israeli-corporation-profits-from-high-price-of-prisoners-food/) which is paid straight to the suppliers of the Israeli prison canteens (which have been privatized recently and outsourced to Israeli companies). This may have gone to cover the stipends of prisoners of non-Fatah prisoners. But it is difficult to tell how these ""unsavoury"" prisoners will eat and survive in a private prison when they get no money from any side (the Israeli or the Palestinian).

It is also unfortunate that Whitehall insists on listening to Lobby organizations who have little clue about Palestinian politics. One would think the Northern Ireland situation would have improved their knowledge of what a population under a military occupation would act. But Whitehall is just being Whitehall.

unitedkingdom,post,PLO,ld67kx,OrganicEstate22,Tragedy of vulnerable autistic young girl,"On the 23rd November 2020, my daughter took her life after a buildup of critical events, abuse and multiple failures by the local authority to act. My daughter was a young vulnerable adult with learning difficulties and mental health problems.

On the 29th November 2020, I received a call from a manager of Children’s services, Mrs W. In this call I asked if they would be opening a serious case review, to which she avoided the subject and could only reply it’s no one's fault.

I have since become aware that under the Care Act 2014 section 44, a Safeguarding Adult Review should have taken place as a mandatory requirement as my daughter was an adult with additional care and support needs who died as a result of not having her care needs met and being I suspect mentally abused by her then boyfriend and his family. Her boyfriend was was my daughters registered carer and received payment for this.

I have made enquiries and this investigation which is covered by law has not commenced.

The Local Authority Children’s Services were aware of my concerns regarding boyfriend and his family. I sent several emails and made calls to the service, outlining my concerns of abuse towards my daughter which seemed to fall on deaf ears as my concerns to this date have not been addressed.

Concerns were made known to Children’s services by the Specialist Mother and Baby Team (SMABS) about the possible controlling nature of my daughters boyfriend in the relationship.

Although my daughter at the time of her death would not have been under Children’s Services care, where concerns of abuse of a vulnerable adult are reported they have a duty to pass this information on to the relevant agencies. Something which did not happen.

When Children’s services were first contacted after the birth of child A, my daughters child, she was 17 and still fell under Children’s services.

Service failures occurred as referrals were made on the following dates and no contact was made by Children’s services to my daughter. My daughters case had previously been stepped down to Early Help following a pre-birth assessment. Early Help had all but disappeared following my daughters move from the boyfriends family home and made no contact following the birth.

16th March 2020 - The First Response team contacted. My daughter was 4 weeks postnatal and her GP had diagnosed her as suffering from postnatal depression.

20th March 2020 – Health Visitor completed a MARF referral form.

9TH April 2020- Specialist Mother and Baby Mental Health team (SMABS). Case reviewed in safeguarding supervision and it was agreed for a referral to be made to Children’s Social Care . Referral made by Mrs J on the 15th April 2020.

Multiple failures by Children’s and Adult services have occurred.

My daughter had an ongoing formal complaint asking for her needs to be assessed by the Local Authorities. Given my daughters extensive involvement with Children’s services, her learning difficulties and declining mental health. Services had an opportunity to anticipate disaster.

My daughter was a young autistic lady who was severely depressed and incontinent and had no meaningful support network around her. Socially isolated,controlled and manipulated by her boyfriend and largely unsupported by the local authority. Concerns were not passed on and investigated. I find it completely unacceptable that Children’s services allowed my daughter to live with a random unknown family, engaged to a stranger from the internet, when at that time she was pregnant,had suspected autism and had just failed a mental capacity test and no support network around her. Children’s services did not contact us as a family. Weeks before my daughters autism assessment took place Children’s Services closed and stepped down to Early Help who did not monitor the situation effectively and disappeared from my daughters life. Even after a diagnosis of autism and suspected borderline personality disorder no support package was put in place.

A week before my daughter's death I spoke to a social worker Mrs H on the phone.

I told her my concerns of my daughters declining mental health and the risk of suicide and also again stated my concerns of abuse by both the boyfriend and his family.

My daughter was allowed to slip through MULTIPLE safety nets.

Had services supported and investigated concerns my daughter could very well be alive today. It is abhorrent that no investigation has yet started.

I have informed the coroner of all my concerns who will review these in a forthcoming inquest where the media will likely pick up. I want my daughter's case to be looked at and properly investigated.

Some key points are as follows:

* My daughter was identified by her home town children's services and the Local Police Force as at risk of sexual exploitation.
* My daughter moved into the boyfriends parental home at 17, she had met him online at around 14/15 years old. He was 18 at that time and arranged to meet my daughter in her home town at a hotel. I stopped this and informed his mother at that time.
* My daughter later confirmed that he had sent sexually explicit photos.
* At 16 shortly before her 17th birthday, a Mental Capacity test took place before my daughters move away from her home town . The outcome was that at that time my daughter did not have the capacity to make safe, informed decisions.
* My daughter was classed as a child in need.
* Had an Education, Health and Care plan in place in her home town, was not picked up by the current Children’s Services.
* My daughter had wanted to continue college but was not supported in any meaningful way by services to do this. My daughter struggled intellectually and would not be able to fight her case in order to gain a place and describe her circumstances. My daughter had tried to apply for college in the area but was told she could not because she was pregnant. My daughter felt at that time that she was being discriminated against because of her disabilities.
* My daughter was struggling with postnatal depression.
* My daughter was autistic and mentally behind her peers by 4 years. She struggled to understand much of the world, it’s people and their motives.
* My daughter had a low average IQ and suspected dyslexia.
* She had recently received a psychiatric report stating she had borderline personality disorder.
* My daughter had very recently had to endure a late term surgical abortion after being told by Children’s Services that the baby would be taken at birth. It was late as she also had symptoms of covid-19 (could not be confirmed as kits were not available at the time in the area) and had to wait until well enough.
* My daughter suffered from incontinence following the birth of child A. Affecting her ability to go out frequently.
* My daughter had an ongoing formal complaint asking for her needs to be assessed by the Local Authorities.
* My daughter was turned down by the Local Adult services. My daughter was not given a reason for refusal and told to contact the autism college as an alternative. My daughter did not meet their criteria, although did receive counselling from them.
* My daughter had a mental breakdown on the 14th May 2020 which resulted in her allegedly slapping child A on the face. Myself and daughters father were both on the phone to her at the time of the incident. Police did not take statements from ourselves. After many calls to Children’s services approximately 1 month later, they took my statement. This statement differs from the boyfriends version of events.
* My daughter admitted herself to a General Hospital on the night of the incident. She was discharged by the hospital hours later but did not get to speak to a psychiatrist. She told a nurse she could not recall what happened. That same night she called myself and said the same. After speaking with the boyfriend once home, my daughter accepted his version of events.
* Two social workers asked my daughter in the presence of the boyfriend if she was being controlled and coerced.
* I shared with Children’s services my concerns with the controlling and coercive behaviour I was seeing from the boyfriend and asked that they speak to my daughter privately multiple times. It took approximately five months for this to happen.
* A recording of a PLO meeting was made for my daughter in order to listen back later and understand what was happening as her learning difficulties sometimes affected her understanding of things. When my daughter is asked a question, the boyfriends mother can be clearly heard taking control of the answer my daughter gave.
* Instances of the boyfriend restraining my daughter, leaving bruising. The boyfriend was told by SMABS he should not be doing this.
* My daughter kept in regular contact with family and friends through facebook and calls, these were all monitored by the boyfriend. Even when asking for privacy he would be present and would often speak over and for my daughter and then pass on these private conversions to his mother.
* It has recently been discovered that the boyfriend had embarked on a relationship with my daughters only friend in the area days after my daughters death. Her husband has suggested that this has been going on for much longer. I feel that my daughters private thoughts were being passed on to the boyfriend via this “friend”.
* At various critical points, such as when my daughter wanted to breastfeed child A, the boyfriend was not supportive of her choices and attempted to sabotage the midwife's training.
* Instances of the boyfriends father, appearing to tip alcohol into child A's mouth as a “joke” on a visitation. He was very aware of how upset my daughter would become as this had caused previous upset to my daughter when it was suggested whilst pregnant.
* Instances of threats of taking child A away from my daughter in phone calls, facebook messages and an aggressive and threatening visit to her home from the boyfriends older 29 year old brother.
* Despite my daughters many difficulties, she received no advocate until quite late into the proceedings of her ongoing battle to get her daughter back into her care.
* Several weeks before my daughters death, Mrs A from a autism college contacted me to share concerns for my daughters welfare. She was concerned that she might harm herself as the boyfriend was considering going back to work. She asked if I could travel to stay with her. She spoke to the boyfriend about this. The boyfriend made it clear that I was not welcome in the house.
* A visit to my daughters home was made by Mrs H to speak to my daughter privately after an aggressive confrontation as the parenting assessments took place by the boyfriend who stated that himself and my daughter would not be partaking. I was on the phone to my daughter when he arrived back home shouting about how he had “lost it”. Mrs H asked my daughter directly if she still wanted to do the assessments, which she did.

I urge that you take my concerns and grievances very seriously.

I will not allow this matter to be dropped and brushed under the carpet. The fact that a review hasn’t yet taken place, plays on my fears that the grieving process I am in, is being taken advantage of and the case will be lost in the system.

I have asked Mrs W for clarification on what investigations took place into the abuse claims and she has not been forthcoming. It was also suggested that contact arrangements to see my granddaughter could be affected if I pursue the matter.

Furthermore I have attempted to gain access to my daughters care records, I gave all the correct documentation to the council. The council has since contacted me telling me I now need a probate or letter of administration, a power of attorney or a will. I feel processes are being made as difficult as possible in order to dissuade me in seeking answers.

I will keep escalating this as far as I can.

I will be separately sending this email to the local MP.

I felt it urgent to pass on the above information to everyone copied into this email in the first instance. Following this, I will be compiling a timeline of events together with corroborating evidence, and can make this available if needed.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I look forward to hearing from you if you need anymore information

History did not begin in 1948 in Israel.  
Maybe it started for the Palestinians, but Israel's history goes way beyond 1948...it is way before the Arab occupation of the Middle East. 3500 year  
  
  
And regarding Gaza, Gaza was originally Egyptian territory.  
After the Yom Kippur war, this territory was forced upon us because the Egyptians did not want the residents in Gaza.  
Until 2005 this area was occupied, after 2005.. Jewish settlers were expelled from Gush Katif (an area that was inside Gaza) and Israel left the strip and the occupation of Gaza ended.  
  
A few months after that, the terrorist organization Hamas was elected president of Gaza.  
And this is where the security problems started.

Scotland,comment,Israel,k8wcgx6,Foosyirdoos,,"Completely switched sides after actually reading the history

For MANY years I was staunchly pro-Palestine as a left leaning person. I never really did much of my own research, and had a bias against Israel because they are strongly allied with the US. (As a leftist, my view on American foreign policy was that pretty much anything the US involved themselves in was bad or questionable. Which, was not a completely unfair assumption, but one that I never fact checked) 

I had thought that after WWII Jews were essentially given Israel, kicked everyone else out, and then the US defended the borders. This was my assumption based on the way people talked about Israel as colonizers with US force behind them. Then I learned in passing, in a completely different setting that had nothing to do with the Israel/Palestine conflict, that Jewish people were actually in the area first! Before Islam even existed. Then I learned that they always had some presence. That started splintering how I felt about things. Nobody ever talked about how Israel actually had a valid claim to the land. I know this is dumb now, but I truly thought that a random place had been chosen and it happened to be where Israel now is. I was vaguely familiar with the significance for Jerusalem, but I am not religious at ALL so I didn't critically think about it.  

Then after Oct 7th I was so horrified and finally sought the story from the very beginning. I sat down with the assumption that Hamas were just terrorists that didn't actually represent the Palestinian people, and that Palestine was a peaceful country. 

Then I actually read from the beginning, like starting from the 5th century to the present day, and I realized why its called the ""Israeli DEFENSE Force."" This whole time, the media I consumed painted Palestinians as total victims but I hadn't realized that there was SO much violence from Palestine/other Arab countries. They originally invaded and conquered, they were hopeful that Hitler would be successful in exterminating Jews, that tons of Jewish people were also displaced from Arab countries, that they were originally offered a two state solution/ refused to collaborate, attacked and then LOST. So many things. Palestinians taking refuge in Syria and Jordan. Causing civil wars. Assassination attempts on the king/other people. That Egypt closed down the border because Palestine was sending in like 4 suicide bombers every week. That the US only began supporting Israel AFTER Israel successfully defended itself from another unprovoked attack which resulted in Egypt sinking tankers into the Suez Canal as revenge and causing an oil shortage in the US. I spend hours on wikipedia clicking though all of the sub stories of the conflict and I honestly could not believe the story had been so successfully spun to view Palestinians as victims. 

Victims even though they voted in Hamas, and that Hamas still has a lot of support in Palestine. I associated terrorist groups with fringe groups, unrepresentative of the sort of middle ground regular population. Imagine my surprise when I learned they were ELECTED! And that Hamas received a greater proportion of the Votes than Biden did in the US election. 

I've increasingly grown less sympathetic to followers of the Islamic faith over time. I struggle to find religious groups that produce as many fanatic murderous supporters that are willing to act on it as Islam. As a whole, the religion is very homophobic with quite a scary amount of Islamic people fully agreeing with some reallllyyyy fucked up shit. I've noticed how strongly religous Islamic communities tend to create problems where they go because they don't integrate super well into European countries who are secular and have a really good thing going BECAUSE of that secularism and western values. I feel like there is something going on with conservative and deeply religious sects of Islam where there is truly no compromise with western values or the western world because to them the consequence is their personal eternal damnation. It breeds such toxicity and extremism.

Scotland is a country with an older population with nearly 70% being over 35 and almost one fifth of the population being over 60. Older people are more likely (but not exclusively) to either not care or support Israel over Palestine. It just seems like every man and their dog is in support of Palestine as the older a person is, the less likely they are to go out and protest against something that doesn't directly affect them. To be clear I'm not saying every person over 35 supports Israel and anyone under supports Palestine, of course there's people on both sides but broadly speaking support for each side tends to be split along those age groups. Older people are also more likely to go out and vote than younger people which is why the UK government has been steadfast in their support for Israel and why labour is even in support of them, because it will gain them support with the groups who actually vote.

Scotland,post,Israel-Palestine,1as4mbz,kilted_queer,Meta: Israel Palestine posts and brigading ,"This is a meta post on potential moderation tools and why some have been used and others haven't.

Before getting into it I appreciate what he mods have done, I feel they generally do a decent job of moderating this place fairly without personal biases. This place could quite awful depending on the mods.            
I'm also not a mod so there might be a reason some of these tools can't be implemented 

But then there is also what only 7 mods? Definitely less than 20.

I don't think anyone on here regardless of views would disagree with the fact that the Israel Palestine posts attract commenters that have never posted here before and at least half of their posts are about the Israel Palestine conflict in various other subs.

From talking to them it seems that the Reddit algorithm is purposefully recommending them posts on the topic because it knows they will engage.           

Even if we reported everyone of these people for brigading, it would still be to much for the Scotland mods to go through the reports and deal with them.

Other subs use commenter restrictions on posts they know will be brigaded (account must have participated in the sub before, higher min karma requirements, must be subbed to the sub etc).

We do that a bit with the general minimum account age but it's quite short (15 days?).

This would stop the brigading in it's tracks and honestly probably reduce a lot of the worst comments on those posts.

There has appeared to be some attempt at applying controls to these threads, some threads have been locked a day or two after the post, fair enough I don't think anything beneficial was coming from the posts anyway.

Others had competition mode applied to them, I thought this was an experiment to reduce brigading but from what I could see It seemed to be applied the day or two after the post was posted, after most people said their piece and worse it hasn't seemed to be applied consistently so all I can see that it achieves is hiding what sentiments are popular on those threads.

Would there be any merit to having a custom flair for Israel Palestine posts that automatically apply controls to the post? Is that even possible?

My final bit is that there has also been plenty of posts to stir the pot and get people riled up
(I'm looking at you person who posted a joke tweet from 9 years ago during the conflict with Isis but made the tweet seem like it was referring to current events.)

Im not sure if there is anything that could or should be done about those misleading posts I'm including that for discussion.

I feel like I could copy a comment chain from a thread in October and paste it in the new daily thread and the discourse would be the same, all the same comments and counter comments being made.

What are other peoples thoughts on the matter?",2024-02-16T09:31:05+00:00
Scotland,comment,Israel-Palestine,kqob9wa,CrispyCrip,,"This is a very fair post and I appreciate the constructive criticism.

As OP and a lot of the other commenters have mentioned, I think one of the best ways to deal with those particular threads is to limit them to subscribers only since it’s also clear to us that the majority of commenters are coming in from outside of the sub. Being completely honest, the reason that crowd control feature hasn’t been used more often is that I forget it’s even an option since it’s relatively new and so hasn’t been absorbed into my workflow yet. 

My current way of dealing with those types of threads was to work my way through all the reports and then just lock the whole post, but that’s definitely not ideal, especially since by the time I get to it the damage has already been done, so in future I will try my best to use the previously mentioned crowd control features to be proactive and deal with those posts before they get to the point of being brigaded. We will no doubt miss a few though, so in that case feel free to message modmail to let us know.

>Would there be any merit to having a custom flair for Israel Palestine posts that automatically apply controls to the post? Is that even possible?

Scotland,comment,Israel-Palestine,kqo3won,Huge_Perception_,,">the Israel Palestine posts attract commenters that have never posted here before and at least half of their posts are about the Israel Palestine conflict in various other subs.

&#x200B;

It is absolutely toxic. Every thread hundreds of posts from users who do not ever post here on other subjects and often only post on that subject across reddit.

It is quite usual for these threads to reach 4 or 500+ comments- a busy political thread does will to be getting 160. A more typical political thread might get 60-90. It just transparently is not the same userbase as the rest of the sub.

Not touching that some of the content posted well crosses the line into outright racism/antisemitism- I have seen the notorious 'from the rivier to the sea' and the Houthis 'death to the west, damnation to all jews, victory for islam' slogans defended and propagated. I am pretty certain those are TOS breaches, but we dont have anything like the moderation to police 500 comment threads. Nor would we want it.

I don't know what the solution is, but if I wanted to read the opinions of dozens of Irishmen, Israelis and Americans on the conflict I would go visit the relevant subs.

That bit is very easily done - you could also limit karma to a certain amount (eg must have at least +5 karma in /r/Scotland in their last 100 posts on Reddit). 

The problem that can't easily be tackled is upvoting/downvoting. The only thing I think you can do is competition mode, which isn't much of a solution (you could also use a script to apply it automatically)",2024-02-16T11:36:01+00:00

- He was advised to give £100-250k to UNICEF for his stated goal of providing humanitarian water aid to Gaza (he had already sent £500k in aid at this point).
- He chose to send £250 k to UNWRA instead, announcing this the same day he was meeting them in Edinburgh.
- His in-laws were given safe passage out of Gaza the day afterwards (the Telegraph brings this up but this is almost certainly a coincidence).
- Scotland doesn't have devolved international aid. We do have an 'Emergency Relief'fund, but this had already been used up after the first £500k had been sent.
- We have a separate 'International development' fund which funds long-running projects in a select few impoverished countries. The SNP government has previously cut down the number of countries in this fund.
- Humza decided to plunder £250k from this fund, despite it already being promised to charities and not being for urgent relief.

Scotland,comment,Hamas,kagp338,jammybam,," EIGHT BBC journalists have accused the corporation of failing to accurately report on the Israel-Hamas conflict in a scathing letter.

In a 2300-word letter sent to Al Jazeera, the UK-based reporters said the BBC is guilty of “double standards in how civilians are seen” given it is “unflinching” in its reporting of alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine.

The letter accuses the BBC of investing more effort in humanising Israeli victims compared with Palestinians, and omitting key historical context in coverage.

 The group apparently does not plan to send the letter to BBC executives.

READ MORE: Ex-BBC editor intervenes in row over Gaza ceasefire calls at Scottish Baftas

The letter reads: ""The BBC has failed to accurately tell this story – through omission and lack of critical engagement with Israel’s claims – and it has therefore failed to help the public engage with and understand the human rights abuses unfolding in Gaza.

 “Thousands of Palestinians have been killed since October 7. When will the number be high enough for our editorial stance to change?”

It comes after the BBC edited out multiple calls for a ceasefire in Gaza from the Scottish Bafta Awards ceremony on iPlayer.

Israel declared war against Hamas after the militant group attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing about 1200 Israelis and taking more than 200 hostage.

It's also reflective of all media in general in the US vs UK.

The scale has already tipped heavily in favour of the Crown, and any further movements in that direction are likely to result in a production line for guilty convictions irrespective of the evidence. 

There are other glaring issues that need to be addressed, and could assist the conviction rate without prejudicing either the accused nor the complainer. Given the recent report about pre-recorded evidence (commission evidence in Scotland) for rape cases, and I believe the statistic was that these resulted in a 20% lower conviction rate; surely this should be an area of focus. It’s clear that juries struggle to connect with complainers through this medium, so perhaps another look needs to be had at this instead of gutting a fundamental pillar of democracy in trial by jury.",2024-01-23T12:18:16+00:00

Concepts of fairness, such as the right to a trial by jury or getting into university based on your grades, can now be sacrificed on the alter of equity of outcome. 

What makes it truly fucking heinous is that its a politically convenient short cut. Juries are biased? Don’t bother educating the public on the nuances of rape, just get rid of juries! Working class kids not going to university? Don’t bother investing in schools in poor areas, just set a lower bar for them at 18! Not enough female politicians? Don’t bother encouraging more women to join political parties, well just have an artificially gender balanced cabinet!

If you devise a system that grants people a fair trial and that system generates a certain number of guilty people and s certain number of innocent people then that is what it was designed for and the numbers are indicative of the process. 

Like how can they just decide that people should be guilty when after a fair trial it's deemed that they are not guilty which is the whole purpose.

It's good that juries actually look at the facts and have the ability to call into question the statements of the case and how they are represented. It's not about feeling bad for people but being able to say, well if that was me in that position I'd feel exceptionally hard done by and don't think they are guilty is exactly why a jury system was selected. 

In the reverse it's why there's very little miscarriages of justice. If the evidence is clear and a whole jury decides beyond a reasonable doubt that you've done something to the point is unanimous there's a good chance you done said thing.",2024-01-23T15:28:50+00:00

This is a very long story cut short. 

But there’s a lot of confusion about this and literally zero tv coverage of events leading up to the current brutality.

The TLDR- Israel’s embattled Benjamin Netanyahu is in deep shit and due to be prosecuted on corruption charges, he failed to win an election and had to stop the opposition forming an alliance with the Arab Israelis in the Knesset 

So certain events took place to get us to where we are today. This all started over a month ago.

There’s load of news so google it and select the google news tab.

Like all news and geopolitical coverage- inform yourself. None of it is secret but our tv channels are awful at covering this stuff with any kind of detail or balanced view


Far right goons are the usual crowd riled up by the likes of Netanyahu to ensure there’s trouble

 https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/middle-east/952779/what-is-happening-sheikh-jarrah-jerusalem-violence

Protesters have gathered nightly in Sheikh Jarrah,” The New York Times (NYT) reports, “clashing with riot police and far-right Israeli groups” over what they consider to be an attempt to “remove thousands of Palestinians from strategic areas in East Jerusalem”.

Jewish settlers argue that the Palestinians are “squatters” and that the area, “which is built beside the tomb of a Jewish high priest from antiquity”, was occupied by Jews until the establishment of Israel in 1948, the paper adds. 



https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/15/world/middleeast/israel-palestinian-gaza-war.html

Twenty-seven days before the first rocket was fired from Gaza this week, a squad of Israeli police officers entered the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, brushed the Palestinian attendants aside and strode across its vast limestone courtyard. Then they cut the cables to the loudspeakers that broadcast prayers to the faithful from four medieval minarets.

It was the night of April 13, the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

All the enriched uranium was already in place,” he said. “But you needed a trigger. And the trigger was the Aqsa Mosque.”


https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/11/what-has-caused-jerusalem-worst-violence-in-years-israel-palestine

What has happened since then?
A month ago, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan began, and Palestinians have complained of what they say are unnecessarily severe restrictions by Israeli police, who prevented them from gathering on steps outside the Old City – an unofficial tradition after evening prayers.

Amid rising tensions, there was an increase in communal violence, with videos shared online of street harassment and several attacks between Jews and Palestinians. Events came to a head in late April when hundreds of far-right Israelis marched down city streets chanting “death to Arabs” and confronted Palestinians


This is just a basic primer, for an insight into the politics the below article is a good start

In a dramatic shift that comes amid fighting in the Gaza strip and clashes between Jewish and Arab citizens in Israel, right-wing kingmaker Naftali Bennett has announced he will no longer seek an alternative government to oust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

And bingo, Netanyahu gets to avoid a coalition that will oust him and all it cost was another war and election which he will fight facing court and as a war time leader.

Israeli demographics are shifting further and further right too, with ultra orthodox jews having more children than secular jews, this will make things alot worse with Palestine and I dont see how you can make things better. You would think that a population whose history was nearly wiped out by the Nazis would have some compassion and not evict people from their homes, refuse them the right to vote and treat them as second class citizens, but thats what the Israeli government has done and alot of the population support it.

What brought many of these peace-loving Israelis to support a shit like Netanyahu. Well look across the barbed wire fences to Gaza and you see Hamas. Supported and supplied from Iran, Hamas is Netanyahu in Palestinian clothing. Hamas never attempts to attack military targets, rather launching their unguided missiles in the direction of the big Israeli cities where they can be virtually certain of hitting something, a civilian target of course.

Right, that's exactly why Hamas started firing rockets at Israel. Bravo, you've cracked the case. 

There's no evidence that events in Sheikh Jarrah, a legal battle which has been going on for decades, or the behaviour of the police when dealing with rioters at Al Aqsa, were manufactured by Netanyahu as some sort of dastardly plan to provoke Hamas into attacking. 

What's more likely is this is Hamas asserting their leadership of the Palestinian resistance and projecting themselves as defenders of Jerusalem. There were supposed to be PA elections this year, 15 years after the last ones, but Abbas cancelled them. This is a Hamas power play. They know that violence against Israel makes them immensely popular among Palestinians, even if it's damaging to their own people in Gaza. But they're more than willing to make that sacrifice, especially as any civilian deaths in Israeli reprisals are a huge propaganda win for them. 

Could Netanyahu benefit from this? Clearly he could. As you note, the alternative coalition is dead as New Right have pulled out, so in all likelihood Israel will go to its fifth election in two and a half years. But he did no engineer this war and he did not start it. It was Hamas who started it, and they are responsible for the bloodshed.",2021-05-20T21:37:28+00:00

Scotland,post,Israel-Palestine Conflict/Conflict,1as4mbz,kilted_queer,Meta: Israel Palestine posts and brigading ,"This is a meta post on potential moderation tools and why some have been used and others haven't.

Before getting into it I appreciate what he mods have done, I feel they generally do a decent job of moderating this place fairly without personal biases. This place could quite awful depending on the mods.            
I'm also not a mod so there might be a reason some of these tools can't be implemented 

But then there is also what only 7 mods? Definitely less than 20.

I don't think anyone on here regardless of views would disagree with the fact that the Israel Palestine posts attract commenters that have never posted here before and at least half of their posts are about the Israel Palestine conflict in various other subs.

From talking to them it seems that the Reddit algorithm is purposefully recommending them posts on the topic because it knows they will engage.           

Even if we reported everyone of these people for brigading, it would still be to much for the Scotland mods to go through the reports and deal with them.

Other subs use commenter restrictions on posts they know will be brigaded (account must have participated in the sub before, higher min karma requirements, must be subbed to the sub etc).

We do that a bit with the general minimum account age but it's quite short (15 days?).

This would stop the brigading in it's tracks and honestly probably reduce a lot of the worst comments on those posts.

There has appeared to be some attempt at applying controls to these threads, some threads have been locked a day or two after the post, fair enough I don't think anything beneficial was coming from the posts anyway.

Others had competition mode applied to them, I thought this was an experiment to reduce brigading but from what I could see It seemed to be applied the day or two after the post was posted, after most people said their piece and worse it hasn't seemed to be applied consistently so all I can see that it achieves is hiding what sentiments are popular on those threads.

Would there be any merit to having a custom flair for Israel Palestine posts that automatically apply controls to the post? Is that even possible?

My final bit is that there has also been plenty of posts to stir the pot and get people riled up
(I'm looking at you person who posted a joke tweet from 9 years ago during the conflict with Isis but made the tweet seem like it was referring to current events.)

Im not sure if there is anything that could or should be done about those misleading posts I'm including that for discussion.

I feel like I could copy a comment chain from a thread in October and paste it in the new daily thread and the discourse would be the same, all the same comments and counter comments being made.

What are other peoples thoughts on the matter?",2024-02-16T09:31:05+00:00
Scotland,comment,Israel-Palestine Conflict/Conflict,kqob9wa,CrispyCrip,,"This is a very fair post and I appreciate the constructive criticism.

As OP and a lot of the other commenters have mentioned, I think one of the best ways to deal with those particular threads is to limit them to subscribers only since it’s also clear to us that the majority of commenters are coming in from outside of the sub. Being completely honest, the reason that crowd control feature hasn’t been used more often is that I forget it’s even an option since it’s relatively new and so hasn’t been absorbed into my workflow yet. 

My current way of dealing with those types of threads was to work my way through all the reports and then just lock the whole post, but that’s definitely not ideal, especially since by the time I get to it the damage has already been done, so in future I will try my best to use the previously mentioned crowd control features to be proactive and deal with those posts before they get to the point of being brigaded. We will no doubt miss a few though, so in that case feel free to message modmail to let us know.

>Would there be any merit to having a custom flair for Israel Palestine posts that automatically apply controls to the post? Is that even possible?

It is absolutely toxic. Every thread hundreds of posts from users who do not ever post here on other subjects and often only post on that subject across reddit.

It is quite usual for these threads to reach 4 or 500+ comments- a busy political thread does will to be getting 160. A more typical political thread might get 60-90. It just transparently is not the same userbase as the rest of the sub.

Not touching that some of the content posted well crosses the line into outright racism/antisemitism- I have seen the notorious 'from the rivier to the sea' and the Houthis 'death to the west, damnation to all jews, victory for islam' slogans defended and propagated. I am pretty certain those are TOS breaches, but we dont have anything like the moderation to police 500 comment threads. Nor would we want it.

I don't know what the solution is, but if I wanted to read the opinions of dozens of Irishmen, Israelis and Americans on the conflict I would go visit the relevant subs.

Scotland,comment,Gaza Genocide/Genocide,kh1sxuj,jammybam,," SCOTTISH Labour’s newest MP should represent his constituents and call for an immediate ceasefire in the Middle East, activists have demanded.

Michael Shanks – who abstained in a Westminster vote on a ceasefire in November - was panned by more than a dozen furious protesters outside Rutherglen Town Hall who branded him a “career politician”.

Amina Khaliq, a member of Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign, insisted his position was “weak” and did not reflect the views of the constituency - Rutherglen and Hamilton West - he was elected to represent in October.

Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar was delivering a speech at the town hall on Monday setting out his party’s priorities for 2024, but he and Shanks were met with chants of “Michael Shanks,  you can’t hide, you’re supporting genocide”. 

It made for an awkward start to the new year for Sarwar after he voted for a ceasefire in the Scottish Parliament.

Police had to be called after protesters attempted to gain entry into the venue.

Khaliq told The National Shanks’ position was “unacceptable”, particularly after Humza Yousaf condemned Israel’s push for “ethnic cleansing”.

She said: “Michael Shanks’s position on Gaza is untenable.

Shanks joined with fellow Labour MP Ian Murray in abstaining from voting on an SNP amendment to the King’s Speech which called for an immediate ceasefire.

Instead, they both backed Keir Starmer’s amendment which instead called for longer humanitarian pauses.

Asked how she felt about Sarwar being unable to command his MPs to vote for a ceasefire, she added: “It shows disunity among the party.

“I think Michael Shanks is a career politician. He put his career before morals and doing the right thing. I think to not call for a ceasefire is a weak position.

“It lacks courage and I think after Humza Yousaf’s comments regarding what’s happening in Palestine as being ethnic cleansing, it’s very strange that Michael Shanks continues to avoid this position and puts his career over people.”

 Following his speech on Monday morning, Sarwar (below) condemned the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for using the conflict in Gaza as a “weapon in his own political game”.

Scotland,comment,Gaza Genocide/Genocide,kh2749f,Euclid_Interloper,,"Well, that's not what's happening either. If Israel were committing 'wholesale slaughter' they wouldn't have displaced over a million people out of the main conflict zone.

Absolutely collateral damage is very high, and it's reasonable to call out Israeli tactics as too indiscriminate. But they are not, as a policy, targeting civilians. The brutal reality of this war is that Hamas, an army of tens of thousands of fighters, uses civilian buildings as military infrastructure. Collateral damage to one degree or another is inevitable. Especially when many civilians willingly or unwillingly are being used as human shields.

And, lets be very, very clear. Israel has mobilised up to half a million personnel. If they were intent on committing genocide, they could have very easily killed the majority of the population by now. Moving people out of the way of the fighting and (eventually) allowing aid into the strip, is NOT genocide.",2024-01-09T15:20:01+00:00

Scotland,comment,Gaza Genocide/Genocide,kh1t4f2,jammybam,," At the same time, he appeared to defend the UK Labour party’s stance.

Speaking to journalists, he said: “The idea that the opposition party in the UK somehow is to blame for the actions of a far right government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, I think trivialises what is a really, really serious and important issue.

 “The tragedy we have right now is just like we have to separate Hamas from the Palestinian people, because they do not represent the Palestinian people who are crying out for peace and crying out for change, neither does Benjamin Netanyahu and his government represent the Israeli people either.”

The ceasefire vote at Westminster November exposed major cracks in Labour as 56 of their MPs voted for the SNP amendment including 10 frontbenchers.

Labour issued a three-line whip to its MPs requiring them not to vote on the SNP amendment and to back the Labour amendment.

Yousaf became the first UK party leader to condemn Israel’s push for “ethnic cleansing”, after warning that Israeli officials had called for the ""resettlement of the population of Gaza"".

 The First Minister called on political leaders to ""stop beating around the bush"" adding that if recent statements from Israeli ministers were ""not tantamount to ethnic cleansing, then I don't know what is"".

On Monday US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said Palestinians must not be pressured into leaving Gaza and must be allowed to return to their homes once conditions allow. His comments followed reports up to 70 people were killed at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.

More than 60 Palestinians were reportedly also killed in the past day in the southern city of Khan Younis.

Jabalia camp has been struck many times since Israel began its war against Hamas following the organisation’s attack on southern Israel on October 7, when some 1200 people were killed.

 More than 22,000 people - mostly women and children - have now been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

Medics, patients and displaced people are also fleeing from the main hospital in central Gaza as the fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants draws closer, witnesses said.

The cynic in me would believe he's had some form of permission from Keith's men to be safe with the vote and back the ceasefire but win a modicum of separation by insisting on his Hamas p.s.

But Sarwars prevarication and mental tug of war vaguery in the lead up to it might suggest his between a rock and a hard place dilemma really has exposed Keith as alone, wrong and badly out of step with not only Labour as a majority in that opinion but the country as a majoritive opinion.

That the Parliament unequivocally condemns in the strongest possible terms Hamas’s barbaric and unjustifiable terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens on 7 October 2023, and demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages; agrees that all human life is equal, abhors the loss of innocent lives, and affirms the right of all Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security; further agrees that the killing of innocent civilians in Gaza, including women and children who have been besieged by Israeli forces, must stop; associates itself with the United Nations Secretary-General’s statements that there must be an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to allow civilians to escape harm, for hostages to be released, for humanitarian aid to reach those in need, and affirming that international humanitarian law, including the Geneva Conventions, must be upheld; reiterates its solidarity with Scotland’s Jewish, Muslim and Palestinian communities and condemns antisemitism, Islamophobia or any other form of hatred; welcomes the Scottish Government’s contribution of £750,000 towards the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East’s flash appeal for Gaza, and the humanitarian assistance announced by the UK Government; reaffirms that a credible, lasting and sustainable peace can only be based on the two-state solution through reinvigorated diplomatic and political efforts in the Middle East Peace Process; agrees with many in the international community that all parties must agree to an immediate ceasefire; recognises that, in order for any ceasefire to work, it requires all sides to comply; is horrified by the Hamas statement that it would repeat the 7 October attacks and continue rocket fire; regrets that Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that he will not even consider a ceasefire; calls, therefore, on the international community to use every form of diplomacy to try and create the conditions on the ground to make a ceasefire a reality; further calls on the International Criminal Court to investigate the conduct of all parties in this conflict, and reaffirms the commitment to a lasting peace and a two-state solution with the end of illegal occupation, siege and settlements.

Vehicles belonging to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) can refuel at hundreds of petrol stations owned by Delek Israel under a contract agreed in 2020.

Delek – The Israel Fuel ­Corporation (referred to henceforth as Delek ­Israel) is part-owned by Israeli ­energy conglomerate, Delek Group, which also owns the Aberdeen-headquartered oil company Ithaca Energy. Delek describes Ithaca as its ­“operational arm” in the North Sea.

 Ithaca was given three UK oil ­licences in October, despite ­existing UN concerns about its parent ­company’s involvement with illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.

Ithaca paid out hundreds of ­millions of pounds in dividends to Delek last year, prompting concerns North Sea oil revenue is going to a firm which – due to its links to the IDF – is implicated in the “horrors” unfolding in Gaza.

Critics including Amnesty International and senior opposition ­politicians have called for Ithaca’s ­licences to be reviewed and potentially revoked in light of our findings.

The awarding of the oil licences to Ithaca was announced by the UK’s North Sea regulator weeks after the attacks on October 7, when Hamas killed around 1200 people, mostly ­Israeli civilians.

More than 34,000 ­Palestinians have now reportedly been killed by the ­Israeli military since the ­Hamas ­attacks which sparked the latest ­escalation of the conflict in Gaza.

Scotland,comment,IDF,l0l5qjc,jammybam,,"Media in Israel reported in June 2020 that Delek Israel and another fuel company had won a tender run by the country’s Ministry of Defense (MoD) to provide refuelling services to the IDF and MoD.

 The exact value of the contract is not known but reports suggest it is worth hundreds of millions of Israeli shekels which would equate to tens or potentially hundreds of millions of pounds.

The original contract between the MoD and Delek Israel was for an ­initial three years from 2020 to 2023, with the option for it to be extended for another two years, according to media reports and Delek’s 2020 ­annual financial report.

Subsequent annual reports do not confirm the extension, but the IDF’s website includes a page ­dedicated to the “complete list” of petrol ­stations where its vehicles can refuel. It ­includes a spreadsheet which lists more than 200 Delek Israel petrol stations across the country which are part of the scheme.

The photo agency Getty ­published a photograph of an IDF ­Hummer being refuelled at a petrol ­station bearing the Delek Israel logo near the border with Gaza on ­November 19, weeks after the Israeli offensive began.

The Ferret understands that the contract primarily allows ­commercial cars used by military personnel to ­refuel. While some all-terrain ­vehicles used in combat could refuel at Delek Israel’s petrol stations, heavier ­armoured vehicles like battle tanks do not.

The Delek Group currently owns around 25% of Delek Israel, ­having sold a large amount of shares in late 2020 due to financial pressures. ­However, the contract to supply fuel to the IDF was signed while Delek Group was still the largest ­shareholder in Delek Israel.

Delek Group was among 112 companies named in a list produced by the UN Human Rights Council of companies where their activities in the occupied West Bank “raised ­particular human rights concerns”.

The West Bank – located on the west bank of the River Jordan near ­Jerusalem – has been occupied by ­Israel since 1967. Israeli settlements in the West Bank are considered ­illegal under international law.",2024-04-21T12:35:28+00:00

Scotland,comment,IDF,l0l5tmo,jammybam,," Conflict between Israeli settlers and Palestinian populations has stretched back decades. But according to the NGO Human Rights Watch, settler violence against Palestinians has ­escalated since October 7 and the Israeli military has either taken part or failed to protect Palestinians from violent attacks in the West Bank.

The UN list – compiled ­after a fact-finding mission to the West Bank – included companies which it assessed were involved in ­activities in the occupied territories which “raised particular human rights concerns”.

DELEK was one of the companies listed because it provided “services and utilities to support the maintenance of Israeli settlements” and was using natural resources in the occupied territories for “business purposes”. A new version of the list was published in June 2023, and Delek was still named as supporting the settlements.

 Delek bought Ithaca Energy in 2017 and it has since grown into one of the biggest oil producers in the North Sea with nearly 600 staff.

Ithaca paid out £320 million in ­dividends to shareholders in 2023 and wants to increase that to nearly £340m in 2024. Delek owns around 88% of Ithaca shares, suggesting it would have been in line for around £280m in dividend payments from Ithaca in 2023.

According to research by think tank Common Wealth, Ithaca is the ninth biggest oil and gas company in the North Sea with stakes in 83 ­licences in total.

The company holds a 20% stake in the controversial ­Rosebank field, north west of Shetland, which was approved by the UK ­Government last year in the face of vocal opposition by climate scientists and campaigners.

 Neil Cowan, the programme ­director for Amnesty International in Scotland, claimed that any North Sea oil licensee with “business links to Israel’s illegal settlements and the war crimes being ­perpetrated in Gaza should expect to lose their licence”.

Cowan added: “By supplying fuel to the Israeli military while ­Israeli ­forces commit war crimes and ­possible ­genocide in Gaza, Delek is ­complicit in those acts, as well as ­Israel’s ­ongoing system of apartheid against the Palestinians, of which the settlements are a key part.

“There must be consequences for anyone here in the UK who is ­actively implicating themselves in the horrors we’re watching unfold – from businesses to UK ministers and officials blatantly flouting their own rules over not exporting UK arms when there’s a clear risk of them being misused.”",2024-04-21T12:36:13+00:00
Scotland,comment,IDF,l0l5w16,jammybam,,"Former Labour shadow chancellor, John McDonnell (below), told The Ferret that if the UK Government is to have “any credibility on human rights these licences must be reviewed in light of the UN’s investigations”.

 “The Government’s handing out of licences to a company engaged in supporting the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank flies in the face of UN resolutions outlawing these settlements and gives a lie to the prime minister’s claims of upholding international law and human rights,” McDonnell claimed.

Ithaca, Delek, the UK Government’s energy department, the ­Israeli embassy in London and the IDF were all asked to comment but none responded.

On its website, Ithaca says it is ­committed to “do[ing] the right things in the right way” and that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are “interwoven into our balanced business strategy”.

Ithaca has adopted the UN’s ­sustainable development goals, ­including to contribute to “peace, ­justice and strong institutions”.

As well as for its activities in the West Bank, Delek has come under fire in recent years for its plans to develop gas fields off the coast of the disputed territory of Western Sahara.

Western Sahara was annexed by Morocco in the 1970s, but its ­sovereignty there is disputed by the indigenous Sahrawi people.

Norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund – built largely on the back of oil revenues – announced it was ­divesting from Delek in December ­because its activities in Western ­Sahara were “a serious violation” of “basic ethical norms”.

Meanwhile, Norway’s state-run oil company, Equinor, is ­partnering with Ithaca on the ­Rosebank field – which Equinor has an 80% stake in – a fact that has drawn growing criticism from both ­campaigners and politicians in the Scandinavian country.",2024-04-21T12:36:47+00:00

“I call on all parties to commit to a ceasefire for the sake of those innocent children who are suffering so badly.”

Joking aside, the pound will still be a valid currency. Much like the Yen, the Dollar and the Euro. All the talk of taking away the pound if Scotland votes 'yes' is unhelpful.

Your question about the Black Watch troops is interesting, with regards to an independant Scotland. From what i understand, the Black Watch merged into the Royal regiment of Scotland.

There are so many flaws to this legally, I don't know where to start, so I'll do the most easy to understand.

1. Changing the birth certificate based on what a person thinks is beyond a shit show as you are in effect revising history.  You can't backdate law as that is unconstitutional and is open to abuse. The UK was forced to adopt this by the ECHR only with medical diagnosis, but not on passports. There is no plausible ethical argument as a baby that doesn't even know what a thumb is let alone if it is transgender.
2. Self cert without impartial requirement of a medical diagnosis is open to abuse.  We are not even allowed to self cert our income for a mortgage, and the last time we did, it was a shit show.
3. Allowing multiple changes over time is also open to so much abuse.
4. The age of 16 is also doomed to fail as they are still legally a minor and not an adult.  The human brain doesn't fully develop until 25 which is when the prefrontal cortex has fully developed, which is the part of the brain responsible for reasoning. (Off topic interesting fact: The evolutionary reason is to make young people make stupid mistakes and learn from them.)

There are loads more but it gets boring and technical.

The SNP knew all of this as they have advisors, and could have watered this down to make it more feasible to pass, but they didn't as they want to play the victim game when it gets rejected on legal grounds, lie and mislead voters for their own interests, which is pretty disgusting as they are there to serve the Scottish people, not themselves and not to play stupid political games and use a marginalised group (under 0.2% of the population) to do it.

Even if Westminster agreed with the principal, they still have to scrutinise it legally and wouldn't pass it due to the numerous flaws in the act, that have obviously been included by the SNP to make it doomed to fail.

This is exactly what Biden did with the student loan forgiveness in the US.  He knew it was not legal, knew it would get thrown out by the Supreme Court and made the legislation so that it would do.  Basically he and the SNP have lied and mislead voters, used and abused certain groups in their lie, and then when it's over, they blame the other side, when all along they implemented a policy they knew would never go through.

As I said, they could have made this more palatable for scrutiny if they really wanted to implement it and make sure it passed, but they didn't.  There has been nothing stopping them implementing a simpler method than the current system, then simplifying it again once that passed, instead of passing something that they knew was not legal.

Scotland,post,Palestine Liberation Organization,35dst6,MadSpline,ZEIT again. Worst German article ever on the SNP landslide - and what you can do about it,"Here is an article in Germany's ZEIT which is full-scale defamatory on the SNP:

http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2015-05/schottland-wahlergebnis-grossbritannien-snp-nationalismus

Google translate:

https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zeit.de%2Fpolitik%2Fausland%2F2015-05%2Fschottland-wahlergebnis-grossbritannien-snp-nationalismus&edit-text=

It goes like that:
""The Scottish liberalism is dead. Populist, egalitarian, elite hostile: The Scottish SNP triumphant because since the failed referendum it pulls the country  into a nationalist frenzy. Reiner Luyken ""

It continues to describe (in somewhat unclear terms) that Charles Kennedy was physically attacked in Kyle of Lochalsh by nationalists before the election. 

>(""Es ging wie hier üblich sehr zivilisiert zu, bis ein nationalistischer Mob ihm und vor allem der konservativen Kandidatin, einer jungen und hochintelligenten Frau, auf den Leib rückte."" 

- ""auf den Leib rücken"" can be used figuratively but the context and the word ""Mob"" implies a physical attack.

Money quote:

> "" The Scottish Labour leader is part of Blair's New Labour wing, from which you otherwise can not hear much. The modern Scottish Labour Party is as liberal as the Liberals and the Conservatives in the north to the south of the populous small and geographically large country in the north of the Kingdom. Scotland's voters have this basic consensus discarded. **The ideology of the party [SNP], which they threw themselves into the arms of the majority, is a modern Nazism Light.** Populist, egalitarian, elite hostile and the moral superiority of their own nation glorifying.""

One can comment on that (and many people did that already). But there is something else one can do, and I'd encourage all SNP supporters and supporters of Scottish Independence to do that: You can submit a formal complaint to the Deutscher Presserat.

The [German Press Council](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Presserat) is an official organ of German newspapers which, among other things, watches that the members keep minimum ethical standards in reporting. For example, if there happens a tragedy like the [Love Parade disaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Parade_disaster) and some yellow press newspapers show graphical photos of dying people, they will get a reprimand by Deutscher Presserat. I think that the article from ZEIT (which is not even marked as ""opinion"") is not ethical because it links falsely, and against evidence, the Scottish independence movement with nazist and xenophobe movements while not telling anything about the real reasons for that landslide. Getting a reprimand from Presserat would be a painful slap for ZEIT which considers itself still as *""Liberal Quality Press""*.

Why is this important? Germany's ZEIT is actually important in forming political opinions and is read by many influential people. And this article from Luyken is not the first of its kind but the fourth or fifth in a series, and the sentiment is echoed in some other conservative newspapers.

To be fair, much of the German press reported much friendlier about the SNP but the independence movement is often described as ""nationalist"" (and in German that always means chauvenistic, xenophobe nationalism of the ""we better than them"" kind, otherwise it would be described as ""independence movement"" or ""autonomy movement"").

Boo hoo, I say.  If you're going to support nationalism then you need to accept the criticism for it.  I don't believe in this ""civic nationalism division"" that we try to use in Scotland to legitimise it.  It's purely academic.  Fundamentally there's just a ball hairs difference between this and ""nazism light"", and it's only strong control and effective leadership that can stop its natural progression of descending into something much more ugly.  It's within our human nature.  The Germans understand this better than anyone, I should think.

As for the money quote;
>The ideology of the party [SNP]... ...is a modern Nazism Light. **Populist, egalitarian, elite hostile and the moral superiority of their own nation glorifying.**

Adding my own emphasis, I think it's a fair comparison to make.  The only qualifier I would add is that at the moment it's still just a similarity, rather than direct manifestation.  Part of the obstacle is that it's almost impossible (in the western world, at least) to draw comparisons to nazism without evoking a hyper emotional and moral response.",2015-05-09T11:50:33+00:00
Scotland,comment,Palestine Liberation Organization,cr3h3g9,MadSpline,,"Some notions and words are completely burned in German, like ""people"" or ""leader"". That the SNP has the word ""national"" in its name is pretty unfortunate here from a PR point of view. ""Socialist"" is burned twice on the other hand because of the totalitarism of the GDR with its SED. It is a miracle that the word ""social"" hasn't gone taboo as well.

However, for a newspaper with the ressources of ZEIT it is a no-brainer to look up the true background of SNP and it political leanings which would be described best as social-democratic in German notions. Maybe it is a pretty bad misunderstanding. What I think is that big money circles are probably not comfortable at all with the idea with a non-neoliberal party getting hold in Scotland, and perhaps even being politically and economically successful. There are many influential people who wouldn't like that. (And apart from that, there are also strategic reasons to worry about the future of an EU with a split UK but politicians should know better than just trying to turn the clock back into some comfortable idea about the past).

Scotland,comment,Palestine Liberation Organization,cr3he58,MadSpline,,"So, where would you draw the line between saying that the interests of the own country are not represented well in the union, and nationalism?

It's certainly not the invention of the SNP that Scotland is a nation on its own. It is also clear that there are important political differences between Scotland and other parts of the UK. Do you think that autonomy is in all cases the wrong way to go? For example, if Tibet tries to secede from China, would you support that or not? On which grounds?

And just to check the argument, if the UK has oil and benefits from it, what would be your argument against that the UK would be joined with other countries from the EU and the oils resources used by all of them? Are you against the idea of national states? And isn't it nationalistic if the UK wants to have certain special rights within the EU?

To be clear, I agree that nationalism of the form ""we are better than them"" is dangerous. But if it is more like ""we want to decide by ourselves in which society we want to live in"", I don't have a problem with it. Nations are usually hold together by having mutual advantages. If there are no clear advantages for some part of a union, there is probably something wrong.

E: In case it's not clear, I don't support this party or the policies mentioned below in any way.  
2E: Maybe fixed the link?  


Family life underpins our society, and the government must not interfere. The rest of this document concerns how we, as a government, would interfere with family life.

**Children**

* Children should not have state systems in place to protect them from abuse
* Children should not have the right to privacy until 16 years. In fact, this whole idea of “children’s rights” is damaging to society.
* Children should not have access to medical care if they are afraid of information being shared with their parents. In particular, a child’s parents should be informed before she can be given access to abortion.
* Parents should be allowed to beat their children hard enough to leave lasting marks
* Parents should be allowed to belittle, ridicule, and frequently explode in anger at their children without interference from the state. If you want to raise a person to believe that their opinions, feelings & views are worthless, and make them feel they are useless, that’s your right as a parent.

**Schools & Education**

* The government should give parents “a substantial payment” to not send their kids to nursery.
* Parents should be supported, even encouraged, to homeschool their kids. Unless it’s as a result of a pandemic. Because then we need to reopen schools immediately because “children need to be taught properly in school”.
* Children should be taught specific classes in critical thinking and logic, but definitely not in relation to ""contemporary political and social issues"". And not implicitly as part of an exploration-based CfE.
* Children “should not be taught what to think”, except when it comes to Christian values such as “respect for authority, obedience, courtesy and good manners… gratitude, respect and obedience towards parents… courage, integrity, faithfulness, loyalty, gratitude, politeness, prudence, temperance, generosity, compassion, humility and tolerance”
* Furthermore, state schools should not be allowed to teach the state’s values (i.e. environmentalism, equality, women's & children's rights, etc). Instead they should be taught about the virtues of marriage, the evils of sexual promiscuity, the dangers of abortion, “alternative views” on LGBT issues, and the dangers of taking on debt (?!)
* Conversely, both Catholic and independent schools should be allowed to teach ~~our~~ their own values unhindered, and should be given tax breaks and also be state funded.
* The university sector should be reduced in size, although we should be training more experts, nurses, etc in Scotland and not relying on immigrants.
* People should be encouraged to attend their “local university” (??) so that they don’t have to leave their hometown for higher education, in order to be around in 40 years' time to care for their ageing parents.
* That said, young people should be strongly encouraged to move out to rural and remote areas.

**Marriage**

* Heterosexual relationships should be solemnised by *proper* marriage, not those weak-ass civil partnerships The Gays get.
* Family life and children’s wellbeing are important issues (See above), so we’re going to make it much harder for couples with irreconcilable differences to get a divorce.
* People should be allowed to psychologically abuse their spouses, to humiliate and degrade them, and make them financially dependent on staying in the relationship.

**Scotland’s ageing population problem**

* People without children should pay extra taxes to offset the damage they’re doing by not producing extra taxpayers.
* Conversely, people with children should be given tax reliefs, more in benefits (proportional to the number of weans they pump out), and more discounts & free entry to state-funded kids’ attractions.
* While it’s crucial to do everything we can to encourage increased birth rates, this does not extend to funding fertility treatment for single and gay people on the NHS. Ew.
* Similarly, married, heterosexual couples should get “preference” when selecting adoptive/foster parents, because regardless of their “moral … beliefs”: they’ll unilaterally make better parents than unmarried people or The Gays.
* Life is so precious that abortion and assisted suicide should be criminal offenses under any circumstances. That said, we are against the use of dead people’s organs without their explicit permission in order to save lives. Because that’s going too far and is a VIOLATION of people’s rights over their own bodies.

**Crime & justice**

* Did you know there’s a “hate incident” system as part of hate crime laws? We are VERY familiar with it, and we’re not big fans.
* We’re particularly not keen on the harassment section of hate crime legislation.
* We will tackle Scotland’s “alcohol problem”, not by introducing any laws, but by delivering frequent stern lectures about the immorality of drunkenness. Warning people that drunkenness can lead to “sexual misadventures” will definitely discourage alcohol use, particularly amongst young people.
* Prostitution should be criminalised, but not punished. (Solicitation, however, should be illegal and punished)
* Controversial idea: “Prisons should be free of illegal drugs.”
* We’re not totally on-board with this idea of “human rights”.
* We’re definitely not on-board with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

**Culture**

* We’re still angry that women want to join our golf clubs
* It’s only natural that men want to work longer hours, in more dangerous jobs, while women prefer to Make Baby. The government should really stop looking into gender inequalities in the workplace.
* Immigrants contribute much to our culture, such as family values, responsibility, education and a hardworking attitude. However they must fully integrate with traditional Scottish culture and assimilate, which we will encourage by “diffusing \[them\] geographically”. It goes without saying they should learn English, but we’ll say it anyway.
* The BBC is biased against our views which we're not happy about… we should remove the requirement that broadcasters should be politically neutral so that we can make our own channels, with ~~hookers and blackjack~~ judgement and prayer
* The BBC’s children’s programming is too political.
* Channel 4 should stop showing softcore porn. Have you seen it? Disgusting. I watch it all the time. For research.

**Environmentalism**

* While we *obviously* support environmentalism, it shouldn’t be taught in schools.
* The government should do more to promote the use of private (sic) transport.
* A reduction in divorces will help solve global warming. Checkmate, liberals.",2021-04-07T15:30:52+00:00

Wales,comment,Israel,fw1re9j,EverythingIsByDesign,,"There are two strands to the truth in this debate.

1.

2. Amnesty have never reported the police officers, or the police force, in the George Floyd case were trained by Israeli special forces or that the particular kneeling technique used to lethal effect in the George Floyd case is taught/encouraged by Israeli special forces for use by police in the USA.

Regardless of those truths she has a track record of prejudicing against the Jewish community and her use of the term ""we"" in the tweet makes it patently clear she is trying to talk for more than just herself and she is trying to co-opt the BLM movement to fighting other injustices.",2020-06-26T10:12:40+00:00
Wales,comment,Israel,fw1rj3w,FRANCIS___BEGBIE,,">What I don't understand, is how stating Israeli organisations trained american cops in a choke technique is antisemitic?

That's a crucial question, and it's a complex issue. The IHRA put it best, which is the global standard for defining antisemitism:

[""Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is **often used to blame Jews for “why things go wrong**”](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/working-definition-antisemitism)

The tweet draws an unnecessary parallel between the social ills of country A (USA) and attributes them to the teachings of Israel (the 'Jewish collective' in the IHRA definitions) to propagate the idea of a Jewish collective exercising control over the world. It's pure fantasy. No doubt American police officers have training from all kinds of individuals and organisations, none of which they are obliged to adopt, and I have no doubt that those officers who were trained by Israelis were told to take their knees off someone's neck if the guy couldn't breathe. It is America that is responsible for it's Police Officers killing black people, not Israel.

*(I'm going to have to do a Godwin here, but it's entirely relevant to demonstrate how antisemitism developed historically)*

It was Goebell's go-to tactic. This notion of the 'hidden Jewish enemy' pulling the levers of government from the diaspora and making life difficult for German people. Yes, in this instance she's referring to Israel, not the religion, but see the above definition of a 'Jewish collective'. If the Nazis had Israel to target (it wasn't a country until 1948) they would have used that too. Also, their hatred of Jews was less along religious grounds and more along ideological and racial grounds, much like a lot of the bile that gets spouted these days. In other words, it's far easier to obfuscate antisemitism as run of the mill state-based opposition, than it is to be openly hateful of Judaism.",2020-06-26T10:14:54+00:00

On one hand it's not wrong for Palestinians to be free from hurt and pain and loss and families being killed. The Jewish people too want that on their side and both sides deserver peace. 

But there was a youtube clip I saw today - of a gentleman who was the son of a Hamas leader speaking to CNN I believe. He is the son of the Founder of Hama's, he goes on to explain how he was treated like a prince, but he saw how very little the Hama's cared for the people of Palestine. How little they cared for life. 

He went' to prison and converted to Christianity and wants peace for the Palestinian people. If you go and look at Youtube there and look for Mosab Hassen Yousef you will see plenty of youtube vids of hos journey if you will. 

For him to tell you - one who has lived inside the life as a Hama's soldier and how little they care for life is so telling. 

For me life on both sides is so precious and the quicker they realise how little the Hamas leaders care whilst living the rich life in Qatar is so telling.

Peace needs to be achieved on both sides and that's not easy with what has happened today and last week and in the past.

Wales,comment,Israel-Palestine,e38w9w6,,,"Man, the effort to respond to all of this would be far too much for a Sunday. Whilst there are good policies in here, there's also a lot of polices which seem pretty nutty to me. In particular, social policies, the support for privatisation, and the disregard for human rights internationally.

For instance:

>Require all school pupils to pledge allegiance to Queen and Country at the start of school: “I pledge allegiance to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I will respect our rights and freedoms. I will uphold our democratic values. I will observe our laws faithfully and fulfil my duties as a British citizen, for Queen and Country. So help me God.” The home nations can also have their own respective pledge of allegiances, for example in Texas were pupils pledge allegiance to the US and to the state of Texas

Why? Not only would this not achieve anything(kids would find it a waste of time), but attempting to instil an uncritical devotion to the country is daft. People shouldn't observe the laws of the UK if the laws are unjust, and shouldn't have to ""fulfil their duties""(Whatever that means), if the duties involve acting injustly.

What's more, the references to the Queen and God are a bit strange. A lot of the country are republicans, and even more don't believe in God, so it really fails at representing the majority of the population(certainly the majority of the population who attend school).",2018-07-29T17:53:48+00:00

Wales,comment,Israel-Palestine,e39jaej,Eurovision2006,,"**The Economy**
- I don’t like VAT, but okay
- Income yes, corporation no
- All for decentralisation
- Definitely
- Why?
- I don’t see the need and I’m pretty sure it’s more costly

**Foreign Affairs and Defence**
- The Commonwealth is for countries with ties to the UK by being former colonies, not the new British Empire
- Yes
- Not sure
- Development aid is more important than wars
- Only European country along with Belarus not part of the ECHR?
- Fuck no
- No opinion
- Definitely

**International Trade**
- Fine
- Stay in the EU. Why not proficiency in Welsh areas as well? Not that I support either.
- **North American* Free Trade Area. Why not join that massive trade bloc that you are a lot more connected with?
- Don’t care about the Commonwealth, but it seems like you just want the British Empire back
-I guess?

**Health**
- No, single-payer
- Nope
- One word. America
- The government can afford the hundreds of thousands that child would cost, but not an abortion? This just punishes poor women who are often those in most need of an abortion.
- Yes, but I feel like there’s some catch

**Education**
- That is fair
- Just have it from general taxation
- I’d like grants for all and a very affordable loan system like in Sweden
- I don’t know enough
- Definitely. It seems like such a mess now
- I don’t see a problem
- I hate the obsession with Mandarin. For the vast majority of people, it will never be useful and a traditional European one would be much better. I would like to see however everyone studying a native Celtic language. This is an idea often suggested in Spain to increase national unity
- Yes
- No. That won’t do anything. Would teaching them something a bit more useful and important than how to kill someone not be better?
- God no
- No, race to the bottom
- That sounds good as long as it includes all of the ugly stuff of the British Empire which you sort of seem to be including with the Scottish and Irish history parts.
- Definitely
- NO.
- FUCK NO.

**Immigration**
- Not against it, but why are they okay and not your European neighbours?
- No
- I think you have to do this in a lot of countries, so I guess that’s fine
- Don’t know
- Why are they okay?
- I think so. Canada does it
- I don’t know enough about it
- You do realise that a lot of people go to an English-speaking country to learn English?
- Yes
- No
- No
- No

**Media**
- I’d like it increased
- For God’s sake
- Nope
- I guess so
- Okay
- Again one word. America
- I think so

**Culture**
- I want smoking banned in public areas. That means outdoors as well. There should be specific areas they have to go to where all non-smokers can easily avoid not being forced to breathe in their smoke
- No, decrease it
- Yes
- Why?
- Don’t know
- Do these actually exist?
- Not sure
- Maybe
- Have them as public holidays in all parts of the UK
- Too many bank holidays
- I think that’s a good idea

**Sport**
- Sure
- Why not

**Constitutional Affairs**
- I definitely support a written constitution
- Yes
- Yes
- No. AV is practically just as bad as FPTP. Have either STV or a list system
- Too small
- STV everywhere
- I don’t know about them
- I think that could lead to something like Italy where nothing happens
- Not really needed in STV
- Maybe
- I’ve always liked the ideas of that, but it’s not done anywhere apart from America, I think
- Yes
- Yes
- In
- I prefer Department
- Just get rid of it all together
- England’s too big to get the same as the other three

**Welfare**
- No
- Yes
- No
- Not sure
- Yes
- I think I support that
- No. If you’re paying into the system, you should get the benefits
- No. Veterans shouldn’t get special treatment. I’m not saying that they shouldn’t get what you said, but I don’t see why everyone isn’t deserving of that.

**The Monarchy**
- Yes
- Yes
- Yes
- Yes
- Yes
- Yes

**England and Local Government**
- No. About nine regions with similar powers to the Welsh Assembly
- I’d prefer for the counties to be made into something smaller and for all of them to have directly-elected mayors
- Yes
- I think so

**Law and Order**
- I’m open to the idea
- I don’t understand
- Sentencing based on the crime just doesn’t make sense. Somebody should be in prison for as long as is needed to rehabilitate them, not to punish them
- Maybe
- Base it on a regional level
- Yes
- No opinion
- No. Want to be the second Western democracy to have one of the greatest human rights violations?
- No. The longest sentence should be 21 years, except when they pose a very clear threat to society obviously. That’s what it is in Norway and they have the lowest recidivism rates in the world
- That’s just stupid. What good does it do? Remove them from their family and friends and force them back into crime? Besides how would you enforce it?
- No long sentences
- No life sentences
- Yeah, cause the tough approach always works out
- Unarmed police work great
- I guess so
- A cultural change is more important than locking people up. Not that we shouldn’t do that
- Yes
- Yes
- Nope. The ideal society is one without guns

**Transport**
- I don’t know enough
- I think so
- Definitely

**Energy**
- Renewable all the way

**Scotland**
- Not sure
- They have more sense than that
- Yes
- Yes
- Yes
- I don’t know about it
- I don’t know about it
- Okay

**Wales**
- Definitely
- Yep
- Nope

**Northern Ireland**
- Yes
- If you wouldn’t mind
- Yes
- Yes

However, since Brexit; and to a lesser extent the Scottish independence vote; the UK government has been actively pursuing a ""British"" first idea.

But now, its got crazy imho with 3+ ""judges"" on a property; planning, engineering, cadw + local + political.

What is intriguing, is watching olde building ""slowly die"" as parties unable to even move as owner or for sale. Notable around here in Llandeilo..
- Olde Market Llandeilo = empty for decade ++++
- NatWest Bank Llandeilo = Listed (nobody wanna touch)
- Olde HSBC bank = Listed = Unoccupied Decay 
- Plas Taliaris = Listed = Unoccupied Decay 

Its noted that Cadw is part of the ""Culture Tourism Group"", with probably more powers on a project that a ""qualified planning+structural engineer"".

I still think the ""motive"" is correct in preservation, ""the look and feel"", rather that a museum piece.

Whats really miff's me is the ""olde market"" in Llandeilo
- For Sale + Empty for years
- Kids wanna go in there and play (ball + SOLID wall)
- kids being kids.. and having fun and using empty space..
- Its a buiness proposal + Planning Application (flats=no, warehouse=no, etc=)

Its probably a testament to how ""stuck"" things have got,

Wales,post,West Bank,92w4ik,ScottishBrexitor,My Policies to Make Britain Great Again!,"Hello there! These are my policies to make Britain Great Again!

But beware! These policies aren't suitable to liberals or anyone leaning left on the political spectrum, so read at your own risk! You have been warned!


**The Economy**

* Replace VAT with a Local Sales Tax, set by the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties with freedom to vary the rate according to their spending needs

* Lower income and corporation taxes by 5% to allow subnational bodies to have their own local rates

* Decentralise the UK economy by moving civil service jobs out of London and encourage and set up new financial districts in Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Glasgow to with the goal for these cities to rival London

* Rename the Bank of England to the Bank of the United Kingdom (Bank UK)

* Replace English, Scottish, Northern Irish and UK territorial banknotes with a single UK currency banknote like we have with coins with its introduction set after the death of Queen Elizabeth II

* Reintroduce the £1 note into circulation

**Foreign Affairs and Defence**

* Support the existence of the Commonwealth of Nations, and will work for closer ties with the member states of the Commonwealth, while also being open to any application from countries who share the values of the Commonwealth for membership

* Work with international community to have a two-state solution to the Israel/Palestine and support Israel’s right to exist while refusing recognition of the Palestine state until they are fully democratic and committed to peaceful ways to resolving the conflict

* Recognise the Republic of Somaliland as a sovereign state and encourage the international community support its recognition

* Commit to spend 2% GDP on defence and increase annually by 0.5% provided GDP continues to rise

* Withdrawal from European Court of Human Rights

* Open internment camps in British Overseas Territories including a camp in the British Antarctic Territory for extraordinarily dangerous people operated by the military

* Seperate the Specialist Operations directorate from the London Metropolitan Police Service to its own agency H.M Specialist Operations (H.M.S.O) with responsibility for the protection of the Houses of Parliament, Downing Street, Whitehall, Buckingham Palace, the senior members of the British Royal Family, members of The Cabinet, other ministerial members of Her Majesty's Government and the Parliaments and administrations of the Home Nations, while moving responsibility of co-ordinating and leading on UK-wide national counter-terrorism matters to the National Crime Agency allowing the Met to focus on general policing in the Greater London region

* Give the citizens of Gibraltar and the Crown dependencies a referendum on becoming fully British, and having representation in the Houses of Parliament including their own MPs in the lower house and representation in the upper house

**International Trade**

* Support and negotiate the purposed CANZUK Group consisting of the Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom which sees cooperation between the four nations on free trade, foreign policy, constitutional affairs and freedom of movement

* Join EFTA, allowing us access to the four freedoms of the EU while allowing us the freedom to seek other trade deals with foreign countries, put in place restrictions on freedom of movement and if possible seek to negotiate further restrictions such as proof of proficiency in the English language

* Seek to join NAFTA, allowing us access to Canadian, American, Mexican markets once its future is secure and the CPTPP trade agreement, a signed, but not-yet ratified, trade agreement between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam giving us access to their markets once ratified

* Support and negotiate the creation of the Commonwealth Free Trade Association, which will massively boost trade between Commonwealth nations

* Recommission the Royal Yacht Britannia used to sign new trade deals and privately funded via donations at no tax payers expense

**Health**

* Set up a commission to look into reforming the NHS into a social insurance model of universal healthcare for citizens which subsidises most healthcare costs as opposed to an outdated health service with different NHS plans available for citizens as well as specific plans for children, students, the disabled and the retired

* Introduce a flat NHS levy of 2% of income for additional funding of the NHS with opt outs available for individuals who use private insurance

* Encourage strong competition in free market healthcare to drive up standards and encourage more Britons to opt for private health insurance

* No NHS funding for abortions unless a victim of rape, the baby is life threatening to the mother or foetal abnormalities. Illegal after 24 weeks unless life threatening, or foetal abnormalities occur

* Allow foreign nationals with legal rights to work in the UK to have full access to NHS treatment provided they pay the 2% NHS levy

**Education**

* Introduce a Tuition Fee Equality bill to have UK universities charge all UK students the same rate for tuition fees as a resident of any other EU country, regardless of which part of the UK they are from

* Replace tuition fees with a flat graduate tax. This will be done by setting up a 'Higher Education Agency' which will fund higher education in England in which all UK graduates who graduated from English universities earning above £25,000 would pay into through a flat 5% levy on their annual income and also donations of other bodies. Seek to link this agency to its Scottish counterpart SAAS and Welsh and Northern Irish counterparts to make fee collecting easier for students who study in other parts of the UK

* Reintroduce maintenance grants for poor students undertaking higher education

* Scrap UCAS to allow universities and colleges to have their own systems of processing applications and admissions

* Merge all English examination boards into a new single ‘National Education Authority’, an executive non-departmental public body responsible for accrediting educational awards, overseeing the national curriculum and recommendation of salaries, holiday and school hours while leaving the choice to schools and local councils themselves, also set up separate singles exam boards for Wales and Northern Ireland while maintaining the SQA in Scotland

* Allow teachers at the primary stage the freedom to teach in areas they have specialist knowledge of and on news and current affairs

* Require primary and secondary schools to teach all pupils two modern languages from Year 1 including Mandrian and one of French, German or Spanish

* Require all secondary schools to have Accounting, Economics, Engineering and Psychology available at GCSE and A-level

* Introduce new military schools for pupils between the ages of 12 and 17 who have committed serious crimes and/or have been expelled from state schools three times were they can learn military trades

* Encourage new schools to enter the education market and compete for pupils provided they are granted a license by the local council

* Allow state schools and councils to have more control over their pupil and staffing rolls and salaries to compete for teachers across the UK and around the world, with recommendations set up by administrations of the home nations and salary regulations set out by local governments

* History classes at primary and secondary to have a bigger emphasis on British history including Anglo Saxon Kingdoms, the English Civil War, Scottish Wars of Independence, history of the Monarchy, Union of Crowns, Act of the Union, Irish Wars of Independence, Northern Ireland Troubles

Wales,comment,West Bank,e38w9w6,,,"Man, the effort to respond to all of this would be far too much for a Sunday. Whilst there are good policies in here, there's also a lot of polices which seem pretty nutty to me. In particular, social policies, the support for privatisation, and the disregard for human rights internationally.

For instance:

>Require all school pupils to pledge allegiance to Queen and Country at the start of school: “I pledge allegiance to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I will respect our rights and freedoms. I will uphold our democratic values. I will observe our laws faithfully and fulfil my duties as a British citizen, for Queen and Country. So help me God.” The home nations can also have their own respective pledge of allegiances, for example in Texas were pupils pledge allegiance to the US and to the state of Texas

Why? Not only would this not achieve anything(kids would find it a waste of time), but attempting to instil an uncritical devotion to the country is daft. People shouldn't observe the laws of the UK if the laws are unjust, and shouldn't have to ""fulfil their duties""(Whatever that means), if the duties involve acting injustly.

What's more, the references to the Queen and God are a bit strange. A lot of the country are republicans, and even more don't believe in God, so it really fails at representing the majority of the population(certainly the majority of the population who attend school).",2018-07-29T17:53:48+00:00

- I don’t like VAT, but okay
- Income yes, corporation no
- All for decentralisation
- Definitely
- Why?
- I don’t see the need and I’m pretty sure it’s more costly

**Foreign Affairs and Defence**
- The Commonwealth is for countries with ties to the UK by being former colonies, not the new British Empire
- Yes
- Not sure
- Development aid is more important than wars
- Only European country along with Belarus not part of the ECHR?
- Fuck no
- No opinion
- Definitely

**International Trade**
- Fine
- Stay in the EU. Why not proficiency in Welsh areas as well? Not that I support either.
- **North American* Free Trade Area. Why not join that massive trade bloc that you are a lot more connected with?
- Don’t care about the Commonwealth, but it seems like you just want the British Empire back
-I guess?

**Health**
- No, single-payer
- Nope
- One word. America
- The government can afford the hundreds of thousands that child would cost, but not an abortion? This just punishes poor women who are often those in most need of an abortion.
- Yes, but I feel like there’s some catch

**Education**
- That is fair
- Just have it from general taxation
- I’d like grants for all and a very affordable loan system like in Sweden
- I don’t know enough
- Definitely. It seems like such a mess now
- I don’t see a problem
- I hate the obsession with Mandarin. For the vast majority of people, it will never be useful and a traditional European one would be much better. I would like to see however everyone studying a native Celtic language. This is an idea often suggested in Spain to increase national unity
- Yes
- No. That won’t do anything. Would teaching them something a bit more useful and important than how to kill someone not be better?
- God no
- No, race to the bottom
- That sounds good as long as it includes all of the ugly stuff of the British Empire which you sort of seem to be including with the Scottish and Irish history parts.
- Definitely
- NO.
- FUCK NO.

**Immigration**
- Not against it, but why are they okay and not your European neighbours?
- No
- I think you have to do this in a lot of countries, so I guess that’s fine
- Don’t know
- Why are they okay?
- I think so. Canada does it
- I don’t know enough about it
- You do realise that a lot of people go to an English-speaking country to learn English?
- Yes
- No
- No
- No

**Media**
- I’d like it increased
- For God’s sake
- Nope
- I guess so
- Okay
- Again one word. America
- I think so

**Culture**
- I want smoking banned in public areas. That means outdoors as well. There should be specific areas they have to go to where all non-smokers can easily avoid not being forced to breathe in their smoke
- No, decrease it
- Yes
- Why?
- Don’t know
- Do these actually exist?
- Not sure
- Maybe
- Have them as public holidays in all parts of the UK
- Too many bank holidays
- I think that’s a good idea

**Sport**
- Sure
- Why not

**Constitutional Affairs**
- I definitely support a written constitution
- Yes
- Yes
- No. AV is practically just as bad as FPTP. Have either STV or a list system
- Too small
- STV everywhere
- I don’t know about them
- I think that could lead to something like Italy where nothing happens
- Not really needed in STV
- Maybe
- I’ve always liked the ideas of that, but it’s not done anywhere apart from America, I think

**Welfare**

- Yes
- Yes
- Yes

**England and Local Government**

- I’d prefer for the counties to be made into something smaller and for all of them to have directly-elected mayors
- Yes
- I think so

**Law and Order**
- I’m open to the idea
- I don’t understand
- Sentencing based on the crime just doesn’t make sense. Somebody should be in prison for as long as is needed to rehabilitate them, not to punish them
- Maybe
- Base it on a regional level
- Yes
- No opinion
- No. Want to be the second Western democracy to have one of the greatest human rights violations?
- No. The longest sentence should be 21 years, except when they pose a very clear threat to society obviously. That’s what it is in Norway and they have the lowest recidivism rates in the world
- That’s just stupid. What good does it do? Remove them from their family and friends and force them back into crime? Besides how would you enforce it?
- No long sentences
- No life sentences
- Yeah, cause the tough approach always works out
- Unarmed police work great
- I guess so
- A cultural change is more important than locking people up. Not that we shouldn’t do that
- Yes

Wales,comment,West Bank,e39j98h,Fireflydog,,"As a teacher, and someone who has advised on the curriculum; I've argued every year for the last 10 to include proper Welsh history; but Labour and Tory, are British Nationlists; they fight tooth and nail not to include anything that bolsters regional pride. . . Tories because it undermines ""Britain"" and Labour because it makes Immigrants feel unwelcome.   


However, since Brexit; and to a lesser extent the Scottish independence vote; the UK government has been actively pursuing a ""British"" first idea. It's core goals being the erosion of national pride of the home nations in favour of a British national pride ( trade one nationalism for another ).   


For example, one policy is replacing ""made in Wales/Scotland/England"" with a ""Made in Britain"" logo. ",2018-07-30T00:30:47+00:00

My coal miner father, didn't benefit from the state in the 80's; especially after he got near crippled and had to be consistently harassed by the benefits office to prove how disabled he was... and you would put him on food stamps?

What is it that the Biden administration is doing NOW that makes you think there is anything like the same justification for boycotting as with Iran’s morality police killing 277 people over 8 weeks of national protests in defense of the right to women’s autonomy over all aspects of their lives?

Wales,post,Occupation,3o3w66,jw205,Creating the Welsh 'Baraka',"Hi Everybody! 

I am currently in development for film inspired by a documentary that many of you may know called 'Baraka', a film that is *""A collection of expertly photographed scenes of human life and religion.""*

For those of you that have not watched it, here is a link to the full film on Youtube - http://bit.ly/1LDEOuh - I highly recommend giving it a watch. 

The film is essentially a Welsh Baraka.  Documenting in extreme beauty all the things that makes Wales, Wales. From the intense atmosphere of the Welsh rugby team playing at the Millennium Stadium, to the vast rural landscapes of Snowdonia. 

So i have come here to see what you guys would like to see in this film.  What occupations, landscapes, crafts, places, people, topics, traditions, products etc represent Wales in its finest form and the film would be complete without. The film will be a 15 minute piece, so send me your thoughts!

Wales,post,Occupation,13sus3z,leopardprintcactus,The cause and origins of anti-Welsh prejudice in early England and how this manifested in society.,"I found some really interesting and informative articles written by historians about the cause of anti- Welsh prejudice in early Saxon England. If you don't want to read the whole post, there's a TLDR and a quote summary.

I've quoted from the various articles and essays and linked the full articles at the end.

*(As you are probably aware 'Welsh' is the name given by the Saxons to native Britons. The terms 'native Briton' and 'Britons' and 'Welsh' are used interchangeably in the articles, but mean the same thing. The Norman invasion worsened prejudice against the Welsh living in Wales, but their prejudice against the Welsh was rooted in a different motivation.*)

This refers to the era from when the Saxons first came to Britain and Britons/ Welsh lived in English society up until the 10th century, after which 'Welsh' people were no longer recognised as a separate group in England.

**TLDR:**

* **Anti- Briton/ Welsh prejudice in this era was caused by a belief system that justified the Saxons colonising and replacing the Briton/ Welsh population during the 5th century. It included religious elements such as believing the Britons were 'fallen people underserving of their land' and the Anglo- Saxons where 'chosen people' sent as a divine retribution to punish the Britons and to take their land. Essentially the 'Welsh' were demonised and 'othered' in order to justify treating them badly and taking their land, and to elevate the Saxons- '**

* **Briton language and culture was quickly replaced by Saxon language and culture in England.**
* **Surviving Briton people in England were slaves and were assimilated.**
* **Laws which valued Saxon/ English life more than a 'Welshman'.**
* **Negative stereotypes were rife in Anglo Saxon writing, Britons/ Welsh people frequently portrayed as 'dark' in contrast to the Saxons.**
* **Brittonic/ Welsh language portrayed as 'demonic,' 'gibberish'.**
* **'Welsh' went from meaning 'Romanised foreigner' to 'slave' and other uses such as 'inferior' (i.e 'Weala win' meaning inferior wine), 'strange', 'impudent', 'shameless'**
* [**Anglo-Saxonism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxonism_in_the_19th_century) **(a racial superiority belief system that began in the 19th century) was used by some as a way to** [**justify colonising other countries and the treatment of Native American people.**](https://www.academia.edu/85951970/William_Bradford_and_His_Anglo_Saxon_Influences)

**Summary of the attitudes of the Saxons/ English towards the native Britons/ Welsh. This is taken from an essay written by English historian Dr Debby Banham.**

>In Anglo-Saxon society, the killing of Britons was less harshly punished than killing Anglo-Saxons, the British had to live under English law, and British ethnic identity was identified with unfree social status, in a world where social inferiors were believed to be literally lower or worse people than their superiors. To summarise Anglo-Saxon attitudes to the British as represented by the documentary and linguistic evidence, it seems that Anglo-Saxon writers could make almost any derogatory generalisation about the Britons, represent them as objects rather than social agents, blame them for their own defeat, and depict their territory as up for grabs. Can Anglo-Saxon attitudes be described as racist?1

>They believed that one race, their own, was superior to another, the British. They were antagonistic, and their antagonism resulted in, or served to justify, the subordination of the British and their eventual absorption. I have no hesitation in identifying these attitudes as racist.1

>I see a continuity in English racism from the Anglo-Saxon landings, through the establishment of English hegemony, up to the present day. Belief in their own superiority has always served the English well in their expansionist aims. They did not need the Empire to make them racist.

**Brief history**

Briton tribes lived all over the British isle.

Before and during the Roman occupation, Britain was raided and invaded by several groups including the Irish and the Scots (the Scoti were a tribe from Ireland who colonised the north and created Scotland later on). It's even mentioned in the [Declaration of Arbroath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Arbroath) that the Scots had 'thrown out the *Britons* and completely destroyed the Picts '(Picts were a tribe living in north Britain).

After the Romans left Britain the island was left undefended and Scots invasions continued to get worse. The Romans had banned weapons so the Britons were not used to warfare.

The Saxons ended up in Britain, there are a few theories of how - one theory is that the Britons hired Saxon mercenaries (which was quite a common thing to do back then) to fight off the Scots invaders, but the Saxon mercenaries turned against the Britons and began raiding the island and encouraged others from the mainland to come to Britain.

Over time, Saxons, Angles (Angleland= England) and Jutes arrived in Britain and warred with the Britons with the intention of taking their land. And the Scots took land too- this is why there are so many Welsh sounding names in Scotland, Yr Hen Ogledd became part of Strathclyde

The Britons/ Welsh gradually lost more and more land and England was established, the land we now call 'Wales' is all they could keep hold of.

There has been a long debate about the fate of the native Britons, and [this archeology article](https://the-past.com/feature/the-migration-question-re-grounding-anglo-saxon-archaeology/) discusses the [2022 DNA study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05247-2) and what it likely means in terms of 'population replacement' of the native Britons. And would go to explain why Brittonic language and culture was replaced so quickly by Saxon culture. And why the Britons/ Welsh disappeared in England.

[The Anglo Saxon Chronicle](https://www.1066.co.nz/Mosaic%20DVD/library/cronicle/anglosaxon.htm) details the many of the wars between the Saxons and native Britons from the 5th century. And this a more [comprehensive list.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Anglo-Welsh_wars) It details the actions and attitudes of the Saxons towards the Britons- wars, 'taking towns and wealth', describing the Britons as 'worthless'.

**Attitudes of the Saxon settlers towards the native Britons.**

[Gildas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gildas) was a Romanised Briton monk who lived AD 450/500 – 570 and lived in Ystrad Clud, or where we now call Strathclyde. [He wrote about the events leading up to the Saxons coming to Britain.](https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/gildas_02_ruin_of_britain.htm)

[Bede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede) (AD 672/3 – 735) was an English monk and author and lived in where we would now call Tyne and Wear. He is seen as the 'Father of English history'.

He wrote extensively about the Saxons arrival in Britain [in the Ecclesiastical History of the English People.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_History_of_the_English_People) He also wrote a lot about the Briton people.

He is credited as creating a common identity for the English nation. He believed that the Saxons were justified in colonising Britain and replacing the native Briton population and saw the Saxons as divine retribution for the 'wickedness' of the Briton people.

>When the Anglo-Saxons arrived in what was to become England, they no more entered an empty wilderness than did the first Israelis in Palestine, or the first European settlers in America. [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/13507489508568093?needAccess=true&role=button)

>Bede is as far as we know the originator of this idea: he created a common identity for the Germanic settlers, and provided them with a history to be proud of.

>  
>But it is the British, with whom the English had most contact, who most consistently act as a foil for them, by lacking precisely those virtues the English are supposed to possess. Where the English are industrious and brave, they are lazy and cowardly; where the English are God-fearing and obedient  to Rome, the British, even when Christian, behave like pagans, and obstinately cling to their doctrinal independence. They are incapable of doing anything for themselves except fall into vice.[1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/13507489508568093?needAccess=true&role=button)

>  
>It was not only legitimate, but necessary to feel and to propagate hatred for the enemy.1

This is from the Anglo Saxon Chronicle

>They (the Saxons) described the worthlessness of the Britons, and the richness of the land.

And

>Bede suggests that the status of the English as a chosen people is conditional on the English staying faithful to God. He uses the example of the Britons' fall from grace into heresy to illustrate the penalty of breaking this (unwritten) covenant. Bede situates the chosen people in its very own promised land, an idealised Brittania overflowing with God's gifts. *The English initially arrive in Britain as an agent of divine retribution against the Britons, whom Bede represents as a fallen nation and a failed chosen people.* The English are represented as the Britons' successors, a 'foreknown' people. Their kings are represented as guardians of a covenant, responsible for protecting the people, not only from military threats but also from apostasy and spiritual decay. [2](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&u=googlescholar&id=GALE|A454359833&v=2.1&it=r&sid=googleScholar&asid=1c3caae0)  
>  
>Bede's representation of the English as a chosen people is clear from the very beginning of Historia ecclesiastica. Bede begins his history by establishing Brittania as an echo of the promised land of Canaan, and its original inhabitants, the Britons, as unworthy keepers of that land. Following the sixth-century British author Gildas, he represents the Britons as a chosen people gone astray, having fallen into heresy, lethargy and vice. He departs from Gildas by picturing the English not as a mindless barbarian horde, but as the successors to the British. [2](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&u=googlescholar&id=GALE|A454359833&v=2.1&it=r&sid=googleScholar&asid=1c3caae0)  
>  
>Gildas is often referred to as the British Jeremiah, a prophet crying out against the iniquities of his own people. For Gildas, the Britons failed to maintain their covenantal relationship with their creator, so the blessing of the 'promised land' is threatened with destruction.  
>  
>Bede takes up Gildas' criticism wholeheartedly. For Bede, the Britons were nothing less than rebels against God:  
>  
>*They cast off Christ's easy yoke and thrust their necks under the burden of drunkenness, hatred, quarrelling, strife, and envy ... \[They\] could not be awakened from the spiritual death which their sins had brought upon them.""*  
>  
>This judgement sets the stage for the arrival of the Saxons as retribution for the Britons' waywardness, ""ordained by the will of God so that evil might fall upon those miscreants."" [2](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&u=googlescholar&id=GALE|A454359833&v=2.1&it=r&sid=googleScholar&asid=1c3caae0)  
>  
>Bede saw the English as the new Chosen People. [8](https://www.academia.edu/85951970/William_Bradford_and_His_Anglo_Saxon_Influences)

Interestingly, Bede praised the Irish

>Bede represents the British as a failed nation; their punishment was to be overthrown and outshone by the invading English, and as Bede elucidates here, they continue (at the time of Historia ecclesiasticals completion) to dwell apart from the true church. The Irish, on the other hand, were chosen as one of the ""worthier heralds"" who would bring the gospel to the English, and as a result were forgiven for their heterodox ideas about Easter and the tonsure.[2](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&u=googlescholar&id=GALE|A454359833&v=2.1&it=r&sid=googleScholar&asid=1c3caae0)

**Villainising the Britons for defending themselves against Saxon colonisers**

>Cadwallon, king of Gwynedd is presented as little short of a monster. His resistance to Edwin of Northumbria, who had conquered his people, is represented as rebellion, and is described as 'more savage than a pagan', 'barbarous in temperament and behaviour'. 1  
>  
>The justification for this is that 'he (Cadwallon) was set upon wiping out the whole English people in Britain'.  If this were a true portrayal of Cadwallon's motivation and actions, it would hardly be surprising, but it reads more like a projection onto their victims of the English attitude to the Britons.1

**How the native Britons/ Welsh were portrayed in Anglo Saxon literature**

In Felix' Life of Guthlac, [St Guthlac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guthlac_of_Crowland) encounters demonic apparitions, and they are portrayed as 'speaking Brittonic' i.e the Welsh language.

>In this society, the assimilating Britons may well have been seen as ‘guests from elsewhere’ (while obviously indigenous) in the Anglo-Saxon households or communities that integrated them as people belonging to a different category – socially and ethnically, but also perhaps racially. Indeed, the Britons are treated as racial others in both Felix’s Vita Guthlaci and Guthlac A. [As Jeffrey Jerome Cohen argues](https://www.inthemedievalmiddle.com/2006/04/guthlac-mercia-and-anglo-saxon.html), ‘Guthlac’s colonization of the demons’ cherished home’ (the Fenlands, much like the home of the Grendelkin) not only ‘re-enacts in miniature the dispossession of that very territory’ by the Germanic tribes settling there in the fifth century. [3](https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/display/9781526136442/9781526136442.00018.xml)  
>  
>In a chapter entitled in the Old English translation ‘Hu þa deofla on brytisc spræcon’ (How the devils spoke in Brittonic), the Vita Guthlaci narrates that just as the Welsh are invading Mercia from the west during the reign of King Coenred, in the Fens a crowd of demons ‘impersonates a band of British marauders and sets fire to Guthlac’s dwelling, attacking him with spears’. Guthlac chants a psalm and the demon-Britons vanish ‘velut fumus’ (like smoke), potentially a symbolic parallel to the ‘powerful and attractive group fantasy’ of a Mercian ‘manifest destiny’ entitling it to conquer British lands while their inhabitants simply vanished.[3](https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/display/9781526136442/9781526136442.00018.xml)

And

>His settlement enacts a fantasy of [manifest destiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny), displacing the ethnic violence at Mercia's border to an internal space where a triumph can be spectacularly staged over external and internal difference simultaneously. Representing the Britons as banished demons and Guthlac as a man singularly in possession of himself offers a culturally useful fantasy of a male body whose identity is uncomplex, internally imperturbable. Guthlac's *stabilitas* \-- his immobile, granite-like, and unconflicted subjectivity -- embodies everything Anglo-Saxon England in general and eighth century Mercia in particular as potentially corporate identities were not. .[4](https://www.inthemedievalmiddle.com/2006/04/guthlac-mercia-and-anglo-saxon.html)

**How the Anglo Saxons racialised the native Britons in literature/ riddles as 'dark' and demonic and animalised**

>The Britons are clearly racialized in the Anglo-Saxon imaginary, belonging to a system of racial categorization in which several categories intersected: bodily distinction (Britons described repeatedly as *sweart* \[dark\]), language (Welsh as demonic speech in Guthlac or as incomprehensible gibberish in Ælfric\*), and social status (according to the *Laws* *of* *Ine* and the economic consequences thereof, also evident in the very term *wealh* and its entire lexical field of derogatory connotations). [3](https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/display/9781526136442/9781526136442.00018.xml)  
>  
>Nina Rulon-Miller brought to light the constellation in which the few Welsh personae to appear in the Exeter Book riddles are placed – it consists of oxen, the concepts of yoking or fettering, dark skin, and the borderland. For instance, in Riddle 72, an ox tended by a ‘sweart hyrde’ (dark herdsman) – compare the ‘sweart ond saloneb’ (black and dark-faced) servant in Riddle 49 – is ‘bunden under beam’ (bound under yoke) and treads the ‘mearcpaþas Walas’ (the paths on the Welsh march). In Riddle 12, swarthy Welsh men are tightly fettered with ox-leather bonds, and a dark Welsh woman works on an object made of ox-hide. RulonMiller proposes as the most likely solution to Riddle 52 ‘yoke of oxen led by a female slave’, since the riddle subjects are associated with binding as well as with a female Welsh slave or ‘Wale’. The association with oxen is thus quite transparent: both Britons and oxen are perceived in the riddles as servile creatures, physically or socially fettered, even if not all wealhas are slaves. But their description as ‘dark-skinned’, coupled with their association to animality, points to their essential otherness, with the potential of sliding into something that is so different to the ideal audience of the riddles as to be almost inhuman. [3](https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/display/9781526136442/9781526136442.00018.xml)  
>  
>By the time the Exeter Book riddles were inscribed in their extant forms, when the Welsh kingdoms no longer posed an immediate military threat and the Britons on Anglo-Saxon territories had been integrated as slaves, servants, or brides, this discourse could have developed nto a condescending (rather than outright monsterizing) linkage of the *wealhas* with animality, bondage, and dark skin. [3](https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/display/9781526136442/9781526136442.00018.xml)  
>  
>These  texts (*riddles that depict Britons as 'dark' and with negative traits etc*)  represent  mainstream  Anglo-Saxon thought. 1

\*(We see attitudes towards the Welsh language as being 'evil' in the Blue Books report- '*It is not easy to over-estimate it's evil effects. It is the language of the Cymri', an anterior to that of the ancient Britons.'* and '*It distorts the truth, favours fraud, and abets perjury')*

**Britons/ Welsh discriminated against in Anglo Saxon law**

In the Laws of Ine of Wessex (AD 694,)  in the [Wergild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weregild) system (monetary compensation for injuring or killing someone), 'Welshmen' were clearly defined as being 'lesser' in law, due to the wergild payment for an Anglo Saxon was 2 to 5 times higher than that of a 'Welshman'.

There are some theories on why this discrimination was made-

>The imbalance in wergelds between the two groups may hold within it the very key to the disappearance of the Britons. The wergeld provided the basic honour price for an individual and represented the compensation that would be paid to his kin on his death. Other legal compensations, for injury to self or property, however defined, were computed as a proportion of one’s wergeld. The long term effects of Britons being valued at about half the wergeld of their English counterparts was that, in the normal course of things, large amounts of property would gradually pass from the British community to the English. [5](https://www.academia.edu/313138/Apartheid_and_Economics_in_Anglo_Saxon_England)  
>  
>If, for example, a hypothetical English and British nobleman each owning five hides of land got into a series of disputes with one another and were dealt with fairly by the courts, sometimes giving judgement in favour of the one and sometimes of the other, then all compensations paid by the Briton to the Englishman would be twice the value of those paid to him by his opponent. The end result would be that the property and finally the land would pass to the Englishman. [5](https://www.academia.edu/313138/Apartheid_and_Economics_in_Anglo_Saxon_England)

And

>The early Anglo-Saxon laws give some indication of the circumstances under which the British lived in Anglo-Saxon society. The law-code of Ine of Wessex, originating in the late seventh century, but preserved as an appendix to the ninth-century Laws of Alfred, gives three levels of wergild (compensation for killing a family member) for free Welshmen,  all  lower than  the  wergild  of  a West  Saxon  peasant 1  
>  
>It has also been pointed out that differential scales of wergild were a common method of reinforcing the balance of power between conquered and conquering peoples throughout medieval Europe 1  
>  
>it would have been an important means of cultural assimilation: successful Britons 'became' English, while remaining British was a sign of failure to prosper.1

And

>The inferior social position of the free Wealh is further shown in Ine's Laws, where a man charged with stealing or harbouring stolen cattle had to produce an oath of sixty hides if he were accused by a Wealh, whereas if the accuser were English the oath required was doubled. 9

**The usage of 'Welsh' and derogatory associations**

'Welsh' originally meant 'Romanised foreigner'. But the meaning changed over time to mean 'slave' and other derogatory association.

Britons were often slaves in Anglo Saxon society to the point that 'Welsh' also meant 'slave'.

>The derogatory connotations attached to *wealh* or the adjective *wilisc* are plentifully attested, from ‘shameful person’ to ‘bad servant’, while Ælfric equates *weala win* with crudum uinum (rough, inferior wine) and has a sinner speak *wealode mid wordum* (‘strangely’, ‘impudently’). These associations survive in present-day British slang words such as ‘*to welsh*’ (to cheat) and ‘*welsher*’ (an untrustworthy person). As Ryan Craig and Victoria Davis demonstrate, such discursive practices are not divorced from material realities and are often used to reinforce and sustain material inequity by creating ‘a reality in which it is reasonable for a few to control and to possess the material at the sacrifice of the well-being of others’. [3](https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/display/9781526136442/9781526136442.00018.xml)

And

>That it has given us modern English 'Welsh' shows, however, that a parallel ethnic meaning continued in use. This dual meaning must have arisen in an intermediate period, in which 'Briton' and 'slave' were for practical purposes identical. [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/13507489508568093?needAccess=true&role=button)  
>  
>In the tenth century, the writer of the West Saxon gospels used *weala* to translate the Latin seruus in the parable of the good and evil servants.This seruus was not of British descent, so the Old English word must mean simply 'slave'.[1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/13507489508568093?needAccess=true&role=button)  
>  
>Between these two stages must have been a period when more or less all Britons were slaves. [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/13507489508568093?needAccess=true&role=button)

And

>The verbal and adjectival forms derived from *wealh* reveal further extensions of its meanings and connotations. AEfric uses the verb with the meaning ""*to be bold, impudent, wanton*"":  
>  
>""He cwae bat he nolde and wealode mid wordum ""  
>  
>He said that he would not and was insolent in his speech"". Clearly related to this meaning is' *walana.*' translating Aldhelm's protervorum ""*shameless people*"" in the Old English gloss of unknown date contained in a tenth-century manuscript, and wealh ""wanton"" in '*Ic eom ondetta 6aet ic onfeng on minne mud wealworda*' in a tenth-century fragment from a Latin liber poenitentialis. Finally, in the eleventh-century glossary which seems to have been compiled from a number of glossed manuscripts, the Latin barbarus, which has the sense ""foreign, uncultivated or ignorant"" and in the thirteenth century meant ""barbarian"", is glossed by *walch siue ungerad*. Ungerad usually has the sense ""rude, unskilled, foolish, ignorant"", so again the more negative aspects of *wealh* are stressed. [9](https://www.proquest.com/openview/6262f86f5209a64d88030ca2377bc617/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1817601)

And

>The derogatory connotations of *wealh* spill over onto its derivative fonns. In his sermon for Ash Wednesday, Aelfric uses the verb *wealian* to mean ""to be impudent, bold, or wanton"": *he cwatJ pat he no/de and wealode mid wordum, I and sade pat he wolde his wifes brucan I on pam unalyfedum timan* [10](https://dokumen.pub/beowulfs-wealhtheow-and-the-valkyrie-tradition.html)

**Analysing how Anglo Saxon texts contained ideas that normalised the justification for colonising other countries**

>The ideas that enable later colonial expansion are already present in Anglo-Saxon texts, in both the Anglo-Latin original and the Old English translation and adaptations.  
>  
>Post-colonial criticism attends to power relationships and knowledge imbalances between colonizers and colonized. Post-colonial theory usually focuses on modern empires, on colonies or former colonies, and their subjects, on the notion of the ‘other,’ on who speaks on whose behalf. But it can also help to understand what happened when Angles and Saxons invaded Britain in the years following the Roman withdrawal and supplanted the native Britons in positions of influence and power. The Lives of Guthlac present that overthrow, as well as the subsequent battles between the ‘englisc,’ and the Welsh and Britons who continued to occupy the margins of Britain in Wales in the west as well as in the fens in the east, as legitimate, and in fact as being in no need of any justification.   
>  
>Attending to the ways in which a text like the Life of Guthlac normalizes and naturalizes conquest and power imbalances illuminates the development of a world-view that enables later colonizing operations to be undertaken as if it were legitimate for the English to subdue the Irish and, later, the inhabitants of North America, China, India, and Africa. [6](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zkjxx3)  
>  
>There is abundant evidence in early English culture, in this case its literature, to show that the foundations of British racism, colonialism, and imperialism underpin Western approaches to both other humans *and* the environment. [7](https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/tmr/article/view/25925/31617)  
>  
>The way in which early Anglo-Saxon authors envisioned history can be viewed as an important ideological model for the later American concept of historical identity. It is only by looking closely at early nationalist movements—through the ecclesiastical and secular, the myths and histories, and the conflation of both—can the level of British, or English, influence on America’s myth of Anglo-Saxonism be properly understood.

Wales,comment,Occupation,jlt4h95,hellopo9,,"I think it's important to recognize that the Anglo-Saxon invasion and then migration were much more similar to the Spanish in Mexico than what happened to the USA. Despite significant mixing occurring, Mexican culture became overwhelmingly Spanish in language law, and art, similar to what happened to England. English people have significant Britonic ancestry and less than 50% Anglo-Saxon DNA (10-40% according to this study [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25788095/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25788095/)). English people I know naturally consider themselves directly descended from both the Celts and Saxons, in the same way, many Mexicans consider themselves descended from both the Native Americans and Spanish invaders.  While the 2022 paper you mentioned showed widespread replacement in the East of England (with the 10th-century burials in eastern England being 75% Germanic. The paper does also show that Britons and Saxons married and were buried next to each other along with their kids, so at that time most Saxons had one Celtic grandparent (75%). Research is unclear but there are also some indications that after the Norman invasion, many Celts moved back to the east and mixed in further.  Celtic lords in England married Saxons and vice versa shown by the name changes of their children (The line of the Celtic Cerdic of Wessex becoming anglicized for example). Looking back at what happened to the Brythonic culture it's awful how much was lost and horrific how many had to flee the raiders, but among the common Saxons and Bryonic celts mixing naturally occurred and people merged into one new people the English. I lived in Norfolk for a few years after I moved from Swansea and it was nice to see how people there revere Boudicca and how they keep those old cultural ties alive. All of this doesn't excuse Victorian (and modern) wankery to Wales from English aristocrats (and some of the general population) but we should recognize that the English do have Celtic elements from grammar, and place names to folk heroes and are proud to do so (increasing proud I personally find). I hope the English come to love their Celtic history more and in doing so love how Wales has preserved so many of the ancient traditions and language.",2023-05-27T10:48:31+00:00

- Trying to connect the relationship between Anglo-Saxons and Britons to the colonisation of Native Americans is beyond laughable.

- The arguments around the semantic development of the word ""wealh"" (meaning Welsh) make little sense. 

- No evidence to suggest Britons/the Welsh were slaves anymore than the Anglo-Saxons themselves.

- Ælfric describing Welsh wine as inferior does not mean the Welsh were seen as an inferior race. 

- OP claims a population replacement of Britons using a source that does not attest that.

- The apartheid theory is relatively old now, it's highly contested and isn't supported by archaeological evidence.

But beware! These policies aren't suitable to liberals or anyone leaning left on the political spectrum, so read at your own risk! You have been warned!


**The Economy**

* Replace VAT with a Local Sales Tax, set by the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties with freedom to vary the rate according to their spending needs

* Lower income and corporation taxes by 5% to allow subnational bodies to have their own local rates

* Decentralise the UK economy by moving civil service jobs out of London and encourage and set up new financial districts in Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Glasgow to with the goal for these cities to rival London

* Rename the Bank of England to the Bank of the United Kingdom (Bank UK)

* Replace English, Scottish, Northern Irish and UK territorial banknotes with a single UK currency banknote like we have with coins with its introduction set after the death of Queen Elizabeth II

* Reintroduce the £1 note into circulation

**Foreign Affairs and Defence**

* Support the existence of the Commonwealth of Nations, and will work for closer ties with the member states of the Commonwealth, while also being open to any application from countries who share the values of the Commonwealth for membership

* Work with international community to have a two-state solution to the Israel/Palestine and support Israel’s right to exist while refusing recognition of the Palestine state until they are fully democratic and committed to peaceful ways to resolving the conflict

* Recognise the Republic of Somaliland as a sovereign state and encourage the international community support its recognition

* Commit to spend 2% GDP on defence and increase annually by 0.5% provided GDP continues to rise

* Withdrawal from European Court of Human Rights

* Open internment camps in British Overseas Territories including a camp in the British Antarctic Territory for extraordinarily dangerous people operated by the military

* Seperate the Specialist Operations directorate from the London Metropolitan Police Service to its own agency H.M Specialist Operations (H.M.S.O) with responsibility for the protection of the Houses of Parliament, Downing Street, Whitehall, Buckingham Palace, the senior members of the British Royal Family, members of The Cabinet, other ministerial members of Her Majesty's Government and the Parliaments and administrations of the Home Nations, while moving responsibility of co-ordinating and leading on UK-wide national counter-terrorism matters to the National Crime Agency allowing the Met to focus on general policing in the Greater London region

* Give the citizens of Gibraltar and the Crown dependencies a referendum on becoming fully British, and having representation in the Houses of Parliament including their own MPs in the lower house and representation in the upper house

**International Trade**

* Support and negotiate the purposed CANZUK Group consisting of the Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom which sees cooperation between the four nations on free trade, foreign policy, constitutional affairs and freedom of movement

* Join EFTA, allowing us access to the four freedoms of the EU while allowing us the freedom to seek other trade deals with foreign countries, put in place restrictions on freedom of movement and if possible seek to negotiate further restrictions such as proof of proficiency in the English language

* Seek to join NAFTA, allowing us access to Canadian, American, Mexican markets once its future is secure and the CPTPP trade agreement, a signed, but not-yet ratified, trade agreement between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam giving us access to their markets once ratified

* Support and negotiate the creation of the Commonwealth Free Trade Association, which will massively boost trade between Commonwealth nations

* Recommission the Royal Yacht Britannia used to sign new trade deals and privately funded via donations at no tax payers expense

**Health**

* Set up a commission to look into reforming the NHS into a social insurance model of universal healthcare for citizens which subsidises most healthcare costs as opposed to an outdated health service with different NHS plans available for citizens as well as specific plans for children, students, the disabled and the retired

* Introduce a flat NHS levy of 2% of income for additional funding of the NHS with opt outs available for individuals who use private insurance

* Encourage strong competition in free market healthcare to drive up standards and encourage more Britons to opt for private health insurance

* No NHS funding for abortions unless a victim of rape, the baby is life threatening to the mother or foetal abnormalities. Illegal after 24 weeks unless life threatening, or foetal abnormalities occur

* Allow foreign nationals with legal rights to work in the UK to have full access to NHS treatment provided they pay the 2% NHS levy

**Education**

* Introduce a Tuition Fee Equality bill to have UK universities charge all UK students the same rate for tuition fees as a resident of any other EU country, regardless of which part of the UK they are from

* Replace tuition fees with a flat graduate tax.

Wales,comment,Israel-Palestine War/War,e38w9w6,,,"Man, the effort to respond to all of this would be far too much for a Sunday. Whilst there are good policies in here, there's also a lot of polices which seem pretty nutty to me. In particular, social policies, the support for privatisation, and the disregard for human rights internationally.

For instance:

>Require all school pupils to pledge allegiance to Queen and Country at the start of school: “I pledge allegiance to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I will respect our rights and freedoms. I will uphold our democratic values. I will observe our laws faithfully and fulfil my duties as a British citizen, for Queen and Country. So help me God.” The home nations can also have their own respective pledge of allegiances, for example in Texas were pupils pledge allegiance to the US and to the state of Texas

Why? Not only would this not achieve anything(kids would find it a waste of time), but attempting to instil an uncritical devotion to the country is daft. People shouldn't observe the laws of the UK if the laws are unjust, and shouldn't have to ""fulfil their duties""(Whatever that means), if the duties involve acting injustly.

What's more, the references to the Queen and God are a bit strange. A lot of the country are republicans, and even more don't believe in God, so it really fails at representing the majority of the population(certainly the majority of the population who attend school).",2018-07-29T17:53:48+00:00

- I don’t like VAT, but okay
- Income yes, corporation no
- All for decentralisation
- Definitely
- Why?
- I don’t see the need and I’m pretty sure it’s more costly

**Foreign Affairs and Defence**
- The Commonwealth is for countries with ties to the UK by being former colonies, not the new British Empire
- Yes
- Not sure
- Development aid is more important than wars
- Only European country along with Belarus not part of the ECHR?
- Fuck no
- No opinion
- Definitely

**International Trade**
- Fine
- Stay in the EU. Why not proficiency in Welsh areas as well? Not that I support either.
- **North American* Free Trade Area. Why not join that massive trade bloc that you are a lot more connected with?
- Don’t care about the Commonwealth, but it seems like you just want the British Empire back
-I guess?

**Health**
- No, single-payer
- Nope
- One word. America
- The government can afford the hundreds of thousands that child would cost, but not an abortion? This just punishes poor women who are often those in most need of an abortion.
- Yes, but I feel like there’s some catch

**Education**
- That is fair
- Just have it from general taxation
- I’d like grants for all and a very affordable loan system like in Sweden
- I don’t know enough
- Definitely. It seems like such a mess now
- I don’t see a problem
- I hate the obsession with Mandarin. For the vast majority of people, it will never be useful and a traditional European one would be much better. I would like to see however everyone studying a native Celtic language. This is an idea often suggested in Spain to increase national unity
- Yes
- No. That won’t do anything. Would teaching them something a bit more useful and important than how to kill someone not be better?
- God no
- No, race to the bottom
- That sounds good as long as it includes all of the ugly stuff of the British Empire which you sort of seem to be including with the Scottish and Irish history parts.
- Definitely
- NO.
- FUCK NO.

**Immigration**
- Not against it, but why are they okay and not your European neighbours?
- No
- I think you have to do this in a lot of countries, so I guess that’s fine
- Don’t know
- Why are they okay?
- I think so. Canada does it
- I don’t know enough about it
- You do realise that a lot of people go to an English-speaking country to learn English?
- Yes
- No
- No
- No

**Media**

- For God’s sake
- Nope
- I guess so
- Okay
- Again one word. America
- I think so

**Culture**

- No, decrease it
- Yes
- Why?
- Don’t know
- Do these actually exist?
- Not sure
- Maybe
- Have them as public holidays in all parts of the UK
- Too many bank holidays
- I think that’s a good idea

**Sport**
- Sure
- Why not

**Constitutional Affairs**
- I definitely support a written constitution
- Yes
- Yes
- No. AV is practically just as bad as FPTP. Have either STV or a list system
- Too small
- STV everywhere
- I don’t know about them
- I think that could lead to something like Italy where nothing happens
- Not really needed in STV
- Maybe
- I’ve always liked the ideas of that, but it’s not done anywhere apart from America, I think

- Yes
- I think so

**Law and Order**
- I’m open to the idea
- I don’t understand
- Sentencing based on the crime just doesn’t make sense. Somebody should be in prison for as long as is needed to rehabilitate them, not to punish them
- Maybe
- Base it on a regional level
- Yes
- No opinion
- No. Want to be the second Western democracy to have one of the greatest human rights violations?
- No. The longest sentence should be 21 years, except when they pose a very clear threat to society obviously. That’s what it is in Norway and they have the lowest recidivism rates in the world
- That’s just stupid. What good does it do? Remove them from their family and friends and force them back into crime? Besides how would you enforce it?
- No long sentences
- No life sentences
- Yeah, cause the tough approach always works out
- Unarmed police work great
- I guess so
- A cultural change is more important than locking people up. Not that we shouldn’t do that

Tories because it undermines ""Britain"" and Labour because it makes Immigrants feel unwelcome.   


However, since Brexit; and to a lesser extent the Scottish independence vote; the UK government has been actively pursuing a ""British"" first idea. It's core goals being the erosion of national pride of the home nations in favour of a British national pride ( trade one nationalism for another ).

Yeah, like that will be popular in Wales, where they barely teach our history... you want instead to indoctrinate our kids to see the ""Glory of England""?

Wales,comment,Israel-Palestine Conflict/Conflict,e38w9w6,,,"Man, the effort to respond to all of this would be far too much for a Sunday. Whilst there are good policies in here, there's also a lot of polices which seem pretty nutty to me. In particular, social policies, the support for privatisation, and the disregard for human rights internationally.

For instance:

>Require all school pupils to pledge allegiance to Queen and Country at the start of school: “I pledge allegiance to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I will respect our rights and freedoms. I will uphold our democratic values. I will observe our laws faithfully and fulfil my duties as a British citizen, for Queen and Country. So help me God.” The home nations can also have their own respective pledge of allegiances, for example in Texas were pupils pledge allegiance to the US and to the state of Texas

Why? Not only would this not achieve anything(kids would find it a waste of time), but attempting to instil an uncritical devotion to the country is daft. People shouldn't observe the laws of the UK if the laws are unjust, and shouldn't have to ""fulfil their duties""(Whatever that means), if the duties involve acting injustly.

What's more, the references to the Queen and God are a bit strange. A lot of the country are republicans, and even more don't believe in God, so it really fails at representing the majority of the population(certainly the majority of the population who attend school).",2018-07-29T17:53:48+00:00

- I don’t like VAT, but okay
- Income yes, corporation no
- All for decentralisation
- Definitely
- Why?
- I don’t see the need and I’m pretty sure it’s more costly

**Foreign Affairs and Defence**
- The Commonwealth is for countries with ties to the UK by being former colonies, not the new British Empire
- Yes
- Not sure
- Development aid is more important than wars
- Only European country along with Belarus not part of the ECHR?
- Fuck no
- No opinion
- Definitely

**International Trade**
- Fine
- Stay in the EU. Why not proficiency in Welsh areas as well? Not that I support either.
- **North American* Free Trade Area. Why not join that massive trade bloc that you are a lot more connected with?
- Don’t care about the Commonwealth, but it seems like you just want the British Empire back
-I guess?

**Health**
- No, single-payer
- Nope
- One word. America
- The government can afford the hundreds of thousands that child would cost, but not an abortion? This just punishes poor women who are often those in most need of an abortion.
- Yes, but I feel like there’s some catch

**Education**
- That is fair
- Just have it from general taxation
- I’d like grants for all and a very affordable loan system like in Sweden
- I don’t know enough
- Definitely. It seems like such a mess now
- I don’t see a problem
- I hate the obsession with Mandarin. For the vast majority of people, it will never be useful and a traditional European one would be much better. I would like to see however everyone studying a native Celtic language. This is an idea often suggested in Spain to increase national unity
- Yes
- No. That won’t do anything. Would teaching them something a bit more useful and important than how to kill someone not be better?
- God no
- No, race to the bottom
- That sounds good as long as it includes all of the ugly stuff of the British Empire which you sort of seem to be including with the Scottish and Irish history parts.
- Definitely
- NO.
- FUCK NO.

**Immigration**
- Not against it, but why are they okay and not your European neighbours?
- No
- I think you have to do this in a lot of countries, so I guess that’s fine
- Don’t know
- Why are they okay?
- I think so. Canada does it
- I don’t know enough about it
- You do realise that a lot of people go to an English-speaking country to learn English?
- Yes
- No
- No
- No

**Media**
- I’d like it increased
- For God’s sake
- Nope
- I guess so
- Okay
- Again one word. America
- I think so

**Culture**
- I want smoking banned in public areas. That means outdoors as well. There should be specific areas they have to go to where all non-smokers can easily avoid not being forced to breathe in their smoke
- No, decrease it
- Yes
- Why?
- Don’t know
- Do these actually exist?
- Not sure
- Maybe
- Have them as public holidays in all parts of the UK
- Too many bank holidays
- I think that’s a good idea

**Sport**
- Sure
- Why not

**Constitutional Affairs**
- I definitely support a written constitution
- Yes
- Yes
- No. AV is practically just as bad as FPTP. Have either STV or a list system
- Too small
- STV everywhere
- I don’t know about them

- Not really needed in STV
- Maybe
- I’ve always liked the ideas of that, but it’s not done anywhere apart from America, I think

**Welfare**
- No
- Yes
- No
- Not sure
- Yes
- I think I support that
- No. If you’re paying into the system, you should get the benefits

**The Monarchy**

- Yes
- Yes
- Yes
- Yes

**England and Local Government**
- No. About nine regions with similar powers to the Welsh Assembly
- I’d prefer for the counties to be made into something smaller and for all of them to have directly-elected mayors
- Yes
- I think so

**Law and Order**
- I’m open to the idea
- I don’t understand
- Sentencing based on the crime just doesn’t make sense. Somebody should be in prison for as long as is needed to rehabilitate them, not to punish them
- Maybe
- Base it on a regional level
- Yes
- No opinion
- No. Want to be the second Western democracy to have one of the greatest human rights violations?
- No. The longest sentence should be 21 years, except when they pose a very clear threat to society obviously. That’s what it is in Norway and they have the lowest recidivism rates in the world
- That’s just stupid. What good does it do? Remove them from their family and friends and force them back into crime? Besides how would you enforce it?
- No long sentences
- No life sentences
- Yeah, cause the tough approach always works out
- Unarmed police work great
- I guess so
- A cultural change is more important than locking people up. Not that we shouldn’t do that

Wales,post,Israel Defense Forces,5pk9in,walesfirstforonce,Battle of Heavenfield,"I know this isn't the history sub but its time we took history to the people as they dont seem to be going to it.

So i hope i can post some stuff about significant events in welsh history (mostly battles)  now and then in the hope someone becomes as addicted as me :) 

Welsh history shaped the wales we know and love today and i believe it is as relevant to this sub as most of the other posts we see. 

If i'm allowed that is. 

Battle of Heavenfield

where the scots help defeat the welsh. 
The Battle of Heavenfield was fought in 633 or 634 between a Northumbrian army under Oswald of Bernicia and a Welsh army under Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd. 

The battle resulted in a decisive Northumbrian victory. The Annales Cambriae (Annals of Wales) record the battle as Bellum Cantscaul in 631. Bede referred to it as the Battle of Deniseburna near Hefenfelth.

An alliance between Cadwallon of Gwynedd and King Penda of Mercia had led to an invasion of Northumbria. This was an odd alliance between a Christian king of Brythonic descent and a pagan king of Anglian descent. At the Battle of Hatfield Chase on 12 October 633, the invading Welsh and Mercians had killed Northumbrian king Edwin and Northumbria was split between its two sub-kingdoms, Bernicia and Deira. Cadwallon's army laid waste to Northumbria.

Eanfrith, who had been exiled under Edwin, became king of Bernicia, whilst Deira was ruled by Osric, a cousin of Edwin. Eanfrith's reign was short, as he was killed by Cadwallon whilst trying to negotiate peace.[citation needed] According to Bede, Osric was killed by Cadwallon whilst trying to besiege him. Eanfrith's brother, Oswald, then returned from seventeen years exile in Dál Riata to claim the crown of Northumbria. However the threat of Cadwallon lingered and Oswald had to raise an army as soon as possible to deal with his invading force.


It seems that the Welsh army advanced northward from York along the line of Dere Street. Oswald, who may have been accompanied by a force of Scots, took up a defensive position beside the Roman Wall, about 6 km (4 mi) north of Hexham. It was claimed that the night before the battle, Oswald had a vision of Saint Columba, in which the saint foretold that Oswald would be victorious. Oswald placed his army so that it was facing east, with its flanks shielded by Brady's Crag to the north and the Wall to the south. According to Bede, Oswald raised a cross, and prayed for victory alongside his troops.
It is believed that the Welsh had greater numbers, but they were forced to attack from the east along a narrow front, where they were hemmed in and unable to outflank the Northumbrians. It is not known how long the battle lasted or what the losses were, but the Welsh line finally broke. This began a headlong flight southward by the Welsh, pursued by the vengeful Northumbrians. Many Welsh soldiers were cut down as they ran, and according to Bede, Cadwallon was caught and killed at a place called the 'Brook of Denis', now identified as the Rowley Burn. The battle was a decisive victory for Oswald, and it was likely that the Welsh losses must have been substantial. Afterwards, the site was known as Heavenfield (Hefenfelth).
After the battle, Oswald re-united Deira with Bernicia and became king of all Northumbria. Bede believed that the importance of the battle was that it restored Christianity to Northumbria. Oswald was only to spend eight years upon the Northumbrian throne before he was defeated and killed by King Penda of Mercia at the Battle of Maserfield, in Shropshire. Oswald was succeeded as king of Northumbria by his brother Oswiu.",2017-01-22T22:37:35+00:00

Wales,comment,Israel Defense Forces,dcryiha,KaiserMacCleg,,"It's also Oswald of Northumbria who gave his name to Oswesty / Croesoswallt. A few years following Heavenfield, Oswald was on the offensive, campaigning against Penda and allies, the men of Powys. Oswald's army was routed and he himself killed at the Battle of Maserfield, near modern-day Oswestry, which was a part of Powys at the time.

The story goes that following his death a raven took his right arm to an ash tree, which was thereafter imbued with miraculous properties. Hence Oswald's Tree = Oswestry.",2017-01-23T00:55:04+00:00

Wales,comment,Israel Defense Forces,e38w9w6,,,"Man, the effort to respond to all of this would be far too much for a Sunday. Whilst there are good policies in here, there's also a lot of polices which seem pretty nutty to me. In particular, social policies, the support for privatisation, and the disregard for human rights internationally.

For instance:

>Require all school pupils to pledge allegiance to Queen and Country at the start of school: “I pledge allegiance to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I will respect our rights and freedoms. I will uphold our democratic values. I will observe our laws faithfully and fulfil my duties as a British citizen, for Queen and Country. So help me God.” The home nations can also have their own respective pledge of allegiances, for example in Texas were pupils pledge allegiance to the US and to the state of Texas

Why? Not only would this not achieve anything(kids would find it a waste of time), but attempting to instil an uncritical devotion to the country is daft. People shouldn't observe the laws of the UK if the laws are unjust, and shouldn't have to ""fulfil their duties""(Whatever that means), if the duties involve acting injustly.

What's more, the references to the Queen and God are a bit strange. A lot of the country are republicans, and even more don't believe in God, so it really fails at representing the majority of the population(certainly the majority of the population who attend school).",2018-07-29T17:53:48+00:00

- I don’t like VAT, but okay
- Income yes, corporation no
- All for decentralisation
- Definitely
- Why?
- I don’t see the need and I’m pretty sure it’s more costly

**Foreign Affairs and Defence**
- The Commonwealth is for countries with ties to the UK by being former colonies, not the new British Empire
- Yes
- Not sure
- Development aid is more important than wars
- Only European country along with Belarus not part of the ECHR?
- Fuck no
- No opinion
- Definitely

**International Trade**
- Fine
- Stay in the EU. Why not proficiency in Welsh areas as well? Not that I support either.
- **North American* Free Trade Area. Why not join that massive trade bloc that you are a lot more connected with?
- Don’t care about the Commonwealth, but it seems like you just want the British Empire back
-I guess?

**Health**
- No, single-payer
- Nope
- One word. America
- The government can afford the hundreds of thousands that child would cost, but not an abortion? This just punishes poor women who are often those in most need of an abortion.
- Yes, but I feel like there’s some catch

**Education**
- That is fair
- Just have it from general taxation
- I’d like grants for all and a very affordable loan system like in Sweden
- I don’t know enough
- Definitely. It seems like such a mess now
- I don’t see a problem
- I hate the obsession with Mandarin. For the vast majority of people, it will never be useful and a traditional European one would be much better. I would like to see however everyone studying a native Celtic language. This is an idea often suggested in Spain to increase national unity
- Yes
- No. That won’t do anything. Would teaching them something a bit more useful and important than how to kill someone not be better?
- God no
- No, race to the bottom
- That sounds good as long as it includes all of the ugly stuff of the British Empire which you sort of seem to be including with the Scottish and Irish history parts.
- Definitely
- NO.
- FUCK NO.

**Immigration**
- Not against it, but why are they okay and not your European neighbours?
- No

Wales,post,Palestine Liberation Organization,13sus3z,leopardprintcactus,The cause and origins of anti-Welsh prejudice in early England and how this manifested in society.,"I found some really interesting and informative articles written by historians about the cause of anti- Welsh prejudice in early Saxon England. If you don't want to read the whole post, there's a TLDR and a quote summary.

I've quoted from the various articles and essays and linked the full articles at the end.

*(As you are probably aware 'Welsh' is the name given by the Saxons to native Britons. The terms 'native Briton' and 'Britons' and 'Welsh' are used interchangeably in the articles, but mean the same thing. The Norman invasion worsened prejudice against the Welsh living in Wales, but their prejudice against the Welsh was rooted in a different motivation.*)

This refers to the era from when the Saxons first came to Britain and Britons/ Welsh lived in English society up until the 10th century, after which 'Welsh' people were no longer recognised as a separate group in England.

**TLDR:**

* **Anti- Briton/ Welsh prejudice in this era was caused by a belief system that justified the Saxons colonising and replacing the Briton/ Welsh population during the 5th century. It included religious elements such as believing the Britons were 'fallen people underserving of their land' and the Anglo- Saxons where 'chosen people' sent as a divine retribution to punish the Britons and to take their land. Essentially the 'Welsh' were demonised and 'othered' in order to justify treating them badly and taking their land, and to elevate the Saxons- '**

>the British (Welsh) needed to be very evil, perpetrators of terrible sins and devoid of moral scruple, for the English treatment of them to be unproblematic' [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/13507489508568093?needAccess=true&role=button)

* **Briton language and culture was quickly replaced by Saxon language and culture in England.**
* **Surviving Briton people in England were slaves and were assimilated.**
* **Laws which valued Saxon/ English life more than a 'Welshman'.**
* **Negative stereotypes were rife in Anglo Saxon writing, Britons/ Welsh people frequently portrayed as 'dark' in contrast to the Saxons.**
* **Brittonic/ Welsh language portrayed as 'demonic,' 'gibberish'.**
* **'Welsh' went from meaning 'Romanised foreigner' to 'slave' and other uses such as 'inferior' (i.e 'Weala win' meaning inferior wine), 'strange', 'impudent', 'shameless'**
* [**Anglo-Saxonism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxonism_in_the_19th_century) **(a racial superiority belief system that began in the 19th century) was used by some as a way to** [**justify colonising other countries and the treatment of Native American people.**](https://www.academia.edu/85951970/William_Bradford_and_His_Anglo_Saxon_Influences)

**Summary of the attitudes of the Saxons/ English towards the native Britons/ Welsh. This is taken from an essay written by English historian Dr Debby Banham.**

>In Anglo-Saxon society, the killing of Britons was less harshly punished than killing Anglo-Saxons, the British had to live under English law, and British ethnic identity was identified with unfree social status, in a world where social inferiors were believed to be literally lower or worse people than their superiors. To summarise Anglo-Saxon attitudes to the British as represented by the documentary and linguistic evidence, it seems that Anglo-Saxon writers could make almost any derogatory generalisation about the Britons, represent them as objects rather than social agents, blame them for their own defeat, and depict their territory as up for grabs. Can Anglo-Saxon attitudes be described as racist?1  
>  
>They believed that one race, their own, was superior to another, the British. They were antagonistic, and their antagonism resulted in, or served to justify, the subordination of the British and their eventual absorption. I have no hesitation in identifying these attitudes as racist.1  
>  
>I see a continuity in English racism from the Anglo-Saxon landings, through the establishment of English hegemony, up to the present day. Belief in their own superiority has always served the English well in their expansionist aims. They did not need the Empire to make them racist. They could manage it quite well when they had only the British to practise on.1

**Brief history**

Briton tribes lived all over the British isle.

Before and during the Roman occupation, Britain was raided and invaded by several groups including the Irish and the Scots (the Scoti were a tribe from Ireland who colonised the north and created Scotland later on). It's even mentioned in the [Declaration of Arbroath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Arbroath) that the Scots had 'thrown out the *Britons* and completely destroyed the Picts '(Picts were a tribe living in north Britain).

After the Romans left Britain the island was left undefended and Scots invasions continued to get worse. The Romans had banned weapons so the Britons were not used to warfare.

The Saxons ended up in Britain, there are a few theories of how - one theory is that the Britons hired Saxon mercenaries (which was quite a common thing to do back then) to fight off the Scots invaders, but the Saxon mercenaries turned against the Britons and began raiding the island and encouraged others from the mainland to come to Britain.

Over time, Saxons, Angles (Angleland= England) and Jutes arrived in Britain and warred with the Britons with the intention of taking their land. And the Scots took land too- this is why there are so many Welsh sounding names in Scotland, Yr Hen Ogledd became part of Strathclyde

The Britons/ Welsh gradually lost more and more land and England was established, the land we now call 'Wales' is all they could keep hold of.

There has been a long debate about the fate of the native Britons, and [this archeology article](https://the-past.com/feature/the-migration-question-re-grounding-anglo-saxon-archaeology/) discusses the [2022 DNA study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05247-2) and what it likely means in terms of 'population replacement' of the native Britons. And would go to explain why Brittonic language and culture was replaced so quickly by Saxon culture. And why the Britons/ Welsh disappeared in England.

[The Anglo Saxon Chronicle](https://www.1066.co.nz/Mosaic%20DVD/library/cronicle/anglosaxon.htm) details the many of the wars between the Saxons and native Britons from the 5th century. And this a more [comprehensive list.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Anglo-Welsh_wars) It details the actions and attitudes of the Saxons towards the Britons- wars, 'taking towns and wealth', describing the Britons as 'worthless'.

**Attitudes of the Saxon settlers towards the native Britons.**

[Gildas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gildas) was a Romanised Briton monk who lived AD 450/500 – 570 and lived in Ystrad Clud, or where we now call Strathclyde. [He wrote about the events leading up to the Saxons coming to Britain.](https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/gildas_02_ruin_of_britain.htm)

[Bede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede) (AD 672/3 – 735) was an English monk and author and lived in where we would now call Tyne and Wear. He is seen as the 'Father of English history'.

He wrote extensively about the Saxons arrival in Britain [in the Ecclesiastical History of the English People.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_History_of_the_English_People) He also wrote a lot about the Briton people.

He is credited as creating a common identity for the English nation. He believed that the Saxons were justified in colonising Britain and replacing the native Briton population and saw the Saxons as divine retribution for the 'wickedness' of the Briton people.

>But it is the British, with whom the English had most contact, who most consistently act as a foil for them, by lacking precisely those virtues the English are supposed to possess.

They are incapable of doing anything for themselves except fall into vice.[1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/13507489508568093?needAccess=true&role=button)

This is from the Anglo Saxon Chronicle

>They (the Saxons) described the worthlessness of the Britons, and the richness of the land.

And

>Bede suggests that the status of the English as a chosen people is conditional on the English staying faithful to God. He uses the example of the Britons' fall from grace into heresy to illustrate the penalty of breaking this (unwritten) covenant. Bede situates the chosen people in its very own promised land, an idealised Brittania overflowing with God's gifts. *The English initially arrive in Britain as an agent of divine retribution against the Britons, whom Bede represents as a fallen nation and a failed chosen people.* The English are represented as the Britons' successors, a 'foreknown' people. Their kings are represented as guardians of a covenant, responsible for protecting the people, not only from military threats but also from apostasy and spiritual decay. [2](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&u=googlescholar&id=GALE|A454359833&v=2.1&it=r&sid=googleScholar&asid=1c3caae0)  
>  
>Bede's representation of the English as a chosen people is clear from the very beginning of Historia ecclesiastica. Bede begins his history by establishing Brittania as an echo of the promised land of Canaan, and its original inhabitants, the Britons, as unworthy keepers of that land. Following the sixth-century British author Gildas, he represents the Britons as a chosen people gone astray, having fallen into heresy, lethargy and vice. He departs from Gildas by picturing the English not as a mindless barbarian horde, but as the successors to the British. [2](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&u=googlescholar&id=GALE|A454359833&v=2.1&it=r&sid=googleScholar&asid=1c3caae0)  
>  
>Gildas is often referred to as the British Jeremiah, a prophet crying out against the iniquities of his own people. For Gildas, the Britons failed to maintain their covenantal relationship with their creator, so the blessing of the 'promised land' is threatened with destruction.  
>  
>Bede takes up Gildas' criticism wholeheartedly. For Bede, the Britons were nothing less than rebels against God:  
>  
>*They cast off Christ's easy yoke and thrust their necks under the burden of drunkenness, hatred, quarrelling, strife, and envy ... \[They\] could not be awakened from the spiritual death which their sins had brought upon them.""*  
>  
>This judgement sets the stage for the arrival of the Saxons as retribution for the Britons' waywardness, ""ordained by the will of God so that evil might fall upon those miscreants."" [2](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&u=googlescholar&id=GALE|A454359833&v=2.1&it=r&sid=googleScholar&asid=1c3caae0)  
>  
>Bede saw the English as the new Chosen People. [8](https://www.academia.edu/85951970/William_Bradford_and_His_Anglo_Saxon_Influences)

Interestingly, Bede praised the Irish

>Bede represents the British as a failed nation; their punishment was to be overthrown and outshone by the invading English, and as Bede elucidates here, they continue (at the time of Historia ecclesiasticals completion) to dwell apart from the true church. The Irish, on the other hand, were chosen as one of the ""worthier heralds"" who would bring the gospel to the English, and as a result were forgiven for their heterodox ideas about Easter and the tonsure.[2](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&u=googlescholar&id=GALE|A454359833&v=2.1&it=r&sid=googleScholar&asid=1c3caae0)

**Villainising the Britons for defending themselves against Saxon colonisers**

>Cadwallon, king of Gwynedd is presented as little short of a monster. His resistance to Edwin of Northumbria, who had conquered his people, is represented as rebellion, and is described as 'more savage than a pagan', 'barbarous in temperament and behaviour'. 1  
>  
>The justification for this is that 'he (Cadwallon) was set upon wiping out the whole English people in Britain'.  If this were a true portrayal of Cadwallon's motivation and actions, it would hardly be surprising, but it reads more like a projection onto their victims of the English attitude to the Britons.1

**How the native Britons/ Welsh were portrayed in Anglo Saxon literature**

In Felix' Life of Guthlac, [St Guthlac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guthlac_of_Crowland) encounters demonic apparitions, and they are portrayed as 'speaking Brittonic' i.e the Welsh language.

>In this society, the assimilating Britons may well have been seen as ‘guests from elsewhere’ (while obviously indigenous) in the Anglo-Saxon households or communities that integrated them as people belonging to a different category – socially and ethnically, but also perhaps racially. Indeed, the Britons are treated as racial others in both Felix’s Vita Guthlaci and Guthlac A. [As Jeffrey Jerome Cohen argues](https://www.inthemedievalmiddle.com/2006/04/guthlac-mercia-and-anglo-saxon.html), ‘Guthlac’s colonization of the demons’ cherished home’ (the Fenlands, much like the home of the Grendelkin) not only ‘re-enacts in miniature the dispossession of that very territory’ by the Germanic tribes settling there in the fifth century. [3](https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/display/9781526136442/9781526136442.00018.xml)  
>  
>In a chapter entitled in the Old English translation ‘Hu þa deofla on brytisc spræcon’ (How the devils spoke in Brittonic), the Vita Guthlaci narrates that just as the Welsh are invading Mercia from the west during the reign of King Coenred, in the Fens a crowd of demons ‘impersonates a band of British marauders and sets fire to Guthlac’s dwelling, attacking him with spears’. Guthlac chants a psalm and the demon-Britons vanish ‘velut fumus’ (like smoke), potentially a symbolic parallel to the ‘powerful and attractive group fantasy’ of a Mercian ‘manifest destiny’ entitling it to conquer British lands while their inhabitants simply vanished.[3](https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/display/9781526136442/9781526136442.00018.xml)

And

>His settlement enacts a fantasy of [manifest destiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny), displacing the ethnic violence at Mercia's border to an internal space where a triumph can be spectacularly staged over external and internal difference simultaneously. Representing the Britons as banished demons and Guthlac as a man singularly in possession of himself offers a culturally useful fantasy of a male body whose identity is uncomplex, internally imperturbable. Guthlac's *stabilitas* \-- his immobile, granite-like, and unconflicted subjectivity -- embodies everything Anglo-Saxon England in general and eighth century Mercia in particular as potentially corporate identities were not. .[4](https://www.inthemedievalmiddle.com/2006/04/guthlac-mercia-and-anglo-saxon.html)

**How the Anglo Saxons racialised the native Britons in literature/ riddles as 'dark' and demonic and animalised**

>The Britons are clearly racialized in the Anglo-Saxon imaginary, belonging to a system of racial categorization in which several categories intersected: bodily distinction (Britons described repeatedly as *sweart* \[dark\]), language (Welsh as demonic speech in Guthlac or as incomprehensible gibberish in Ælfric\*), and social status (according to the *Laws* *of* *Ine* and the economic consequences thereof, also evident in the very term *wealh* and its entire lexical field of derogatory connotations). [3](https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/display/9781526136442/9781526136442.00018.xml)  
>  
>Nina Rulon-Miller brought to light the constellation in which the few Welsh personae to appear in the Exeter Book riddles are placed – it consists of oxen, the concepts of yoking or fettering, dark skin, and the borderland. For instance, in Riddle 72, an ox tended by a ‘sweart hyrde’ (dark herdsman) – compare the ‘sweart ond saloneb’ (black and dark-faced) servant in Riddle 49 – is ‘bunden under beam’ (bound under yoke) and treads the ‘mearcpaþas Walas’ (the paths on the Welsh march). In Riddle 12, swarthy Welsh men are tightly fettered with ox-leather bonds, and a dark Welsh woman works on an object made of ox-hide. RulonMiller proposes as the most likely solution to Riddle 52 ‘yoke of oxen led by a female slave’, since the riddle subjects are associated with binding as well as with a female Welsh slave or ‘Wale’. The association with oxen is thus quite transparent: both Britons and oxen are perceived in the riddles as servile creatures, physically or socially fettered, even if not all wealhas are slaves. But their description as ‘dark-skinned’, coupled with their association to animality, points to their essential otherness, with the potential of sliding into something that is so different to the ideal audience of the riddles as to be almost inhuman. [3](https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/display/9781526136442/9781526136442.00018.xml)  
>  
>By the time the Exeter Book riddles were inscribed in their extant forms, when the Welsh kingdoms no longer posed an immediate military threat and the Britons on Anglo-Saxon territories had been integrated as slaves, servants, or brides, this discourse could have developed nto a condescending (rather than outright monsterizing) linkage of the *wealhas* with animality, bondage, and dark skin. [3](https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/display/9781526136442/9781526136442.00018.xml)  
>  
>These  texts (*riddles that depict Britons as 'dark' and with negative traits etc*)  represent  mainstream  Anglo-Saxon thought. 1

\*(We see attitudes towards the Welsh language as being 'evil' in the Blue Books report- '*It is not easy to over-estimate it's evil effects. It is the language of the Cymri', an anterior to that of the ancient Britons.'* and '*It distorts the truth, favours fraud, and abets perjury')*

**Britons/ Welsh discriminated against in Anglo Saxon law**

In the Laws of Ine of Wessex (AD 694,)  in the [Wergild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weregild) system (monetary compensation for injuring or killing someone), 'Welshmen' were clearly defined as being 'lesser' in law, due to the wergild payment for an Anglo Saxon was 2 to 5 times higher than that of a 'Welshman'.

There are some theories on why this discrimination was made-

>The imbalance in wergelds between the two groups may hold within it the very key to the disappearance of the Britons. The wergeld provided the basic honour price for an individual and represented the compensation that would be paid to his kin on his death. Other legal compensations, for injury to self or property, however defined, were computed as a proportion of one’s wergeld. The long term effects of Britons being valued at about half the wergeld of their English counterparts was that, in the normal course of things, large amounts of property would gradually pass from the British community to the English. [5](https://www.academia.edu/313138/Apartheid_and_Economics_in_Anglo_Saxon_England)  
>  
>If, for example, a hypothetical English and British nobleman each owning five hides of land got into a series of disputes with one another and were dealt with fairly by the courts, sometimes giving judgement in favour of the one and sometimes of the other, then all compensations paid by the Briton to the Englishman would be twice the value of those paid to him by his opponent. The end result would be that the property and finally the land would pass to the Englishman. [5](https://www.academia.edu/313138/Apartheid_and_Economics_in_Anglo_Saxon_England)

And

>The early Anglo-Saxon laws give some indication of the circumstances under which the British lived in Anglo-Saxon society. The law-code of Ine of Wessex, originating in the late seventh century, but preserved as an appendix to the ninth-century Laws of Alfred, gives three levels of wergild (compensation for killing a family member) for free Welshmen,  all  lower than  the  wergild  of  a West  Saxon  peasant 1  
>  
>It has also been pointed out that differential scales of wergild were a common method of reinforcing the balance of power between conquered and conquering peoples throughout medieval Europe 1  
>  
>it would have been an important means of cultural assimilation: successful Britons 'became' English, while remaining British was a sign of failure to prosper.1

And

>The inferior social position of the free Wealh is further shown in Ine's Laws, where a man charged with stealing or harbouring stolen cattle had to produce an oath of sixty hides if he were accused by a Wealh, whereas if the accuser were English the oath required was doubled. 9

**The usage of 'Welsh' and derogatory associations**

'Welsh' originally meant 'Romanised foreigner'. But the meaning changed over time to mean 'slave' and other derogatory association.

Britons were often slaves in Anglo Saxon society to the point that 'Welsh' also meant 'slave'.

>The derogatory connotations attached to *wealh* or the adjective *wilisc* are plentifully attested, from ‘shameful person’ to ‘bad servant’, while Ælfric equates *weala win* with crudum uinum (rough, inferior wine) and has a sinner speak *wealode mid wordum* (‘strangely’, ‘impudently’). These associations survive in present-day British slang words such as ‘*to welsh*’ (to cheat) and ‘*welsher*’ (an untrustworthy person). As Ryan Craig and Victoria Davis demonstrate, such discursive practices are not divorced from material realities and are often used to reinforce and sustain material inequity by creating ‘a reality in which it is reasonable for a few to control and to possess the material at the sacrifice of the well-being of others’. [3](https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/display/9781526136442/9781526136442.00018.xml)

And

>That it has given us modern English 'Welsh' shows, however, that a parallel ethnic meaning continued in use. This dual meaning must have arisen in an intermediate period, in which 'Briton' and 'slave' were for practical purposes identical. [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/13507489508568093?needAccess=true&role=button)  
>  
>In the tenth century, the writer of the West Saxon gospels used *weala* to translate the Latin seruus in the parable of the good and evil servants.This seruus was not of British descent, so the Old English word must mean simply 'slave'.[1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/13507489508568093?needAccess=true&role=button)  
>  
>Between these two stages must have been a period when more or less all Britons were slaves. [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/13507489508568093?needAccess=true&role=button)

And

>The verbal and adjectival forms derived from *wealh* reveal further extensions of its meanings and connotations. AEfric uses the verb with the meaning ""*to be bold, impudent, wanton*"":  
>  
>""He cwae bat he nolde and wealode mid wordum ""  
>  
>He said that he would not and was insolent in his speech"". Clearly related to this meaning is' *walana.*' translating Aldhelm's protervorum ""*shameless people*"" in the Old English gloss of unknown date contained in a tenth-century manuscript, and wealh ""wanton"" in '*Ic eom ondetta 6aet ic onfeng on minne mud wealworda*' in a tenth-century fragment from a Latin liber poenitentialis. Finally, in the eleventh-century glossary which seems to have been compiled from a number of glossed manuscripts, the Latin barbarus, which has the sense ""foreign, uncultivated or ignorant"" and in the thirteenth century meant ""barbarian"", is glossed by *walch siue ungerad*. Ungerad usually has the sense ""rude, unskilled, foolish, ignorant"", so again the more negative aspects of *wealh* are stressed. [9](https://www.proquest.com/openview/6262f86f5209a64d88030ca2377bc617/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1817601)

And

>The derogatory connotations of *wealh* spill over onto its derivative fonns. In his sermon for Ash Wednesday, Aelfric uses the verb *wealian* to mean ""to be impudent, bold, or wanton"": *he cwatJ pat he no/de and wealode mid wordum, I and sade pat he wolde his wifes brucan I on pam unalyfedum timan* [10](https://dokumen.pub/beowulfs-wealhtheow-and-the-valkyrie-tradition.html)

**Analysing how Anglo Saxon texts contained ideas that normalised the justification for colonising other countries**

>The ideas that enable later colonial expansion are already present in Anglo-Saxon texts, in both the Anglo-Latin original and the Old English translation and adaptations.  
>  
>Post-colonial criticism attends to power relationships and knowledge imbalances between colonizers and colonized. Post-colonial theory usually focuses on modern empires, on colonies or former colonies, and their subjects, on the notion of the ‘other,’ on who speaks on whose behalf. But it can also help to understand what happened when Angles and Saxons invaded Britain in the years following the Roman withdrawal and supplanted the native Britons in positions of influence and power. The Lives of Guthlac present that overthrow, as well as the subsequent battles between the ‘englisc,’ and the Welsh and Britons who continued to occupy the margins of Britain in Wales in the west as well as in the fens in the east, as legitimate, and in fact as being in no need of any justification.   
>  
>Attending to the ways in which a text like the Life of Guthlac normalizes and naturalizes conquest and power imbalances illuminates the development of a world-view that enables later colonizing operations to be undertaken as if it were legitimate for the English to subdue the Irish and, later, the inhabitants of North America, China, India, and Africa. [6](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zkjxx3)  
>  
>There is abundant evidence in early English culture, in this case its literature, to show that the foundations of British racism, colonialism, and imperialism underpin Western approaches to both other humans *and* the environment. [7](https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/tmr/article/view/25925/31617)  
>  
>The way in which early Anglo-Saxon authors envisioned history can be viewed as an important ideological model for the later American concept of historical identity. It is only by looking closely at early nationalist movements—through the ecclesiastical and secular, the myths and histories, and the conflation of both—can the level of British, or English, influence on America’s myth of Anglo-Saxonism be properly understood.

Wales,comment,Palestine Liberation Organization,jlt4h95,hellopo9,,"I think it's important to recognize that the Anglo-Saxon invasion and then migration were much more similar to the Spanish in Mexico than what happened to the USA. Despite significant mixing occurring, Mexican culture became overwhelmingly Spanish in language law, and art, similar to what happened to England. English people have significant Britonic ancestry and less than 50% Anglo-Saxon DNA (10-40% according to this study [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25788095/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25788095/)). English people I know naturally consider themselves directly descended from both the Celts and Saxons, in the same way, many Mexicans consider themselves descended from both the Native Americans and Spanish invaders.  While the 2022 paper you mentioned showed widespread replacement in the East of England (with the 10th-century burials in eastern England being 75% Germanic. The paper does also show that Britons and Saxons married and were buried next to each other along with their kids, so at that time most Saxons had one Celtic grandparent (75%). Research is unclear but there are also some indications that after the Norman invasion, many Celts moved back to the east and mixed in further.  Celtic lords in England married Saxons and vice versa shown by the name changes of their children (The line of the Celtic Cerdic of Wessex becoming anglicized for example). Looking back at what happened to the Brythonic culture it's awful how much was lost and horrific how many had to flee the raiders, but among the common Saxons and Bryonic celts mixing naturally occurred and people merged into one new people the English. I lived in Norfolk for a few years after I moved from Swansea and it was nice to see how people there revere Boudicca and how they keep those old cultural ties alive. All of this doesn't excuse Victorian (and modern) wankery to Wales from English aristocrats (and some of the general population) but we should recognize that the English do have Celtic elements from grammar, and place names to folk heroes and are proud to do so (increasing proud I personally find). I hope the English come to love their Celtic history more and in doing so love how Wales has preserved so many of the ancient traditions and language.",2023-05-27T10:48:31+00:00

Of course, that assumes logic.

Israeli flags have always struck me as a bit of an own goal by the loyalists anyway, like I know they're flown to spite the Palestinian flag but before Israel was busy cracking down on Palestine and fighting literally all its neighbours, they waged a vicious guerilla war against the British and killed a good number of British troops for their independence.

I think some irish republicans have tried to show solidarity with the palestinians and compare how their land was taken by the british by the creation of the state of israel which took palestinian arab land. so the irish republicans began to fly the palestinian flag and you'll always see it at Celtic games. So to piss off Republicans the loyalists began to fly the israeli flag again often seen at Ibrox park, and the DUP is pro Israel, whereas the ROI is something of an outlier in western europe for being quite pro palestinian.

The SDLP has yet to make a decision on whether the party will boycott the White House on St Patrick’s Day amid the continued Israeli bombardment of Gaza.

Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill confirmed earlier this week that party representatives will make the annual Washington DC trip in “pursuit of peace”.

The party’s decision has been met with criticism from pro-Palestinian campaigners.

People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said Sinn Féin’s plan to join the celebrations at the White House was a “violation of the most basic demands of the BDS (boycott, divestment and sanctions) movement against Israel

He claimed the Sinn Féin decision “will be opposed by many rank and file Sinn Féin members”, who he urged to challenge the party leadership on the issue.

Cork comedian Tadhg Hickey, who described himself as a “lifelong Sinn Féin voter”, said he was appalled by the decision.

A Sinn Féin spokesperson said successive US administrations had played a key role in the Irish peace process and that the party’s message was “that they need to adopt the same approach in relation to Palestine

The SDLP declined to comment on the party’s plans. In common with Sinn Féin, a decision to accept an invitation to the White House would likely prove unpopular with the its base.",2024-01-26T07:22:27+00:00

The fountain is the only loyalist area left on the Cityside, which is the west bank of the river.

northernireland,post,Hamas,17gfckv,Classy56,Sinn Féin voted against European Parliament motion condemning Hamas for attack on Israel," [https://m.independent.ie/irish-news/sinn-fein-voted-against-european-parliament-motion-condemning-hamas-for-attack-on-israel/a930287914.html](https://m.independent.ie/irish-news/sinn-fein-voted-against-european-parliament-motion-condemning-hamas-for-attack-on-israel/a930287914.html)

Sinn Féin voted against a European Parliament motion condemning the Hamas attack on Israel earlier this month, while People Before Profit has claimed many Israeli hostages are part of “occupation forces”.

Sinn Féin’s sole MEP Chris MacManus was one of four Irish MEPs who last Thursday voted down a motion strongly condemning the October 7 attacks, which left more than 1,400 Israelis dead.

The motion also called for the elimination of the “terrorist organisation ­Hamas”, as well as the release of hostages.

Independents Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan, Mick Wallace and Clare Daly were also among the 21 MEPs who voted down the motion, which also called for a “humanitarian pause” to allow the delivery of aid and for Israel’s response – which has left more than 5,000 people in Gaza dead – to be within international law.

It comes as People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy defended a leaflet distributed by his party which states “no one wants to see hostages taken but again, many of those taken are members of the occupation forces or settler movements”.

It has been widely reported that while some of the more than 200 hostages taken by Hamas militants are soldiers, many are civilians – including people with disabilities, children, grandparents and even a nine-month-old baby.

A People Before Profit activist’s email to TDs and senators last week claimed many of the Israeli civilians killed on October 7 were caught in crossfire between Hamas and the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) and “indeed, many were likely shot with IDF bullets”.

The email also cites hostages ­reported “being treated with dignity by Hamas fighters”.

Mr Murphy said Hamas is “a right-wing Islamist organisation” but declined to say if its members were terrorists.

“We are opposed to hostage-taking and the targeting of civilians,” he said.

“We call for the release of all the hostages held by Hamas and the release of over 10,000 Palestinian prisoners held as hostages by Israel, including thousands who are being held without charge or trial, and hundreds of children.” He said people should “continue to bombard TDs” with emails asking them to condemn “genocide by Israel and advocate for an immediate ceasefire”.

 Mr MacManus defended his vote last week, saying the resolution was “not sufficient to deal with the catastrophe happening before our eyes”. 

 He said he consistently voted to ­condemn Hamas in separate votes on parts of the resolution, but said the final version was “unbalanced”, adding: “Anybody who is serious about addressing the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is calling for a ceasefire.”

In a joint statement, Mr Wallace and Ms Daly said: “We reject this resolution and we think ordinary Irish people will feel the same when they read it.

“The resolution is completely silent in relation to Israel’s treatment of ­Palestinian people to date. It acts as though history began on the 7th of ­October. There is no mention of Israel’s crimes against humanity.”

They said the resolution does not call for a ceasefire but instead ­“fudges” that point.

 “It’s an appalling and dangerous statement on behalf of the parliament. It uses the language of terrorism in relation to Hamas, but Israel’s actions are portrayed as a legitimate response,” the MEPs added. ",2023-10-25T21:16:39+00:00

Israel has always had the opportunity for long-lasting peace via undermining the reason that insurgency exists in the first place. They could reverse the nakba, they could return occupied territories, they could meaningfully reconcile - but why do any of that when you could just carry out ethnic cleansing in plain view and still receive support from the west while doing so?",2023-10-25T23:54:02+00:00

I'd strongly disagree. I criticise the Israeli government's policy a lot, whether it be on Iran, the West Bank/Gaza, social issues, etc. But use of that language is clearly anti-semitism.

I've been to Israel before, and I have been inside the part of Jerusalem that's inside the West Bank, and my family also has ties to Jewish friends who have lived in Israel and are now living in Canada, the US or those who are still living in Russia or Ukraine.

Let me say this, it is easy to criticise the actions of the Israeli government and Israeli policy and keep it to that, it's also very easy to not use anti-semitic language. Zionism is a very weird topic and generally speaking, when criticising the actions of a government, just avoid the use of the term, ""Zionism"".

How? Nazi scum was used in the context of a mural containing the IDF logo and history of a Zionist from here. Zionism is a belief that enables an apartheid and tiered society, it enables Israeli Zionists to look at Palestinians as lesser beings - much like the Third Reich saw Jews (and a lot of other minorities) as being 'lesser' humans. It wasn't always this way, Zionism use to accept Palestine/accept partition and a two state policy, but that has changed.

I live with a Canadian Jew, and I have nothing against any Jews - my favourite YouTubers are both Jewish and part Israeli and vlog from Israel a couple times a year - I'm not calling all Israelis Zionists. That being said Benjamin Netanyahus Zionist government should and will be condemned by anyone with an interest in human rights. If they want that sort of shit to stop then they should stop the mass human rights abuses they're engaging in. Zionism needs to be opposed full stop.

How is Zionism an antisemitic term? It is a real ideology within the ruling party of Israel - Benjamin Netanyahus own family contains high profile Zionist activists.",2017-03-18T20:38:53+00:00

Pretty much, anti-Zionism was the motivation of the anti-semities, and was one of the things which the National Socialists said when they were commiting the attrocities of the Holocaust/Shoah.

Comparison of Israel to anything commited by National Socialism is also considered anti-semitic and is consider by extension to be a form of Holocaust Denial.

What sort of perverted logic is this? Drawing comparisons between Nazis and the current Israeli government is a form of holocaust denial? *What?* The fact is the Third Reich attempted to expand their land much like the current government - they viewed people of a specific ethnicity to be 'lesser humans', much like the current gov of Israel (even if they don't admit that in polite conversation). The collective punishment that Israel engages in, that involves at times, indiscriminate murder of Palestinians can pretty easily compared to the indiscriminate murder of Jews by the Nazis. If anything, calling comparisons between the two 'Holocaust denial' is a form of denying that Israel engages in this mass murder and colonial behaviour. The current gov of Israel has turned Gaza into something akin to a massive open air prison camp - it's besieged (AKA 'guarded') by land sea and air.

> In other words, if you claim you are against Zionism, because no one has solidly defined Zionism as one thing or the other, you can be considered by many to be anti-Israel, and anti-Jewish.

Zionism may have been understood as something different back in the day, but nowadays it has become synonymous with ultra-Right anti-Palestinian behaviour. Both in the media and in politics and socially. It's like how Republicanism here used to be all about Irish independence and was supported by some members from all communities but now it is associated with hardcore leftists from a predominately catholic community. How things are perceived changes, and the current definition of Zionism seems to be ultra-right and anti-Palestinian.",2017-03-18T21:14:58+00:00

They are treated thoroughly like second class citizens and the global media is quiet about it. Then you have these spasms of violence, with this one being particularly brutal (the timing is interesting, as is the role Iran may have played in it) and suddenly everyone pays attention to it, thousands die, peace for a bit, no one cares again, rinse repeat. 

In many ways the Troubles were simpler because there were fewer outside influences involved. Irish Americans pressured the US to do something, whereas the Jewish lobby is so powerful in the US that'd never be possible for this. Arab nations are normalising relations with Israel, despite all this and despite the presence of refugee camps filed with Palestinians within their borders (the reason they're in camps 70 years on is itself worthy of a post), and Saudi Arabia and Iran, the local hegemons, will watch with interest. 

One side could end this tomorrow, Israel could sit down with Hamas or the PA and hash out an acceptable deal - that would probably, at this point, be unacceptable to many, like the provisions in the Good Friday Agreement letting paramilitaries out. Neither side wants to though: Netanyahu gets to play war hero and avoid being fucked out of office and Hamas get to continue creating more martyrs for their cause and maintaining their stranglehold.on Gaza. 

It's a sorry fucking situation, OP, and one that I agree people shouldn't be rushing to cheerlead like a football team. It is much harder to see what Israel's goals will be when they launch their ground incursion this time, and I fear tens of thousands will probably die.

The Jewish population in British Palestine absolutely skyrocketed once the Nazi party  won power in Germany. 
The population in British Palestine remained largely Arab, but the Jewish people were allocated the vast majority of the Palestinian land despite being the minority.  This caused the conflict to escalate into a civil war and the British withdrew.  
America has supported the Jewish state for reasons that are self-explanatory. Israel is now largely a military state, with stark similarities how to America functions, the state's ideology is far beyond 'western leaning'.  
Throughout the decades of conflict, Israel has acted to degrade the Palestinian territories and its people via putting in place blockades, starvation, and measures that are tantamount to ethnic cleansing.  The Palestinian Arabs would have been deciminated years ago, but they are being effectively propped up by Iran and Lebanon, facilitated by Egypt.  
Those sympathetic to Israel would consider their tactics a reasonable response to the constant missiles flying overhead from Gaza and the civil unrest of the West Bank.  Those sympathic to the Palestinian Arabs would argue that they have the right to defend themselves and fight the war outside of their own territories.  Some would even defend the massacre that occurred at the music festival in Southern Israel at the weekend.
This current escalation of violence is utterly devastating to watch unfold. Hundreds of innocent civilians and children dead.  Another failure of humanity repeating itself.
I suspect there are political reasons for this latest assault by Hamas. The timing is telling.

northernireland,comment,Israel-Palestine Conflict/Conflict,deq2g43,runawayvibrator,,"The Story So Far is that Jewish people lived in what is currently called Palestine a thousand or two years ago, but were conquered by a wide variety of other people and eventually sent into a known-world-wide diaspora. This is why you find Jewish people throughout the Middle East, Europe and Asia. The Jewish people are persecuted in most of these places, mostly because they are a minority and tend to keep to themselves, and occasionally take jobs that make other people not like you (e.g., bankers). That's another story though. The Jewish people manage to persevere, though, and consider the Land of Israel to be their homeland to which The Messiah will some day return them.

Around the late-1800s, some Jewish people got tired of waiting for The Messiah, and the Zionist Movement was founded. These were people dedicated to creating a Jewish homeland. Preferably in Israel but they were willing to negotiate. In the early 1900s they established a fund to help this happen.

At the time, Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire, and this fund was used to buy land (perfectly legally) in Palestine from the people who lived there at the time (the ancestors of modern-day Palestinians but then known simply as ""Arabs"") and start settlements into which Jewish immigrants were settled. Some of Israel's largest modern cities (such as Tel Aviv) were started around this time.

There was a law at the time stating that a settlement was legal if it was surrounded by a wall and had a watchtower. Jewish people would go over to unclaimed lands at night, and before morning would surround a large area with a wall and build a watchtower. Wham, instant settlement. And they did a lot of this right near Arab lands.
This was perfectly legal at the time, but obviously lead to some friction, as you might imagine. The Muslim Arabs were worried about a lot of Jewish people moving in next door.
In the 1920s, after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the newly formed League of Nations declared Palestine to be a British mandate. The British, well aware of the tensions between the Arabs and the Jews, tried to calm things down by simply disallowing Jewish immigration to Palestine. This lead to a lot of illegal immigration - Jewish people would cram into tiny boats and sail in under cover of night, to be met on the shore by established settlers. More overnight settlements popped up, and more tension between the Jews and Arabs, and the Jews and British! The Jewish settlers utilised a lot of terrorist tactics at this time. The whole thing was kinda chaotic.

Bottom line from all this is that the Arabs were worried/mad at the Jews moving into their territory, whereas the Jews believed they were fulfilling their destiny and moving back to their homeland - and were doing it (mostly) legally - buying lands, starting legal settlements, etc - until the British outlawed immigration (but even then, they were buying and settling legally).

After World War II, when the aftermath and absolute horrors of The Holocaust were revealed, the world decided that yeah, maybe the Jewish people should have their own homeland. The Balfour Deceleration, all the way back in 1917, had the British stating their support for establishing a Jewish Homeland in Palestine. The newly formed UN voted on this, and in 1948 the State of Israel declared it's independence.
The very next day, the entire rest of the Middle East started a war against them. They lost.
There were a few more minor wars after that. Then in 1967, there was a major one.
When I say ""major"", I don't mean by length. It is known in Israel as ""The Six-Day War"". In it Israel was attacked by seven of it's neighbours, who were thoroughly defeated to such a degree that Israel pushed it's own borders to more ""natural"" geographical areas - they pushed the border with Syria farther north, taking over the Golan Heights, with Jordan up to the Jordan river, taking over The West Bank and East Jerusalem, and pushed the border with Egypt all the way to the Suez Canal, taking over Gaza and the entire Sinai Peninsula.
So this kinda sucked for the Arabs living in The West Bank and the Gaza Strip. They were now part of Israel.
Israel actually tried to integrate them. Many received full Israeli citizenship, with full rights. the only exception to this was that they were exempt from military service.

Then, in 1987, it all went to hell.
It was one of those things that just escalates out of hand rather than people just sitting down and $%&* talking to each other. There were some problems at a refugee camp, both Arabs and Israelis being killed, then some riots, then an Israeli army truck hit a car, killing four Palestinians, and people decide it was intentional and molotov cocktails start flying.

Right now, the whole area is a powder-keg and is basically fucked.",2017-03-09T20:37:48+00:00

Asked in an interview with Radio Kol Berama whether an atomic bomb should be dropped on the enclave, Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu says “this is one of the possibilities.”

Eliyahu, of Itamar Ben Gvir’s far-right party, is not part of the security cabinet which is involved in the wartime decision-making, nor does he hold sway over the war cabinet directing the war against the Hamas terror group.

Eliyahu also voices his objection during the interview to allowing any humanitarian aid into Gaza, saying “we wouldn’t hand the Nazis humanitarian aid,” and charging that “there is no such thing as uninvolved civilians in Gaza.”

He backs retaking the Strip’s territory and restoring the settlements there. Asked about the fate of the Palestinian population, he says: “They can go to Ireland or deserts, the monsters in Gaza should find a solution by themselves.”

He says the northern Strip has no right to exist, adding that anyone waving a Palestinian or Hamas flag “shouldn’t continue living on the face of the earth.”",2023-11-05T17:53:18+00:00

Tanaiste Micheal Martin has warned that it would be “catastrophic” if more countries ceased funding the UN agency that works with Palestinian refugees in Gaza, and said that countries - including the US and UK - which have pulled funding “have acted far too prematurely”.

Several donor countries have halted aid after allegations that a small number of United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unwra) staff were involved in the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7th that precipitated the current round of violence. The UN has appealed for aid to continue.

“Ireland is a strong contributor and the bottom line is that without Unwra the humanitarian situation would become even more catastrophic in Gaza and in the West Bank,” Mr Martin told reporters in Cork on Sunday. “And don’t forget that Unwra also supports millions of refugees in Jordan and elsewhere so it’s hugely important agency, employing up to 30,000 people, 13,000 alone in Gaza.

“That’s the context and people have to put this in perspective in terms of allegations against a number of workers on the ground and to pull out the entire programme, I think, it would be catastrophic in terms of the daily humanitarian needs of Gazans in particular in the midst of a most terrible conflict,” Mr Martin added.

Mr Martin also said Ireland would “talk to other countries” about possibly supporting the South African case in the International Court of Justice which alleges genocide by Israel against the Palestinians.

Earlier, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said she would personally like Ireland to formally support South Africa’s case against Israel.

Separately, the Palestinian ambassador to Ireland has said she would not advocate for representatives of the Government or the Opposition to turn down invitations to the White House on St Patrick’s Day.

Dr Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid, the head of the Mission of the State of Palestine, said she would “respect” whatever decision Irish politicians made about the annual US trip. “I wouldn’t say go or not to go ... I know how important this visit is,” she said.

Sinn Féin has faced criticism from People Before Profit and pro-Palestine campaign groups over its plan to attend the St Patrick’s Day events in Washington, due to US support for Israel in the conflict.

The Palestinian ambassador said she hoped Irish politicians attending engagements in the White House and Capitol Hill raised the war in Gaza “in a serious way” during any talks with the US administration.

“Please keep the just cause of Palestinians in your hearts, your minds, in your talks,” she said. Ireland should try to use its close relationship with the US to push the case for a ceasefire in Gaza and self determination for Palestinians, she said.

In a statement in recent days, Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O’Neill said the party would be travelling to the US on the annual trip “in the pursuit of peace”. She said Sinn Féin would “advocate for an end to the Israeli genocidal war and occupation in Gaza and the West Bank”, as well as call for a “peace process in Palestine” during the trip.

The Irish Palestinian Solidarity Campaign has called on all politicians to turn down invitations to travel to the US to meet President Joe Biden on St Patrick’s Day. “This was our view long before Israel’s genocidal assault on the people of Gaza,” the campaign group said in a recent statement.",2024-01-28T20:45:43+00:00

> *The council passed two motions on the conflict condemning violence in both Israel and Palestine*

> A Northern Ireland council is calling for the expulsion of Israeli ambassadors by the Irish and British governments over the ""genocidal siege of Gaza"".

> Derry City and Strabane council backed the motion, put forward by People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin, after the largest party on the council - Sinn Fein - opted not to vote.

> Councillor Harkin said: ""We need to do everything we can to stop Israel's genocidal siege of Gaza. We need to bring as much pressure on the British and US governments and the EU to stop Israel's assault.""

> The vote took place against the backdrop of the deepening conflict in the Middle East as civilians continue to suffer under a total siege imposed by Israel in the wake of an unprecedented incursion by Hamas militants.

> The United Nations, senior EU figures and aid agencies have all expressed alarm as many Palestinians struggle to flee ahead of a “co-ordinated” offensive in the Gaza Strip involving air, ground and naval forces.

> An SDLP motion was also backed by Derry and Strabane council on Wednesday that condemned the ""horrifying violence and indiscriminate murder of civilians in Gaza and southern Israel"", called for a ceasefire, the release of hostages taken by Hamas, backed an investigation of potential war crimes, and called for a two-state solution.

> That motion was put forward by SDLP councillor Brian Tierney, who said: ""That's what we think should happen. We have put a bit of work into this. We have done a bit of communication with people who are in Palestine who are impacted by what's going on there.

> ""This is what our understanding of what the people out there want.""

> Mr Tierney's motion was passed with 26 votes in favour, none against with 11 councillors abstaining.

> Councillor Harkin's motion, meanwhile, went a step further and called for the council to write to the Irish and British governments to call for ""an immediate cessation of the bombardment and genocidal siege of Gaza; and for the immediate expulsion of Israeli ambassadors"".

> UUP councillor Ryan McCready, a decorated former soldier who served with the British army in the Middle East, was one of several councillors who spoke to condemn Hamas during the debate, describing the group as ""an extension of ISIS and Daesh"" who would have ""no problem"" beheading infidels.

> On the expulsion of Israeli diplomats, he said there should be ""more dialogue, not less dialogue"".

> Sinn Fein group leader Christopher Jackson explained his party's position: ""What we can't ignore is that there's women and children being slaughtered on a daily basis in Gaza - an area the size of this council area with two million people, fifty per cent of them are children.

> ""The information and the feedback we're receiving on a daily basis from leaders within Palestine is that they want a focus on the immediate cessation of indiscriminate bombing, and for international law to be completely respected.

> ""It's been ignored for decades now but the focus needs to be on those key asks.""

> Mr Harkin, meanwhile, said: ""Palestinian refugees who are scattered across the world, six million of them, are looking to the people of Ireland to take a really strong stand. I believe the people of Ireland have been doing that and I believe we have to put pressure on the Irish government in particular to take a stand that is in line with what the vast majority of people across this island actually believe.

> ""I think calling for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador is a small step towards that, because what it says is Israel is a pariah state. Apartheid Israel, what it's doing to people in Gaza and what it's doing to people across Palestine is unacceptable.""

> The People Before Profit motion passed with 12 votes in favour, eight against and 17 abstentions.",2023-10-25T16:39:23+00:00

northernireland,post,IDF,17gfckv,Classy56,Sinn Féin voted against European Parliament motion condemning Hamas for attack on Israel," [https://m.independent.ie/irish-news/sinn-fein-voted-against-european-parliament-motion-condemning-hamas-for-attack-on-israel/a930287914.html](https://m.independent.ie/irish-news/sinn-fein-voted-against-european-parliament-motion-condemning-hamas-for-attack-on-israel/a930287914.html)

Sinn Féin voted against a European Parliament motion condemning the Hamas attack on Israel earlier this month, while People Before Profit has claimed many Israeli hostages are part of “occupation forces”.

Sinn Féin’s sole MEP Chris MacManus was one of four Irish MEPs who last Thursday voted down a motion strongly condemning the October 7 attacks, which left more than 1,400 Israelis dead.

The motion also called for the elimination of the “terrorist organisation ­Hamas”, as well as the release of hostages.

Independents Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan, Mick Wallace and Clare Daly were also among the 21 MEPs who voted down the motion, which also called for a “humanitarian pause” to allow the delivery of aid and for Israel’s response – which has left more than 5,000 people in Gaza dead – to be within international law.

It comes as People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy defended a leaflet distributed by his party which states “no one wants to see hostages taken but again, many of those taken are members of the occupation forces or settler movements”.

It has been widely reported that while some of the more than 200 hostages taken by Hamas militants are soldiers, many are civilians – including people with disabilities, children, grandparents and even a nine-month-old baby.

A People Before Profit activist’s email to TDs and senators last week claimed many of the Israeli civilians killed on October 7 were caught in crossfire between Hamas and the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) and “indeed, many were likely shot with IDF bullets”.

The email also cites hostages ­reported “being treated with dignity by Hamas fighters”.

Mr Murphy said Hamas is “a right-wing Islamist organisation” but declined to say if its members were terrorists.

“We are opposed to hostage-taking and the targeting of civilians,” he said.

“We call for the release of all the hostages held by Hamas and the release of over 10,000 Palestinian prisoners held as hostages by Israel, including thousands who are being held without charge or trial, and hundreds of children.” He said people should “continue to bombard TDs” with emails asking them to condemn “genocide by Israel and advocate for an immediate ceasefire”.

 Mr MacManus defended his vote last week, saying the resolution was “not sufficient to deal with the catastrophe happening before our eyes”. 

 He said he consistently voted to ­condemn Hamas in separate votes on parts of the resolution, but said the final version was “unbalanced”, adding: “Anybody who is serious about addressing the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is calling for a ceasefire.”

In a joint statement, Mr Wallace and Ms Daly said: “We reject this resolution and we think ordinary Irish people will feel the same when they read it.

“The resolution is completely silent in relation to Israel’s treatment of ­Palestinian people to date. It acts as though history began on the 7th of ­October. There is no mention of Israel’s crimes against humanity.”

They said the resolution does not call for a ceasefire but instead ­“fudges” that point.

 “It’s an appalling and dangerous statement on behalf of the parliament. It uses the language of terrorism in relation to Hamas, but Israel’s actions are portrayed as a legitimate response,” the MEPs added. ",2023-10-25T21:16:39+00:00

A People Before Profit activist’s email to TDs and senators last week claimed many of the Israeli civilians killed on October 7 were caught in crossfire between Hamas and the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) and “indeed, many were likely shot with IDF bullets”.

The email also cites hostages ­reported “being treated with dignity by Hamas fighters”.

Mr Murphy said Hamas is “a right-wing Islamist organisation” but declined to say if its members were terrorists.

“We are opposed to hostage-taking and the targeting of civilians,” he said.

“We call for the release of all the hostages held by Hamas and the release of over 10,000 Palestinian prisoners held as hostages by Israel, including thousands who are being held without charge or trial, and hundreds of children.” He said people should “continue to bombard TDs” with emails asking them to condemn “genocide by Israel and advocate for an immediate ceasefire”.

 Mr MacManus defended his vote last week, saying the resolution was “not sufficient to deal with the catastrophe happening before our eyes”. 

 He said he consistently voted to ­condemn Hamas in separate votes on parts of the resolution, but said the final version was “unbalanced”, adding: “Anybody who is serious about addressing the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is calling for a ceasefire.”

In a joint statement, Mr Wallace and Ms Daly said: “We reject this resolution and we think ordinary Irish people will feel the same when they read it.

“The resolution is completely silent in relation to Israel’s treatment of ­Palestinian people to date. It acts as though history began on the 7th of ­October. There is no mention of Israel’s crimes against humanity.”

They said the resolution does not call for a ceasefire but instead ­“fudges” that point.

 “It’s an appalling and dangerous statement on behalf of the parliament. It uses the language of terrorism in relation to Hamas, but Israel’s actions are portrayed as a legitimate response,” the MEPs added. ",2023-10-25T21:16:39+00:00

 Kneecap in Dublin: It’s not rage that the punk-rap three-piece conjure. It’s joy

Kneecap are teetering on the precipice of something they probably could only have dreamed of

Kneecap

Olympia Theatre

★★★★☆

Is there a more buzzed about Irish group right now? The punk-rap three-piece Kneecap – Mo Chara, Móglaí Bap, DJ Próvaí – are teetering on the precipice of something they probably could only have dreamed of a few years ago, yet have willed into being through graft, talent, and a natural refusal to deviate from who they are.

January will see the group premiere their debut feature film – loosely based on their lives and ascent – on the opening night of Sundance, making it the first Irish-language film ever selected for the largest independent film festival in the United States. This will be followed by a North America tour in March, with venue sizes already increasing following their recent autumn tour there. Their yet-to-be-released debut album, recorded in London and produced by Toddla T, has been preceded by a single featuring Grian Chatten of Fontaines DC.

This show is the first of a series closing out 2023; two nights at the 3Olympia in Dublin, followed by Derry, Belfast, and Cork. They’ve certainly come a long way from getting thrown out of their own gigs.

The crowd is leaping from the start, kids in Idles and Lankum T-shirts, pint-splashed Palestine flags waving. The room goes to black. Two men in opposite balcony boxes are spotlit, wearing DJ Próvaí's trademark tricolour knitted balaclava. The roar becomes a scream as the group arrives, launching into their 2023 single, It’s Been Ages: “Oh it’s been ages, since we made the front pages. Sin deireadh linn ár hiatus.”

Live, Mo Chara occupies a sort of púca persona, riling the crowd up, full of devilment. Móglaí Bap is casually languid. DJ Próvaí acts as a demented ringleader. By the end of the show he’s deep in the crowd, held aloft, scrambling over shoulders and heads while his bandmates on stage swig liberally from bottles of Buckfast.

Before that, a brace of new tracks lands mid-set, signalling a diversification of sound and theme – one rooted in lyrics part-concerned with mental health, another a summer party tune. On another new track, a mosh pit forms with the words FINE ART flashing on the screen. Thart agus Thart, one of their finest tracks to date – a downtempo meditation on the listlessness of lockdowns – is a highlight.

Kneecap is, strangely, occupying a sort of liminal space with their fans; the album isn’t out, and so songs are being tested, teased, with some going off in the room as though they are familiar, rather than the first time the vast majority have heard them. One compelling piece came before the encore, a rave tune driven by a sentiment of love-filled unity.

The song that began their self-led Irish language revolution in rap sees the crowd singing the hook long after the track has finished: “C.E.A.R.T.A.” The track, Get Your Brits Out, a tale of fantasy about bringing members of the DUP to a drug-fuelled party and attempting to get on famously, instigates multiple mosh pits.

At the end, a moment of beauty takes hold, the crowd united in a singsong while the artists hand out bottles of beer to stretching hands. One realises, it’s not rage at all that Kneecap, live, conjure. It’s joy.

Dear /r/England 


I might be relocating to England (a cool job offer), but I haven’t the slightest clue on what life in the UK is like. (Sorry for stealing your jobs but I’m a highly qualified worker and there wasn’t anybody there that does what I do)


My job offer is somewhere around 62k an year. My office would be located close to Heathrow they told me. I believe West London correct?


Can you guys help me out on what my life would be like there?

* What bank should I use(in case they don’t force one on me)? 

* What mobile carrier is the best and has the best mobile internet?

* Where should I live? – is it easy to rent there? –should I go for a house or for an apartment?

* How should I get around? Should I buy a car, a motorcycle? Used or new?

* Can I pay all my bills via the internet like I can here in Brasil or do I have to send something in like some of those heathens is the US?

62k is 170k Reais(Brasilian money) , this is roughly 14k reais a month, minus taxes, lets say 10k a month, which is still a lot of money. 


Here in sao paulo currenty I have :

* Ford Focus – 60k reais -  about 1500reais/month for 48 months

* a smartphone with internet  - 300 reais/month

* an apartment around 95m^2  - 1800 reais/month

* take the wife out to dinner every weekend (lets say the usual bill is 180 reais at normal restaurants ) 360 reais for the weekend - 1440/month   

* cable TV  with 5mbs high speed internet - 200 reais/month

*  medical insurance, car insurance, motorcycle insurance – 300 reais/month

* a bike, an electric bike and a bike for the wife. 5000 reais

* psychologist  once a week – 700 reais/month

* gym membership – 400 reais/month

* 500 reais a month spending money

How much am I looking at spending to have something similar in London(or England)?

england,comment,West Bank,c2qgfz6,Airazz,,"£62k is a lot of money, if you're going to be working a normal 40-hour week.

Apartment prices vary, but you can find a nice place for some 500-800 per month or a bit less, just need to look for it. It really depends on the quality that you want, older houses are naturally cheaper. Obviously, you could share an apartment/house with other people which would greatly reduce the price, but this option is probably more for students.

As for transport, the public version is brilliant, especially the tube. Whether you should buy a car depends on how old you are, mostly. Insurance for young people (even with a small and weak car) can be more than £4000 per year.

As for mobile internet, there are many options. I myself use GiffGaff, it operates on O2 network (available everywhere, good signal), for £10 per month they give 250 UK minutes, unlimited texts and unlimited internet (no tethering, though).

As for bills, yes. If you have UK bank account, then you can simply set up Direct Debit and they will take money straight from your account. It's cheaper and simpler than other options. You can pay each bill separately online if you want, or in the local post office.

Food is not very expensive if you cook yourself. I personally eat plenty of good and healthy food for some £30 per week, but then again, I shop in Lidl (which is pretty much the cheapest in UK) and vegetables from the local market. Prices are not much smaller, but quality really beats every supermarket.

Hope this helps and congrats with the new job!",2011-10-11T01:43:52+00:00

england,comment,West Bank,c2qq2vi,GuyOnTheInterweb,,"Use any bank you like, as long as they are able to offer you a normal Current Account. Some will only offer a Basic Account to fresh foreigners, but just flash that £62k contract, and the doors will open. Do not sign up for those ""Advantage"" accounts which with a ""small"" fee promise you lots of ""free"" extras you will never use and can find much better deals for elsewhere.

Easiest as a fresh resident is to bring with you some letter of reference from the company you are started with, addressed to ""The Manager, Blahdie Bank, So-Ho branch, NW1 2ET"". As such you will probably go for one of the big high-street banks like Santander, RBS, HSBC, Halifax so you can talk to someone in person, don't try to open an account online at this stage. 

The different banks have very varying quality on their internet banking solutions - go try their demos online before you choose :)

You will need to build up a good credit history before you will be able to apply for credit cards, in-store credits, or even a monthly mobile contract. (If you apply for credit, and get rejected, this will be recorded on the file of the credit reference agencies, and make it harder to get other credit later!) As a freshly arrived foreigner you will be totally unknown to the agencies which are used to assess who you are and what your credit history is. There are only 3 companies: Equifax, Experian and CallCredit - and you can get free trials and statutory reports to see what they have on you.

A common trick is to get a very crap ""[Credit Builder](http://www.moneysupermarket.com/credit-cards/credit-cards-v2-credit-builder/)"" card like Capital One, use it, and pay it off in full every month. This will appear on the credit history as a good creditor, and after say 8 months it should be easier. Note though, that if the deal sounds too good (like ""Pay in 4 years, no interest""), then they will be pickier on who they want as customers.

http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/ have lots of these kind of good advise - not just for saving money (which you won't have to worry too much about), but also explaining how everything work.

england,comment,West Bank,c2rwqhi,,,">My job offer is somewhere around 62k an year. My office would be located close to Heathrow they told me. I believe West London correct?

Heathrow is very much south west london, have a look at the [tube map](http://mynokiablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/london-underground-tube-map.gif) to get an idea. 

>What bank should I use(in case they don’t force one on me)?

Find the one nearest to your house/office, that's the rule I live by, however in terms to customer service first direct win all the awards, you have to earn more than £30k or something to use them or else you have to pay so they make a really big deal out of being good.

>What mobile carrier is the best and has the best mobile internet?

giffgaff are the only network that have unlimited mobile internet, so I use them, they're also really cheap however you can't tether, if you do they block your internet. All the networks are pretty similar, three have the best mobile broadband dongles in terms of speed. O2, T-mobile, orange and vodafone are your other options

>Where should I live? – is it easy to rent there? –should I go for a house or for an apartment?

Use the tube map to gauge areas, personally I'd look at areas like ealing, shepards bush etc if you're going to drive to work. Otherwise your best bet is to get the heathrow express from paddington, its much faster than the tube or driving in which case I'd live in North or North west london. Finding a house is really easy, just avoid foxtons (estate agents - just do a google search and look at the number of people suing them!) but housing is very expensive, you're earning enough to get somewhere really nice though, if you want.

>How should I get around? Should I buy a car, a motorcycle? Used or new?

You can easily live in london without a car, parking might be an issue if you get one, be prepared to pay to park outside your flat... However, you work in heathrow, so depending on how close the office is to a train station it will probably be a lot easier to drive.

>Can I pay all my bills via the internet like I can here in Brasil or do I have to send something in like some of those heathens is the US?

Most bills will probably be direct debit (this is the easiest way, its what most people do) so they'll just take the money from your account, some people don't like that in which case you can use internet banking to send money to companies using a customer number as a reference.

Other things you mention - I've just missed things out if I don't know.


* Ford Focus – I'd buy newish second hand, cost really depends on how much you drive (petrol is expensive!)
* a smartphone with internet - ~£20-30/month
* an apartment around 95m2 - at least £1000/month in zone 2/3
* take the wife out to dinner every weekend - impossible to say, in London you can spend as much or as little as you want. For something nice though, +£25 per person + drinks
* cable TV with 5mbs high speed internet - ~£30 (virgin media is best for speed, they also do cable tv and phones and stuff) your other TV option is Sky, who also do internet but its not as fast, also you have to pay a TV license which is about £10/month.
* medical insurance, car insurance, motorcycle insurance – only get medical insurance if your company give it to you, otherwise just use the NHS, medical insurance is only any good if you have a massive operation or something, when you can cut the waiting times a bit. car/bike insurance - have a look on gocompare.com to compare prices, if you're renting you only need to worry about home contents insurance and obviously that depends on what you own, but its generally pretty cheap. less easily less than £20 a month, unless you're stockpiling jewels or something.
* gym membership – ~£50/month for a pretty good private gym like fitness first, council run gyms will be more like £30, and the upper limit is as high as you want....

Also

Elec/gas/water I usually budget £60 a month, but obviously it really depends how much you use.


Oh and don't forget that the taxman is going to get his greasy little fingers in your earnings, [This](http://listentotaxman.com/index.php) website will work out what your take home will be. - Prepared to get pissed off.

england,comment,West Bank,c2qm6u2,abw,,"A lot depends on where ""near Heathrow"" is.  If it's somewhere like [Stockley Park](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=stockley+park) (a big business park just north of Heathrow) then I'd look at getting a car/motorbike and living somewhere just outside of the M25 (big circle around London, so outside would be west in this case).  If it's further in towards London then I'm the wrong person to ask... but I'll offer some advice in case it is on or around SP/Heathrow...

As a general rule, places south of the M4 (running east/west into London) are nicer than places north.  e.g. [Egham](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=egham&hl=en&sll=51.500408,-0.47636&sspn=0.099915,0.174923&vpsrc=0&hnear=Egham,+United+Kingdom&t=h&z=14), [Old Windsor](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=old+windsor&hl=en&ll=51.458285,-0.586739&spn=0.100007,0.174923&sll=51.479995,-0.605996&sspn=0.099959,0.174923&vpsrc=0&hnear=Old+Windsor,+Windsor,+Windsor+and+Maidenhead,+United+Kingdom&t=h&z=13) and [Windsor](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=windsor&hl=en&sll=51.430751,-0.548153&sspn=0.050034,0.087461&vpsrc=0&hnear=Windsor,+Windsor+and+Maidenhead,+United+Kingdom&t=h&z=13) are very nice (the Queen has a castle there), [Slough](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=slough&hl=en&ll=51.509384,-0.595493&spn=0.099895,0.174923&sll=51.458285,-0.586739&sspn=0.100007,0.174923&vpsrc=0&hnear=Slough,+United+Kingdom&t=h&z=13) isn't.

For, say, £1000 you'll be able to rent a 2 bedroom apartment in Old Windsor or a 4 bedroom house in Slough.  Old Windsor is about 20 minutes away from Stockley Park by car, Slough a little further (traffic depending).  [RightMove](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/) is probably the best web site for property in the UK (it's my favourite, at least).

Don't buy a new car/motorbike, get one second hand.  If you go to a car dealer then you can get one that's only a year or two old, but it'll be significantly cheaper than a brand new one, and often have the same manufacturer/dealer warranty.  If you're not too fussed about having a new/flashy car, then you can pick something nice up for a few thousand.  If you really don't care, you can get an old banger for a few hundred, but it might not last long and the maintenance could be high.  If you're further in towards London then a motorbike is going to be much better in the heavy traffic than a car.  Google(.co.uk) will help you find a car dealer in the area.  Buying privately (e.g. from a newspaper ad) is cheaper, but more risky if you don't know enough about cars to evaluate it.  You can pay [The AA](http://www.theaa.com/motoring-advice/car-checking.html) to check out a car for you.  Even with their fee, it'll be cheaper than a dealer.  But you won't be short of cash with that kind of salary, so you might be better off going to a dealer for peace of mind.

england,comment,West Bank,c2qpqem,GuyOnTheInterweb,,"Note about cars (which personally I would avoid in London), if you have a Brazilian driving license, you can [drive on a foreign license for the first 12 months](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/DriverLicensing/DrivingInGbOnAForeignLicence/DG_4022561), within which time you will need to apply for the Provisional Driving license and take a theoretical and practical driving test. As the traffic patterns are probably quite different from Brazil (read: not as creative), you might want to take some driving lessons to understand the technical bits that are easy to fail as a foreigner, say 10-12 hours. Big names include AA, BSM, Bill Plant, but there would be plenty of independent local instructors as well.

Driving on a foreign/non-EEA license is likely to exclude most insurance companies, and be quite expensive on the remaining ones. However, if you've also got a provisional license (which is just paperwork), it might help. ",2011-10-11T23:12:51+00:00

Note that the London rental market is fairly stressed, so you have to be quick to decide. Note however that (I think special for London) landlords advertise higher prices than they expect, so you should try to haggle the price, say from £950 to £850. You will find that renting in UK is fairly organized, there are big and small agencies that manage the letting, in some cases you will never meet the landlord. http://www.rightmove.co.uk/ is great for finding a place to rent (indexing the agencies). I prefer http://www.zoopla.co.uk/ for looking at a place to buy, they do rental indexes as well.

You will have to decide if you want to rent furnished or not, both are fairly common, depending on market segments. I assume you might prefer furnished to start with, as you don't know how long you will stay, and probably don't want to bring sofas etc. across the Atlantic. As such you should probably fall into the big ""young professionals"" category and should have plenty of choice in London. You will need to research the areas, as the standard, crime levels varies a lot. Your future colleagues will probably be a good starting point.

If you're earning 62k, you could afford both a car and a bike for nice weather. The higher rate (40%) of tax starts at about 45k, but average earnings are about 26k IIRC (but probably more in london)

Renting is easy in a big city. Don't buy unless you're staying in the same place for at least 3-5 years. You'll find plenty of property rental web sites for prices and locations. Location is important in london - somewhere on the right tube or bus line for your office could save you a lot of commuting time. You will have to pay more for a parking space. There's also a 'congestion zone' in the centre, where you have to pay about £8 a day to drive a car. 

Insurance can be over £2000 for an 18 year old, or for a flash car, but if you're over 30 with a sensible car it should be under £500 - and it'll go down a lot if you have a few years with no claims. Try GoCompare.com or Confused.com for quotes.

england,comment,Israel Defense Forces,i3cibh1,Alone_Harel,,"Israel is one of the oldest countries in the world. It existed even before the Roman Empire and Christianity. Recently, the oldest remnant of its existence was found - a Hebrew curse from 3200 years ago.

The State of Israel was destroyed in Roman times. The Romans conquered Israel and after a revolt destroyed it. Their victory and the looting of the Temple is documented to this day on the Victory Gate.

Recently (1948) the State of Israel was re-established in the Land of Israel (its original location). Israel today is a Jewish-democratic state that promotes democratic values ​​under the guise of Jewish culture (such as Germany, Britain, Sweden, and others). Israel guarantees equal rights in its private literature. Israel gives autonomy to all religions within it and respects them, including the existence of religious courts designated for each religion (binding only in the matter of marriage) and a civil court. Israel holds a Jewish identity in its public book, its flag, anthem and emblem are based on Judaism as well as its national holidays. 

Israel is very well known because of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Palestinians claim that Israel has no right to exist at all, while Israel claims that it has a right to exist. Many support the Palestinian side in the belief that Jews, as an inferior human race, are unworthy of expressing their culture in an independent state.It is important to note: the Palestinian goal is not the establishment of a Palestinian state, they could have done that back in 1948. The Palestinian goal is not to have a Jewish state. Over the years, Israel has proposed 5 different peace agreements, each of which was conditional on the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside a Jewish state. All proposals were rejected by the Palestinian Authority.",2022-04-04T13:00:42+00:00

Since you can't have guns over there (and I'm sure this is just the tough guy American military sentiment coming out from the guys since I'm, personally, excited to live somewhere without guns), people are saying the self-defense laws are different and if people break into your house, you can only hit them below the belt, can't use a baseball bat, etc. Also, they are saying that areas like Brandon, Thetford, Mildenhall and Newmarket are dangerous places to live with home/car break-ins.

I don't know anyone who has lived in the area past being a tourist, and I'm not sure what resources are available to research laws like this. I also don't trust the random military grunts that are likely just being pro-American and ignorant who are telling us we're not going to be safe over there.

So - what do you think? What are your rights in a home-invasion (like if you were an American, defending your home with deadly force is generally acceptable, at least in many circumstances)? Do you know anything about these areas and can you confirm that they are bullshit/true?

I am just afraid of being taken advantage of by property management companies that get their money from American ignorance and want to ensure my own safety should my husband ever get deployed/leave. I will be alone over there and after much research I think the best understanding of my rights will come from people who actually live there.

Thank you for your help, it is much appreciated.",2011-09-20T05:36:40+00:00

* The chances of you getting broken into are incredibly slim

* The chance of any such intruder being armed are even slimmer - Aggravated Burglary (breaking into a house with a weapon) can be given a **life sentence**

* If someone breaks into your house and you grab a nearby weapon (knife, bat etc) and attack them you will generally be fine. There have been a couple of cases recently where burglars have been stabbed to death and the home-owner has been let off. A lot of the noise comes from the fact that they have been arrested first whilst the police investigate the circumstances. The rule is basically ""reasonable force"" - if you shoot someone in the back with a shotgun as they leave your property, you're in trouble. If you pursue the culprit down the street and stab them to death, you're in trouble. If you grab a bat from beside your bed and smack the guy over the head while he's in your house and he happens to die, you're pretty much in the clear.

* Worth repeating - the chances of you getting broken into are incredibly slim. The most recent murder rate per capita in England was 1.19 per 100,000 people. In the US it's 5.0.",2011-09-20T11:51:06+00:00

That may include a pre-emptive strike, one where you strike before they do. 

A breach of the peace isn't really relevant to the scenario, it could be but there are criminal offences as well so it is superseded. 

Section 3 of the Criminal law act states that a person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances to effect or assist the arrest of offenders or those unlawfully at large. (I have paraphrased here a bit) 

Section 24a of the Police and criminal evidence act states that a person other than a constable [anyone who isn't a police officer] may arrest any person without a warrant  if they are committing or they reasonably suspect that the person was committing an indictable offence.  (burglary is an indictable offence under sections 9(1)(a) and 9(1)(b) of the theft act. Exactly which section will depend on the exact circumstances) 

TL;DR; as far as the law is concerned as long as you use reasonable force in self defence you don't commit any offence.

In the short run both major parties are dominated by zionist lobbyists etc, and will do pretty much whatever Netanyahu tells them to. (Except that every president since GWB has refused to invade Iran when Netanyahu told them to.)

But what *should* we do?

I say. the USA should issue every Jewish Israel a US passport and let them come live here if they want to. No Israeli should be forced to stay in harm's way.

And all support for the Israeli nation should be stopped.

I say that when a nation thinks their choices are genocide or continual culling, never quite enough to call it genocide but never a better choice than killing a fraction of the ""enemy"" population every few years, the USA should try to avoid alliance with that nation.

Like a friend told me when I was starting to get involved with a problematic woman, ""Never take on a girlfriend who owns a dragon ranch.""

Israel has nothing much to offer the USA. They are on bad terms with most of their neighbors, though some are trying to tolerate them for our sake and because they are so dangerous.

They do not help us with our wars. They help us more by staying strictly apart from them.

There are some US supply dumps in Israel, and Israelis object that the US flag flies over them. They contain supplies that the Israelis can use if they need to, that we don't need to have there.

Their intelligence service does provide the USA with vital information. They were the ones who told us about 9/11 in time to stop it. They were the ones who told us that Iraq had no nuclear weapons program. When we invaded Iraq they gave us vital information about how to occupy an arab nation without much resistance and set up a peaceful democratic government. They were so competent that they predicted the October attack and prevented it.

They have been a big help to the USA in our nuclear nonproliferation program. If they had nuclear weapons, many other nations would be strongly tempted to get them too, particularly all their enemies. But they promised us that they would never be the first to introduce nuclear weapons to the middle east, and by keeping that promise they have helped us a lot.

Their effect on the UN has been entirely beneficial to us. Nobody could help us more there.

But apart from that they are a liability. It's true that the direct monetary aid we give them amounts to only about $500 per Jewish Israeli per year. Far less than we give our own welfare recipients. Only a quarter trillion dollars total so far. But when we give them our most advanced secret weapons and the plans that let them copy those weapons themselves, that amounts to a whole lot.

Maybe without our aid they would suffer significant casualities themselves, maybe even more than they dish out. So make sure that no Jewish Israeli has to live there. We don't owe it to them to make sure they can keep slaughtering people there, decade after decade.",2023-10-30T15:22:34+00:00

GreenParty,comment,Palestine,ditz8se,WikiTextBot,,"##Zionism
Zionism (Hebrew: צִיּוֹנוּת‎ Tsiyyonut IPA: [t͡sijo̞ˈnut] after Zion) is the national movement of the Jewish people that supports the re-establishment of a Jewish homeland in the territory defined as the historic Land of Israel (roughly corresponding to Canaan, the Holy Land, or the Roman-named region Palestine). Modern Zionism emerged in the late 19th century in Central and Eastern Europe as a national revival movement, in reaction to anti-Semitic and exclusionary nationalist movements in Europe. Soon after this, most leaders of the movement associated the main goal with creating the desired state in Palestine, then an area controlled by the Ottoman Empire.

Until 1948, the primary goals of Zionism were the re-establishment of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel, ingathering of the exiles, and liberation of Jews from the antisemitic discrimination and persecution that they experienced during their diaspora. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Zionism continues primarily to advocate on behalf of Israel and to address threats to its continued existence and security.

GreenParty,post,Israel-Palestine,17gis1i,Alarmed-Direction500,New to the party! I can’t vote for Biden again.,"My entire adult life I’ve registered independent, but always voted Democrat without hesitation. I’m definitely liberal leaning and I think protecting the environment needs to always be a top consideration when any decision is made. I’ve always loved the face value goals of the Green Party, but never fully committed because the presidential races have always felt very “good guy vs bad guy”. 

Hope this isn’t too controversial, but I’m appalled at the way Biden is blindly supporting Israel’s disproportionate and indiscriminate retaliation to Hamas, and by extension the people of Palestine. I cannot vote for Biden in good conscious. 

So, who is the green party’s 2024 presidential nominee? Is there an accurate and concise source for me to learn about the party’s position on the multitude of pressing issues in todays troubled world? What are the party’s general positions on topics like guns, abortions, police reform, lgbt rights, corporate tax reform, etc.?

Thanks in advance!",2023-10-25T23:41:02+00:00
GreenParty,comment,Israel-Palestine,k6h2xd9,TheGreenGarret,,">the presidential races have always felt very “good guy vs bad guy”.

Yes the duopoly loved presidential campaigns feeling that way because more people will vote for them rather than change. But I do think we're seeing major cracks and ""spoiler"" effect is having less impact on folks now that Biden is making it clear any differences Democrats had from Republicans are quickly disappearing.

>who is the green party’s 2024 presidential nominee?

None yet! The party follows a primary process just like any other party. The first primaries will occur sometime after the beginning of the year. The exact date depends on your state. I'd suggest contacting your state party for more information. See gp.org for more information.

>Is there an accurate and concise source for me to learn about the party’s position

The official party platform is at gp.org/platform which has all of the recent updates approved by the national committee. It's not very concise but it is separated by topics so you can scroll to the topic you want and read.

>What are the party’s general positions on topics like guns, abortions, police reform, lgbt rights, corporate tax reform

Read the platform for details but my summary would be:

Guns -- support basic reforms like background checks but also believe in self defense

Abortion -- unequivocally the party believes it is a right for the mother to choose healthcare including abortion

Police reform -- I believe the platform was updated to support 8 for abolition, the old platform was fairly weak and didn't say much

LGBTQ Rights -- yes full support for LGBTQ including trans rights. The party has a Lavender Caucus which represents LGBTQ members at the national level.

Corporate tax reform -- as part of the Green New Deal, there's a lot of tax changes that would happen but generally corporations pay more and families pay less, including establishing a negative income tax for low wages that would effectively create a universal basic income.

Speaking of, the Green New Deal was originally proposed over a decade ago by the Green Party, the platform was updated last year for a more comprehensive GND plan with a full budget proposal.",2023-10-26T00:42:06+00:00

GreenParty,post,Israel-Palestine,1b4ii1h,JohnJD1302,[Discussion/Rant] I'm increasingly seeing the Rochdale by-election as a HUGE miss for the Greens (England),"Since the Commons seat of Rochdale was vacated following the unfortunate death of Sir Tony Lloyd, the by-election campaign there would turn out to be one of the most chaotic political events of the year in Britain, tragically resulting in the return to Parliament of the grifter, transphobe, Hezbollah-supporter, antisemite, and overall vile human being, George Galloway.

Rochdale has a Muslim population of around 30%, so it was inevitable that Gaza would be a major contention of this campaign, and that a candidate who is vocal in stopping the plight of Palestinians would have a good chance of taking the seat.

George Galloway's posturing as an anti-war candidates hides the fact of his climate change denial, his transphobia, his previous endorsement of Tories, and the fact that he was endorsed by Nick Griffin, the neofascist BNP leader. His campaign has even been accused of send two completely different messages to Muslims and non-Muslims, with two separate campaign letters sent to voters containing completely contradictory messaging, one of them echoing Trump-style rhetoric. This by-election should not be celebrated by any true progressive.

Which is why I find it tragic that the local Greens there have failed to capitalize on the fact that the Labour candidate was suspended for their comments on Israel. The Greens could have put out a candidate who would be a true progressive voice against the far-right Israeli government and be a representative of Rochdale's Muslim community, and expose the toxicity of Galloway's politics, while at the same time, represent non-Muslims by catering to local kitchen table issues, much like the independent candidate David Tully who came second.

Instead, the candidate they put out has only alienated the Muslim community. Even if such comments they made were in the past, it was only right these comments has surfaced, as one cannot be too wary of the character of any individual trying to represent constituents.

This lost was also a HUGE miss. If only the Greens had won this by-election, imagine the massive PR win of the Greens defeating Galloway. Progressives would've flock to the party, a massive flow of donations would've come their way, be a more serious threat to Starmer, and it may not have been very hard to hold on to that seat in the next GE.


This by-election stall and MUST serve an incredibly important lesson for the Green Party of England and Wales, if we were to try to get more MPs to counter the increasingly blurred two-party system, of Sunak's disastrous Tory government, and Starmer's Tory Lite Labour. Greens must being in Green values and adapt them to fit the needs of people where they run. Improved vetting of candidates must also be done, and that we shall campaign harder and harder, TOGETHER with other like-minded progressives, to stop this stagnant two-party system, get Britain back, and stop its support of the far-right Israeli state, and champion a free Palestine.",2024-03-02T07:23:53+00:00

GreenParty,post,Israel-Palestine,d2qb89,dadoonan,"18 Years after 9/11, Unanswered Questions as War on Terrorism Continues","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kqfcbtp8xyl31.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6e40c7f43c6343903f3acd9ccfd10e23e0389fb

By Mark Dunlea

This year marks the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that killed more than 3,000.

9/11 was used as the justification for U S invasions in the Middle East and the war on terrorism. It was used to curtail civil liberties and suppress political dissent at home, and to further bankrupt our public treasury in order to pay for an ever expanding military industrial complex. Our government lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq[\[1\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn1) to invade a country which had no role in 9/11.

For the first decade after 9/11, I annually published an op ed in the Albany Times Union and elsewhere addressing “the unanswered” questions from 9/11 and the wrong policy responses adopted by our government (I did issue a 9/11 statement for the 2018 anniversary[\[2\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn2).)

Like many, I was traumatized by the murders, particularly watching the World Trade Center towers collapse over and over again with speculation that as many as 50,000 people might still be trapped inside. I am haunted by the images of people hurtling to their deaths, flying down the outside of the Tower to escape a worse fate inside

I was equally horrified that as the smoke rose from the WTC that politicians and the mainstream media rushed to bang the drums of war.  I am proud that within hours after the towers fell I issued a statement for the Green Party opposing the bipartisan rush to war. For one of the few moments in my lifetime the world was united in sympathy with America. We had the opportunity to use it to build a world more centered on peace and common good. America instead chose a different path.

9/11 became an excuse to unleash American military forces in pursuit of a global American empire in support of corporate globalization

One of the first casualties of war is the truth. It quickly became obvious that the “truth” about 9/11 was never going to come out.

Unlike the 9/11 Truth Movement, I was willing to accept the general narrative of the 9/11 Commission – that foreign terrorists hijacked 4 planes to kill as many people as possible. As someone who has worked with the government politicians and bureaucrats for over 40 years, I dismiss government conspiracies out of hand for being way beyond their competency to pull off.

The 9/11 Commission was an exercise in damage control to protect the reputation of our national leaders and of our foreign policy and intelligence community. The failure to ""connect the dots"" to prevent the terrorist attacks of 9/11 ranks among the worst intelligence failures in American history.[\[3\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn3) The official report blames this on bureaucratic competition and non-cooperation. I would more describe it – at a minimum - as criminal negligence. The Bush administration for instance for months after September 11th kept hidden from the American public the fact that they received prior warnings from other governments including Britain and Israel about possible terrorist attacks, including hijackings, by bin Laden and his associates.[\[4\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn4)

The first – and only – article that I wrote that went viral was my outrage that President Bush wanted Henry Kissinger to head up the commission. Kissinger was the architect of the 9/11 terrorist attack three decades prior– the overthrow and murder of President Allende in Chile[\[5\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn5). I documented not only Kissinger’s role in promoting terrorism but the rampant conflicts of interests among the other foreign intelligence members that dominated the Commission. Kissinger withdrew a few days after my article appeared – though largely because he did not want to disclose his rogue gallery of clients.

The two co-chairs of the Commission - Tom Keane, former Republican Governor of NJ and Democrat Lee Hamilton - later wrote a book where they outlined two main lies from the Commission’s investigation. (They also wrote in the NY Times about how the CIA undercut the investigation by destroying potential evidence.[\[6\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn6)) The first lie was that the prime motivation for the hijackers was the US role in supporting Israel against Palestine, not the fact that the US had built air bases in Saudi Arabia. However, the more critical lie led them to initially wanting the Pentagon generals to be tried for perjury.

The generals lied to the Commission (and Congress and the public) in denying that the NORAD air command was running an exercise the morning of 9/11 involving faked hijacked airplanes[\[7\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn7). Vanity Fair won litigation to publish NORAD’s transcripts from that morning as the air controllers pleaded to take the fake airplanes off the screen so they could figure out how to direct the Air Force to respond to the real hijackers.[\[8\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn8)

What has not been answered is why did the General’s repeatedly lie about this? If I was the mastermind of 9/11 and knew that the US was going to run an exercise with faked hijacked airplanes, you can bet that would be the day I would choose to launch my own attack.  So how did the hijackers learn about the training exercise (and other information like Logan airport in Boston[\[9\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn9) having probably the worst security in the country)?

9/11 Truthers point out that the neocons in the government (i.e., Cheney and Rumsfeld) openly wrote about the need for a “Pearl Harbor” event[\[10\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn10) to provide a pretext to invade Iraq to seize its oil. Other possibilities include someone providing the info for money or blackmail. Or was the intelligence community so incompetent that foreign opponents could figure it out?

Or was this information provided to some foreign allies that then leaked it to the 9/11 terrorists? Two possibilities are Saudi Arabia, one of the most oppressive and brutal regimes on the planet[\[11\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn11), and/or  ISI[\[12\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn12) (Inter-services Intelligence), the powerful Pakistani version of the CIA and FBI that often seems to operate independently of the civilian elected officials

There has been much speculation about the role of Saudi Arabia in the attacks. 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis (not Iraqis). Only recently were the “missing pages” about Saudi Arabia possible ties to the hijackers from the 9/11 report released[\[13\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn13).

One issue is the role of the Saudi ruling family in funding Al Qaeda[\[14\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn14). Many believe that the Saudi’s provide funding to such terrorists as protection money. Go ahead and take your fight against the infidels, fight Israel and their allies, just make sure you don’t engage in such activities in the Kingdom itself.

The 9/11 report was unable to document who funded the 9/11 attacks. They said however that the actual source of funding was not important since the $500,000 estimated cost could have come from Al Qaeda’s petty cash as part of its estimated annual $30 million budget.[\[15\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn15)

While the Commission felt documenting the 9/11 money trail was not important, the federal government allegedly felt that “terrorism financing” was so critical that they launched a sting operation in Albany to entrap a pizza store owner and his witnessing Imam. While even the local mainstream media quickly decided the sting operation was bogus[\[16\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn16), Araf and Hussein were sentenced to decades in prison. Meanwhile, the operative who organized the sting[\[17\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn17) to escape prosecution for selling false identifies went on to become the owner of the limousine in which 20 individuals recently died in Schoharie. [\[18\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn18)

Bin Laden comes from a prominent family whose construction firm was the builder of choice for the Saudi regime[\[19\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn19). There are reports that the Bush and Clinton administration restricted the ability of the intelligence community to go after bin Laden and other Saudis out of the desire to maintain our “special relationship” with the Saudi oil wealth[\[20\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn20). This was not something addressed in depth by the 9/11 Commission.

Nor was the possible central role of the ISI addressed by the 9/11 Commission. The ISI have been closely aligned with the Taliban and al Qaeda. There were mainstream reports by media outlets including CBS that the ISI wired $100,000 to the lead hijacker shortly before the attack[\[21\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn21). In Angelina Jolie’s movie Mighty Heart about Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street journalist who was murdered while investigating the relationship between the ISI and Al Qaeda, a key moment is when she discovers that the person they think killed her husband is the ISI operative who wired the funds to the hijackers[\[22\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn22). If true (something the 9/11 Commission should have investigated), one question would be whether the money was just part of the ISI’s possible ongoing payments to Al Qaeda or that they knew it was going to support the hijacking. 

Another issue not addressed is how the US – starting under President Carter and continued by Reagan – created the conditions that allowed the Al Qaeda training camps to operate in Afghanistan. It was a classic case of blowback.

In 1979, Carter began to fund the Afghanistan warlords (terrorists) in their efforts to overthrow the central government that was closely aligned with the Soviet government.[\[23\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn23) This government strongly supported women’s rights. The US was interested in drawing the Soviets into their own version of Vietnam on their southern border, with the Soviets worried about their own internal struggles with Muslim dissidents.

Bin Laden was part of the Saudi contingent that came to Afghanistan to fight the Soviets. Bin Laden’s role was to provide financing from his family’s wealth. He was apparently more reasonable / easier to deal with than the mujahedeen, so the CIA established a working relationship with him.[\[24\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn24) The country became chaotic following the collapse of the central government, with the various warlords and their ever-shifting allegiances controlling their own territories. To stabilize the situation, the Pakistani ISI (possibly along with the CIA) encouraged their allies the Taliban to migrate over the border into Afghanistan to “take control”[\[25\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn25). At some point the Taliban struck a deal to allow bin Laden and others to operate their training camps in exchange for providing support in the fight against the Northern Alliance warlords.[\[26\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn26) (Note this is an abbreviated and simplified version.)

One of the most incredulous parts of the 9/11 Commission report – which the report itself admits defies belief – is how the lead hijackers were recruited. It reads like a bad Saturday Night Live skit. (Others have provided a far different narrative[\[27\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn27).) The source of this information, alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, is supposed to finally to go to trial eighteen years after his capture.[\[28\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn28)(His nephew led the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.[\[29\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn29)) It will be interesting to see if any new information emerges.

After 9/11 most of us pledged to “never forget” and seek justice for the victims. Instead, our government has inflicted vengeance which has killed hundreds of thousands of individuals who had no role in 9/11 while only bin Laden was held “accountable” (without a public trial that might have answered more questions). The use of terrorism and violence against civilians has continued to increase. Those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it.  Increasingly the greatest threat to our national security is climate change[\[30\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn30), not terrorism.

GreenParty,comment,Gaza,k7swnk7,Double-Fun-1526,,"""(GPAX) urges that the party participate in the wave of worldwide mass protests against the US-Israeli slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza and elsewhere.

Our main concern is US military and diplomatic participation in the war and in the criminal siege and bombardment that have already killed thousands in Gaza, wounded tens of thousands, and left a million homeless.

GPAX calls for ending the supply of weapons and financing to Israel; withdrawing US military assets from the region; and ending US war threats. The U.S. must also become constructively engaged in diplomatic efforts to resolve this persistent threat to world peace.

We support the widespread calls by UN officials and member countries, trade unionists, and others for a ceasefire, provision of humanitarian aid, the release of detained people, and long-term solutions based on justice and equality. We urge the Green Party and state parties to work with others for all these goals.

We believe that the recent meeting of President Joe Biden with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, combined with US unconditional support for the Israelis, will inflame the region even further. Without taking the steps we propose, the death and destruction will continue. Our goal is peace, but a peace accompanied by justice for all people of this region.""


Very well said. 

Israel needs to be a viable and safe state. (Whether we should've allowed this 100 years ago is another question,  but it is here). We should help then achieve that. I have no problem guaranteeing their general safety.

There should have been global condemnation of the  slow and deliberate encroachment onto disputed land. If israel is incapable of reaching a hand out and fixing this situation, then the rest of the world should have demanded it through sanctions. Instead, there was endless appeasement. When various groups created the BDS movement, a boycott harshly criticizing isaeli policy, they were essentially shouted down. Now, the world understands why the situation is absurd. And horrors are now following on both sides.

We must rethink US foreign policy across the board.

Consider the possibility that the USA should grant every Jewish Israeli a US passport and green card.

Many Israelis have nowhere to go. Some of them came to Israel from arab countries where Zionist actions and arab responses made them feel particularly unwelcome. 

Some of them came from Russia. When the USSR let Jews leave, Israel insisted that the USA not accept too many of them, wanting many to have no choice but to come to Israel.

No Jewish Israelis should be stuck living in Israel if they don't want to. The more of them that come to live in safety in the USA, the better off they will be. Israel does not have nearly enough water for 7 million Jewish Israelis, much less an extra 10% for Israel arabs and palestinians.

GreenParty,post,West Bank,63ulzp,BorisMalden,Do you have to be a liberal to support green policies?,"I am passionate about many green policies and place sustainability at the heart of my political beliefs. We (in the west) appear to live in a society completely dominated by laissez-faire capitalism; banks and big business dominate politics and media and have rigged the system in their favour. The profit motive (which does not seem to trickle past the c-suite at all) is not only very bad for the vast majority of citizens, but is also destroying our environment. I believe radical change is needed if humanity is going to thrive.

However, when I look at the green parties around the world I see lots of liberal policies that I completely oppose. Take for example the contentious issue of immigration. Most liberals in my country support a laissez-faire, almost borderless immigration, without seeming to be too concerned about the environmental impact. We have hundreds of thousands of people entering the country each year, and no one on the left seems to be too worried about the fact that this is completely unsustainable - more and more green space is disappearing each year. I would support heavy control on immigration so that net migration is not much different to 0 - I know that's typically regarded as a right-wing view.

That's just one reason why I can't identify with liberals, though there are plenty more. I don't think that makes me any less of a Green though. So what do you think? Is there room in the Green Party for people who have anti-liberal views?",2017-04-06T17:57:36+00:00

It drives down wages and gives relief to the worst kinds of exploitative bosses who profit from a captive workforce unable to take legal action against their employers.",2017-04-07T21:31:40+00:00

I think we all share some core beliefs.  Environmental rights, human rights, voter rights, restrictions on corporate over-reach, government transparency, non-militarism, privacy rights...

These are important issues, but we have to find a way to pull in earnest moderate conservatives and libertarians without compromising our core beliefs or we'll sit and watch our issues get farther and farther from reality.

But the one group we need to cut loose of is the corporate 3rd way Clinton liberals.  They're whole purpose is to co-opt the progressives and disarm us, in service of their corporate pay masters.

**The March for Fossil Fuel Freedom: A 34-mile walk to Expose Oily Wells**

Wells Fargo Bank has a dirty-energy secret: it's a leading lender to the fossil-fuel industry. That's why a coalition of supporters - including Santa Clara County Green Party - is participating in a campaign targeting San Francisco-based ""Oily Wells"" and marching 34 miles, from Palo Alto to San Francisco.

Join the Santa Clara Greens as we host the first stagecoach stop!

GreenParty,post,West Bank,5b5c4r,SymbioticPatriotic,Be a Stein-Baraka / Green Party Activist at the State Level,"We are going into the final weekend, and the r/jillstein boards are becoming swamped with activity and postings. 

To help out those who want to be active over the final weekend in their own state, there are now sub-Reddits for Jill Stein that have been established at the state level for every state containing the most popular posts (articles, polls, texts) from r/jillstein have been cross-linked to those pages. 

Every state board contains a sticky post at the top that gives you a list of ways you can be an activist for Stein-Baraka in your state.

Here`is how you can get become an activist at the state level:

1. Subscribe to the Jill Stein board for your state. Read the link on How to Help the Stein/Baraka Ticket in Your State for local ideas.

2. Look at the content that is posted there, and upvote as you feel appropriate. If you feel there is additional things to say - articles, pictures, Youtubes, memes - feel free to post it there. You are also welcome to place links about local or state Green Party candidates and their campaign news and activities. Be sure to check out the Other Discussions in the comment field, and if you liked the story, upvote it on all the other sites it appears across Reddit.

3. Use the content links to share stories about Jill and Ajamu with your neighbors on the state, county and city Reddits. The Stein-Baraka campaign have lacked coverage by the MSM, so you can help spread the message by posting a state-based article in your hometown. And contribute a comment to your article on why you feel Jill and Ajamu are the only choice this Tuesday.

4. Use the board as a place to link up with activists in your state for activities (phone-banking, getting out the vote, flyering, tabling, canvassing, demostrating against DAPL, whatever). 

Soon, I will be publishing an updated state-by-state poll of where the Stein-Baraka campaign stands nationally, and we are doing better than the RealPolitics averages would have you believe. We have been gaining over the past week day-by-day, and going into this final weekend, the 5% threshold is within our grasp if we work hard over the next five days.

GreenParty,post,West Bank,y0uf3,timesofgrace,"You guys do realize that local candidates rely on the strength of national candidates, right? A successful party can't do one or the other, it has to do both simultaneously.","There were a couple posts that had sentiments I totally disagreed with. Mainly about the ineptitude of the party and the irrelevance of a presidential campaign that can't be won. There was so much truthiness going on in the comments section in a couple threads, I could not express my thoughts one by one, so I wanted to give my thoughts here:

*""Jill Stein won't win."" *

Thank you, that is very insightful!

Now, if this is important to you (to some of us, it is not) what are you going to do about it? Besides complain? 

This is a democracy; in democracies you have to get up, fight, and make your voice heard. If no one listens, you may have to yell louder, or get arrested at a bank protest. In some cases, people will only listen to you because someone on your presidential ticket appeals to them.

Many never would have heard of the Green Party if it weren't for Jill Stein. 

The reason a lot of local Green elected officials (yes, they exist contrary to the assumptions of most. Here's Maddow interviewing one: http://www.darylnorthrop.com/blog/2011/6/26/mayor-jason-west-g-on-rachel-maddow.html) get any exposure at all is because they are linked to the Presidential candidates.

In other words, you can't get exposure to local candidates unless they piggyback off a strong national candidate. It's like a sacrifice fly in baseball; it looks bad on the stats sheet, but it's what's best for the whole team. If you look at the 2008 election and how excitement for Obama carried over to lesser known local candidates, you can see how this dynamic works.


Also, turnout for presidential elections is much higher than midterms. 

That's because voters want to support their presidential candidate, and if there is none, many people will stay home. That will absolutely KILL turnout for the local candidates. Again, presidential candidtates are critical for turnout.

So to say ""Stein is wasting her time, focus on local elections"" is a profoundly misinformed strategy. 

The only reason we are having this discussion about local candidates is because Dr. Stein is such a strong national candidate who has brought attention to potential victories local races. McKinney and Cobb were never as strong as her.

And yes, the Greens are already running for school board, city council, county council, and mayor (http://www.greenpartywatch.org/2012/03/15/56-green-candidates-campaigning-for-office-in-texas/). The question is, are you supporting your Green school board, city council, county council, or mayoral candidates? Do you even know who they are? Do you have Google? How are you helping them?


How can a local candidate get federally matched funds? Do you realize that Stein's matching funds are being used for local ballot access goals? The local candidates wouldn't even be on the ballot in states like PA if it weren't for resources from the national presidential campaign being funnelled for local use.


This is not an easy thing to do. How many states does the supposedly more ""experienced"" Rocky Anderson have ballot access in? With all her fame and connections, how could Barr not raise enough money for federal matching funds? How could an unknown doctor beat a multimillionaire Hollywood actress? This is a lot more complicated than you guys think... Obama has more campaign offices in Stein's neighborhood than she has employees on her entire staff; the reason for this is corporate money, not ineptitude.



I hate to break it to you guys, but if you are voting because you want to win, rather than doing what is right, you are in the wrong place. 

A vote for Greens is a vote for resistance. 

It is a vote for ""none of the above."" 

It is a vote for obstructing the status quo of the corporate state. 

It is a vote for raising awareness that there is another way.

Getting elected to the CEO position of the United Corporations of America is not the goal here. 

Your vote is a protest vote. 

I have never heard of an anti-war protester or an Occupier who said ""We've been out here all day, and the the war isn't over yet & we haven't won anything. Let's go home and vote for Obama because he will win."" 

This is the mentality of paralysis. This mentality would have killed just about every successful socio-political movement from day one.


Not voting, or a vote for a corporate Democrat, is a signal that you are ok with the status quo; that what is going on is not a big enough deal for you to spend the time to vote. 

If you think that making your voice heard is a waste of time, I don't know what to tell you. I guess you should stay home & watch reality TV. Or better yet, watch live coverage of the election where the rest of the country decides your fate without you.


**TL;DR**

*Presidential campaigns get local candidates on the ballot, raise money for them, funnel national resources to them, and get local candidates media attention. Voters mainly turn out for presidential votint, which coattail off to local candidates, not the other way around. Do you even know who your local candidates are?*

*Voting Green for president has other goals besides being in charge of a corrupt government. It is mainly about resistance and protest, but also it helps in getting local candidates elected. Voting for a Democrat or not voting at all has the same result, which is getting more of what you already hate.*

GreenParty,comment,West Bank,c5rbifh,vwboyaf1,,"Seeing how I am the guy raising a lot of the fuss, I think I owe you a response.  

I understand that the Green Party has a proud history of integrity, protest, and standing up for what is right no matter what.  I appreciate that, and judging from the 10 Key Values, the Green Party seems like the party I want representing me.  

Here is the problem.  The Green Party, from what I gather in your comments, is not interested in actually representing anybody as a governing power.  You talk about being a resistance, a vote for ""none of the above"", and that getting elected to ""CEO position of the United Corporations of America in not the goal here"".  How insulting to the the American voter.  

We have been doing this for 12 years with very minimal success, and now I believe it is time to start taking this a little more seriously.  It is time to come up with a real strategy to win elections and start representing people.  People have put in a lot of money, volunteer time, and their reputations on the line to help this party.  What is there to show for it.  I see no Green Party rep sitting higher than selectperson anywhere in government.  

You say that having a national candidate helps the local elections through fundraising and awareness.  I think the the strategy is completely backwards.  The Green Party is proud of her grassroots campaigning, but yet, shoots for the ultimate goal before even winning a single seat in any congress, state or national.  How is Jill Stein even supposed to get anything done once she is President if she doesn't  have a single friend in Congress, besides Bernie Sanders?

People seem confused about the term ""geographical base"" this does not mean having a headquarters set up in a state; it means consistently winning in that state or region.  It means focusing effort on finding elections that are ripe for the taking and going after them with a bit of aggressiveness.  This is politics, the goal is to get elected and become productive from within the government, not shout at it from the doorway.   

So, in the end, the American voters are only going to vote for a party that is really in it to win, to gain power, and to represent them in government.  If we are only in it to shift the conversation, or be a thorn in the side of the Dems, most voters will never take us seriously.  

Currently, I am unable to volunteer to help the GP in Vermont because I'm currently overseas.  Once I return, you can believe me that I will become active in whatever region I decide to live in.

GreenParty,comment,West Bank,c5rcoch,timesofgrace,,"> The Green Party, from what I gather in your comments, is not interested in actually representing anybody as a governing power. 

No, that is not true at all. I never said that. I said the opposite, that the goal is to get local candidates elected. I even gave you a video link to an elected Green mayor who was interviewed by Rachel Maddow. Google Gayle McLaughlin. Ever heard of [Pam Hartwell-Herrero](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIUou6SH4xs&playnext=1&list=PL04693CB86E54BA73&feature=results_video&noredirect=1)? Saying that there are candidates who aren't serious about getting elected locally is false. I really don't know where this perception is coming from. 

Bernie Sanders started out as a mayor, and it took *decades* before he made it to the senate.

Building a party infrastructure takes DECADES, not a few election cycles. 10 years is nothing. That is only 2 election cycles. The Republican party is 15 times that old, and they are the *youngest* of the two legacy parties.

The point is that many people have no idea what it takes to get a political party established. People have no idea how alternative parties function, how they apply pressure to the 2 party system, and how they can achieve goals without winning the White House. The Libertarian platform has subsumed the GOP, and they have won nothing. If anything, the Greens have been more successful than them, but Libs are the ones who got their anti-govt policies enacted, which started with David Koch being their VP nominee in the 70s; again, it took decades of work to get his policies enacted.

I say this as someone who used to think *exactly* like you. You are no different than I was. I was guilty of all these thoughts: 

""They aren't serious""

""They don't know what they are doing""

""This is taking too long""

""I can do better than this""

etc.

You should go to a local GP meeting and tell them your bright ideas. See what they tell you. Chances are, you'll hear the same things I heard when I tried to impress them with my ""brilliance:""

""No shit, Sherlock.""

""Golly gee, run for local office? Wow, we never thought of THAT before!""

""Buy campaign ads! What a great idea?! We NEVER thought of that! So do you have $15 million dollars to buy air time?""

""Outreach to unions and environmental groups doesn't work, they won't return our calls.""

""Outreach to college students isn't as fruitful as you think because they don't turn out to vote, and many students are from out of state anyway""

""We don't have much cash on hand because we need the money for suing the government just to stay on the ballot""

""We don't have time to do X, Y, & Z because we have to collect 20,000 signatures just to stay on the ballot""

etc.

There is a lot going on behind the scenes that you have no idea about. If you knew about some of this stuff, you'd be forced to admit that it's a small miracle that this party still exists in this country.

But again, the strategy *is* to elect local candidates. That is the entire point, and from there you can move up into congress, like Sanders. That's why the GP is made up of small local organizations, and is not ruled by a big national party. 

But to say the local candidates can't benefit from a popular nationwide candidate is false. Again, look what the congressional Dems did in 2008 with Obama, and look what happened to Dems in 2010 when Obama was widely seen as a disappointment.

I just get frustrated that people don't see the big picture. They only see the presidential campaigns. They are oblivious to the fact that this is a multi-decade process, and that successful organizing takes years. They don't understand the process of building a base slowly; if it grows too fast, it becomes a fad and will collapse and fizzle like Occupy did. You can't just have an inside game, you need to have an inside/outside game.

I also get frustrated when people ignore candidates running for local office in their districts, then get up and complain about how candidates aren't running for local office, when they are! They just haven't done the research.

GreenParty,post,Hamas,17gis1i,Alarmed-Direction500,New to the party! I can’t vote for Biden again.,"My entire adult life I’ve registered independent, but always voted Democrat without hesitation. I’m definitely liberal leaning and I think protecting the environment needs to always be a top consideration when any decision is made. I’ve always loved the face value goals of the Green Party, but never fully committed because the presidential races have always felt very “good guy vs bad guy”. 

Hope this isn’t too controversial, but I’m appalled at the way Biden is blindly supporting Israel’s disproportionate and indiscriminate retaliation to Hamas, and by extension the people of Palestine. I cannot vote for Biden in good conscious. 

So, who is the green party’s 2024 presidential nominee? Is there an accurate and concise source for me to learn about the party’s position on the multitude of pressing issues in todays troubled world? What are the party’s general positions on topics like guns, abortions, police reform, lgbt rights, corporate tax reform, etc.?

Thanks in advance!",2023-10-25T23:41:02+00:00
GreenParty,comment,Hamas,k6h2xd9,TheGreenGarret,,">the presidential races have always felt very “good guy vs bad guy”.

Yes the duopoly loved presidential campaigns feeling that way because more people will vote for them rather than change. But I do think we're seeing major cracks and ""spoiler"" effect is having less impact on folks now that Biden is making it clear any differences Democrats had from Republicans are quickly disappearing.

>who is the green party’s 2024 presidential nominee?

None yet! The party follows a primary process just like any other party. The first primaries will occur sometime after the beginning of the year. The exact date depends on your state. I'd suggest contacting your state party for more information. See gp.org for more information.

>Is there an accurate and concise source for me to learn about the party’s position

The official party platform is at gp.org/platform which has all of the recent updates approved by the national committee. It's not very concise but it is separated by topics so you can scroll to the topic you want and read.

>What are the party’s general positions on topics like guns, abortions, police reform, lgbt rights, corporate tax reform

Read the platform for details but my summary would be:

Guns -- support basic reforms like background checks but also believe in self defense

Abortion -- unequivocally the party believes it is a right for the mother to choose healthcare including abortion

Police reform -- I believe the platform was updated to support 8 for abolition, the old platform was fairly weak and didn't say much

LGBTQ Rights -- yes full support for LGBTQ including trans rights. The party has a Lavender Caucus which represents LGBTQ members at the national level.

Corporate tax reform -- as part of the Green New Deal, there's a lot of tax changes that would happen but generally corporations pay more and families pay less, including establishing a negative income tax for low wages that would effectively create a universal basic income.

Speaking of, the Green New Deal was originally proposed over a decade ago by the Green Party, the platform was updated last year for a more comprehensive GND plan with a full budget proposal.",2023-10-26T00:42:06+00:00

Our main concern is US military and diplomatic participation in the war and in the criminal siege and bombardment that have already killed thousands in Gaza, wounded tens of thousands, and left a million homeless.

GPAX calls for ending the supply of weapons and financing to Israel; withdrawing US military assets from the region; and ending US war threats. The U.S. must also become constructively engaged in diplomatic efforts to resolve this persistent threat to world peace.

We support the widespread calls by UN officials and member countries, trade unionists, and others for a ceasefire, provision of humanitarian aid, the release of detained people, and long-term solutions based on justice and equality. We urge the Green Party and state parties to work with others for all these goals.

We believe that the recent meeting of President Joe Biden with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, combined with US unconditional support for the Israelis, will inflame the region even further. Without taking the steps we propose, the death and destruction will continue. Our goal is peace, but a peace accompanied by justice for all people of this region.""


Very well said. 

Israel needs to be a viable and safe state. (Whether we should've allowed this 100 years ago is another question,  but it is here). We should help then achieve that. I have no problem guaranteeing their general safety.

There should have been global condemnation of the  slow and deliberate encroachment onto disputed land. If israel is incapable of reaching a hand out and fixing this situation, then the rest of the world should have demanded it through sanctions. Instead, there was endless appeasement. When various groups created the BDS movement, a boycott harshly criticizing isaeli policy, they were essentially shouted down. Now, the world understands why the situation is absurd. And horrors are now following on both sides.

We must rethink US foreign policy across the board.

Consider the possibility that the USA should grant every Jewish Israeli a US passport and green card.

Many Israelis have nowhere to go. Some of them came to Israel from arab countries where Zionist actions and arab responses made them feel particularly unwelcome. 

Some of them came from Russia. When the USSR let Jews leave, Israel insisted that the USA not accept too many of them, wanting many to have no choice but to come to Israel.

No Jewish Israelis should be stuck living in Israel if they don't want to. The more of them that come to live in safety in the USA, the better off they will be. Israel does not have nearly enough water for 7 million Jewish Israelis, much less an extra 10% for Israel arabs and palestinians.

[The Green Party](https://www.gp.org/) observes the 39th anniversary of the United Nations International Day of Peace on September 21 by affirming support for the [UN General Assembly Resolution 36/37](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/gpus/pages/11173/attachments/original/1600690545/UN-Year-of-Peace-resolution.pdf?1600690545) to “commit to peace above all difference.” The 1981 Resolution established the International Day of Peace with unanimous support.

Green Party leaders condemn the perpetual state of war launched, with bitter irony, on the 19th anniversary of the Day of Peace Resolution with the passage of the post-9/11[ Authorization for Use of Military](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2829/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22S.J.Res.+2%22%5D%7D&r=50&s=1) Force (AUMF). Green Leaders also emphasized the party’s [demand for the repeal of the AUMF](https://www.gp.org/democracy#demForeignPolicy), which has even greater urgency with the global crises of COVID-19 and climate disruption.

“It is shameful that in May the US was the sole UN Security Council veto of the proposed global ceasefire in order to cooperate to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is a far greater threat to Americans than any force the US is fighting in its endless wars. The US ruling class would rather make war than heal the sick. So the US leads the world in deaths from COVID-19 at home and deaths in its foreign wars abroad. Those are terrible facts to recognize on the UN’s International Day of Peace.""

[**Madelyn Hoffman**](https://www.hoffmanforsenate.com/)**, Green Party Candidate for US Senate (NJ), and Co-Chair of the Green Party’s Peace Action Committee (GPAX):**

“The ramifications of war and preparation for war echo in every corner of human society in our country and abroad with devastating effects. It is time to end the horrible atrocities and unacceptable costs inflicted on humanity by the perpetuation of endless war.”

[**Lisa Savage**](https://www.lisaformaine.org/)**, Green Party Candidate US Senate (ME):**

“Our nation has become a military empire exporting violence and weaponry around the world while imposing austerity at home to pay for it. I call for an immediate end to US wars of aggression, occupations, and military bases in other people's countries. Let's bring the war dollars home and take care of our own urgent needs during this pandemic: Medicare for All universal single-payer improved and expanded health care, and a demilitarized Green New Deal to address the climate emergency that is our biggest security threat. As global citizens, let's not fight each other for resources but instead cooperate with one another to develop a response to the immediate threat of the COVID-19 virus.”

This year’s Peace Day theme is “Shaping Peace Together,” with the emphasis on working together globally to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this year,[ United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called for an immediate global ceasefire](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-03-23/secretary-generals-appeal-for-global-ceasefire), saying, “End the sickness of war and fight the disease that is ravaging our world. . . That is what our human family needs . . .” His call for “solidarity across borders” is consistent with the Green Party’s belief that peace, environmental responsibility and health are intimately connected. Anyone who now denies we are one interdependent human species across borders on mother earth is not in tune to the unprecedented moment we share today.

According to the GPAX[ World Peace Action platform](https://gpus.org/committees/peace-action/the-green-partys-world-peace-platform/): “Despite the United Nations call for a [global ceasefire](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1059972) during the Covid-19 world-wide pandemic, our government has instead deployed [20,000 troops to Europe](https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/04/trump-sending-20-000-troops-to-train-with-europeans-on-russian-border) to encircle Russia, and has sent warships to threaten [Venezuela](https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/04/07/trump-sends-gun-boats-to-venezuela-while-the-world-partners-to-fight-a-deadly-pandemic/), [Iran](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/04/22/trump-tweets-that-hes-instructed-the-navy-to-destroy-any-iranian-gunboats-that-harass-us-warships/), and [China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/world/asia/coronavirus-south-china-sea-warships.html). … Further, our country’s interventions in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East have left us mired in endless wars that have [weakened our country’s economic vitality](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/) and [decreased opportunities for our children](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/12/09/staggering-new-data-shows-income-top-1-has-grown-100-times-faster-bottom-50-1970).”

The Green Party’s Peace Action Committee has issued a[ Peace Pledge](https://gpax.gpus.org/peace-pledges/candidates-for-state-and-local-offices/) which they encourage all candidates for state and local office to sign. 

“We have the opportunity while being forced to adapt to a pandemic to reflect on the very real opportunities to end our unsustainable way of life,” said **Susan Lamont** of the Green Party of California. “Let’s use this opportunity to rethink the ways in which we interact as people and as nations.”  She added that the Green party of California [platform](http://www.cagreens.org/platform/peace-non-violence) “advocates a fundamental change in the way we socialize our citizens, structure our institutions, and relate to the planet and its people.” On this 2020 International Day of Peace, we remind people loudly and clearly that “peace is not just the absence of violence, it is a willingness to resolve conflict in a constructive manner with a spirit of good will and respect.” [http://www.cagreens.org/platform/peace-non-violence](http://www.cagreens.org/platform/peace-non-violence)

The war is just senseless slaughter of the process of the proletariat. Arming Ukraine won't stop that.

GreenParty,comment,Ceasefire,kus71nl,jethomas5,,"We have several opposing goals, and we can't expect to just go by one ideology to decide what to do for every occasion.

So for example we have an obligation to overthrow dictatorships anywhere in the world and replace them with democracies, as we did in Iraq. It's wrong for us to allow foreign dictators to dominate their people, since we are strong enough to beat their armies and hang their dictators.

And when a foreign nation has a popular consensus that they want to be an empire and dominate other nations,  we have an obligation to fight them and keep them from doing that, anywhere in the world. If we don't do it, one of them will get big enough and strong enough to dominate the world, and we can't allow that.

Putin is a dictator and his people want the Russian empire to dominate the world, and it turns out they are far stronger than we thought they were even a year ago. When it turns out that the only way to stop them is with a nuclear war that kills everybody in the world, don't we have an obligation to do that?

On the other hand, we are also dedicated to peace. What if the Russians will settle for not being too dominated by NATO? What if they are willing to settle for a slice of eastern Ukraine that doesn't include much fossil fuel? Perhaps we can wait and see what they're really willing to settle for, without deciding ahead of time that the only way to stop them is by killing enough of them to get an unconditional surrender.

I personally believe that we are limited by reality, whatever we want. The way we are running our economy now, cannot continue. We depend too much on fossil fuel. Fracking lets us suck out the last dregs quicker, which brings us closer to a sudden crisis. We depend too much on highly mechanized farming, which uses fossil fuel to create nitrogen fertilizer and on fossil fuel to quickly mine the last phosphates, and fossil fuel to create insecticides and herbicides, and fossil fuel to move frozen or refrigerated food long distances. Our banking system is a nightmare. Etc. We are heading for a restriction in resources, precisely when we need to use a lot of resources to organize reforms. 

We can't afford to keep dominating the whole world. We \*have\* to reduce our military expenses, and repurpose many of our engineers to peaceful technology. When we get past the tough times then we can think about whether to go back to dominating the world again. 

If we have to get into a world war while we're retooling, then we'll suffer. But if we get into a world war before we retool we'll suffer worse. So we must do the best we can.",2024-03-14T03:09:47+00:00

They have succeeded in dragging this country to the extreme right thanks to the support of ultra-greedy corporatists who are brainwashing the masses with phony think-tanks like the Cato Institute.  

The Libertarians won 4.5 million votes in 2016. That's more than the gap between Trump and Hillary.  More Americans voted Libertarian and Republican than voted Democrat and Green. This is the political reality that everyone is ignoring. Republicans are chasing libertarian votes and Democrats are chasing Republican votes. But no one is chasing leftist votes. 

The Libertarians are dragging this country to the right.  They are proof that a third-party can succeed even if it doesn't win the election. Public services have been gutted in this country because of the poisonous ideology of the Libertarians. 

This is why everyone needs to vote for the Green Party. The Libertarian Party gets votes and gets the policies that it wants.  Most Americans are leftists but don't vote because they are told over and over again that the Green Party is a waste of time.  We need to break this cycle. Tell nonvoters that their vote matters: a vote for the Green Party will bring this country back from the brink of a libertarian hellscape and provide essential public services to take care of all people no matter how much money they make or what connections they have.

Similarly, the electoral college isn't necessarily a problem. That same plurality of 35%, if it occured in every state, is good for a sweep of 536 of 538 electors, all but two states being winner take all. Of course, they don't need to do this, they just need a plurality in enough states for 270 electors.

Public funding is broken and no one takes it. Would be nice if Biden fixed it, but I would need to see it to believe it. Would he lower the threshold for third parties to obtain it though?

Zionism (Hebrew: צִיּוֹנוּת‎ Tsiyyonut IPA: [t͡sijo̞ˈnut] after Zion) is the national movement of the Jewish people that supports the re-establishment of a Jewish homeland in the territory defined as the historic Land of Israel (roughly corresponding to Canaan, the Holy Land, or the Roman-named region Palestine). Modern Zionism emerged in the late 19th century in Central and Eastern Europe as a national revival movement, in reaction to anti-Semitic and exclusionary nationalist movements in Europe. Soon after this, most leaders of the movement associated the main goal with creating the desired state in Palestine, then an area controlled by the Ottoman Empire.

Until 1948, the primary goals of Zionism were the re-establishment of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel, ingathering of the exiles, and liberation of Jews from the antisemitic discrimination and persecution that they experienced during their diaspora. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Zionism continues primarily to advocate on behalf of Israel and to address threats to its continued existence and security.

NEW: Frito-Lay workers in Kansas are being forced to work 12-hour days, 7 days a week, in a dangerous factory. Their stories are shocking. 

Now nearly 600 workers have gone on strike in Topeka to demand better pay and treatment.

**April 30, 2019** – Shortly after 7:30 EDT this morning the [**Associated Press reported**](https://www.apnews.com/0153cace08c84c8fbf34f9c6a7bdd4dd) that  Juan Guaido, the self-proclaimed President and defender of democracy in Venezuela, launched a military coup. 

The report from AP went on to say ""Venezuelan Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez said on Twitter that Nicolas Maduro’s government is confronting a small “coup attempt” led by military “traitors” backed by right-wing opponents.""

Details are extremely scarce.

On high alert in Washington, D.C. are the [**Embassy Protection Collective**](https://www.facebook.com/ColectivosporlaPaz/). In early April, with permission of the Venezuelan Government, a number of local residents moved into the Venezuelan Embassy to prevent occupation by Guaido supporters.

Shortly after the military coup began in Caracas, the Embassy Protection Collective posted the following on Social Media.

*""We are on alert and urging people to join us. There has been an increase in  undercovers around the embassy.*

*""No matter how coup turns out we are at greater risk. It looks like it is failing in Caracas but to early to be definitive. If it fails they mat want a victory by taking this embassy.*

*""We expect opposition protesters today and tomorrow.""*

Among those protecting the Venezuelan Embassy are Green Party members [Kevin Zeese](https://www.gp.org/kevin_zeese) and [Margaret Flowers](https://www.gp.org/dr_margaret_flowers). Medea Benjamin of [CodePink](https://www.codepink.org/), a 2000 Green Party candidate for US Senate in California, is also present.",2019-04-30T14:53:20+00:00
GreenParty,post,Occupation,5ep1ey,News2016,"""History suggests that if mankind is to survive, the next five hundred years must be rooted in the pre-Columbian ethic of the Native American...""","""History suggests that if mankind is to survive, the next five hundred years must be rooted in the pre-Columbian ethic of the Native American...The continuation of the past, the conqueror's exploitation of the earth, can mean only one thing. No one, Indian or non-Indian, will survive.—Rennard Strickland (Osage/Cherokee), Distinguished Professor Emeritus, University of Oregon School of Law 

Until the most recent blink of human time, Indian tribes exercised territorial sovereignty over nearly all of the land on this continent—two billion acres. Nature was abundant and, for the most part, in a state of remarkable balance. Most tribes affirmatively managed resources to maintain a sustainable existence...Native peoples' understanding of their traditional role as stewards of the land—a gift from the Creator—was that the Earth should be protected in perpetuity for the sake of future generations.

The occupation of indigenous America reduced tribal lands to four per-cent of aboriginal territory, and tribal jurisdiction receded along with the retreating boundaries. Authority over Nature's Trust—the land and resources on this continent—accordingly became vested in a new set of trustees: federal and state governments. These new sovereigns had little or no experience managing natural resources. The premise of their management philosophy has been exploitation rather than conservation, and they accordingly opened Native territorial lands to consumption by private interests. A philosophy more diametrically opposed to Native peoples' stewardship can hardly be imagined."" —Wood, Mary C. and Welcker, Zach, ""Tribes as Trustees Again (Part I): The Emerging Tribal Role in the Conservation Trust Movement"" (2008). Harvard Environmental Law Review, Vol. 32, 2008, pgs. 373-374.

[**The Green Party**](https://www.gp.org/) strongly opposes the U.S. administration's support of an attempted military coup in Venezuela. According to the Associated Press, opposition leader and self-proclaimed President Juan Guaido launched a military coup attempt against the Nicolas Maduro government about 7:30 am (EDT) this morning. While details are scarce, the action appears to have only limited military support.

The Green Party joins with the United Nations in recognition of **Nicolás Maduro** as the legitimate president of Venezuela.

The Green Party platform suppprts states that ""the U.S. must recognize the sovereignty of nation-states and their right of self-determination."" The Green Party has called for a policy of non-intervention and for sanctions against Venezuela to be lifted. 

The Green Party opposes the ongoing U.S. foreign policy of ""regime change"" that has been a characteristic of both Republican and Democratic administrations.

A new report shows that as many as 40,000 civilians have died in Venezuela since 2017 as a result of the sanctions.

On high alert in Washington, D.C. are the **Embassy Protection Collective**. In early April, with permission of the Venezuelan Government, a number of local residents moved into the Venezuelan Embassy to prevent occupation by Guaido supporters.  


It would be illegal under international law for the U.S. to facilitate control of the embassy to opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has asserted a claim to the office.   


Shortly after the military coup began in Caracas, the Embassy Protection Collective posted the following on Social Media:

*""We are on alert and urging people to join us. There has been an increase in undercovers around the embassy.*  


*""No matter how coup turns out we are at greater risk. It looks like it is failing in Caracas but to early to be definitive. If it fails they may want a victory by taking this embassy.*

* *The world has gotten a look into the abyss, and doesn’t like what it saw staring back*

**BOYNTON BEACH, FL** – As Iran’s General Qassem Suleimani was arriving on a mission of peace — having been invited to Iraq to help mediate relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia — he was brutally ambushed by an American drone on his way from the Baghdad Airport.  A leader of Iraq’s own anti-ISIS militias was killed in the same blast.

The Trump administration’s flurry of lies was so brazen as to be a deliberate challenge to the world.  “We done it and we’re glad.  Whatcha gonna do about it?”  The U.S. threatened Iran with nuclear devastation if Iran struck back.  People around the world were glued to their TV sets as the official commentators droned on.  World War III breaking out was a real possibility.  Even if Iran were “turned into a parking lot,” Iran made clear that it would go down shooting and an increasingly fragile imperial economy would go down with it.

### The world pushed back

Congress complained that — as much as Suleimani deserved to die for all the American blood he allegedly had on his hands — they should have been invited to the party first.  But Europe refused to praise Trump for murdering a foreign leader, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was “disappointed.”  The Iraqi government promptly demanded that the U.S. remove all its forces from the country, and the U.S. is now saying “Hell no, we won’t go!”

Most importantly, the American people — once again characterized as slack-jawed yahoos who would rally around their president in a frenzy of patriotic fervor — did not play their assigned role.  According to [an](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-dont-know-what-to-think-about-trumps-iran-strategy/)[ABC/Ipsos](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/majority-americans-disapprove-trumps-handling-iran-feel-safe/story?id=68219819) poll 56% of Americans disapproved of Trump’s handling of the assassination while 43% approved, and 52% thought that killing Suleimani made the U.S. less safe, as opposed to 25% thinking they were more safe.  Even 52% of Republicans are concerned about the possibility of entering into another war in the Middle East.

The Iranians did shoot back, hitting two U.S. bases in Iraq with missiles.  Despite Trump having threatened to hit 52 Iranian targets if Iran lifted a finger, the U.S. held its fire and settled for hitting the Iranians with some more sanctions.

The media are now working to re-frame the entire affair as some elaborate kabuki dance, nothing to see here, kid, move along.  Indeed, the American people did not fill the streets in protest.  The Europeans are shaken but not stirred.  Israel is remarkably quiet (Iran had announced that the Israeli city of Haifa was in its cross-hairs).  Everyone pretends that things have returned to normal.  But everyone knows this is only the calm before the next storm.

Underneath all the choreography, the world is undergoing a significant tectonic shift.  Yes, centrifugal forces towards breaking free from U.S. hegemony have been in irrevocable motion for some time, but this latest quake did much more than just rattle the china cabinet.

Trump has ripped the bloody mask away from not only himself, but from the whole New World Order as well.  The U.S. is forced to rule by naked power alone.  As they say, Rome wasn’t destroyed in a day, but ruling by naked power alone without the veneer of legitimacy is the beginning of the end of the Empire, when in the words of Roger Waters, we have “wrested technology’s sword from the hand of the war lords.”

### The Green Party stands with the people of the Middle EastSpeaking for the Green Party of Florida (GPFL), party Co-Chair Robin Harris says:

“We strongly condemn the assassination of General Suleimani by the United States.  It was outright murder.  Trump’s claim that this attack was done to protect American lives is a heinous lie!  Its only purpose was to shore up the oligarchs and imperialists.

“As a Black woman who observes daily genocide and the militant occupation of our neighborhoods, I stand in solidarity with the people of Iran and Iraq.  We applaud the efforts of Black Alliance for Peace, Code Pink, and every other organization fighting for peace and justice.  Finally, we demand the withdrawal of troops in all countries that the United States has an illegal presence in.”

#### LeBeau Kpadenou, GPFL Co-Chair, adds:

“We reject attempts to lay all this at the feet of Donald Trump, or at the feet of the Republican Party alone.  Not when the supposedly peace-loving Democrats fully backed increasing last year’s U.S. military budget by $22 billion more than had been asked for

“This only emphasizes the need for an independent socialist party.  We are the party that calls on the U.S. to withdraw from the Middle East.  We are the party that demands respect for the sovereignty and self-determination of all nations.

“And we join with all the people of the world in saying, let there be peace upon this earth.”

GreenParty,post,Occupation,4rfms9,BallzSpartan,Moving to a third party,"I am in a not so unique position of being unable to stomach voting for either of the two primary parties candidates. I have decided to vote for either Dr. Stein or Gov. Johnson. I know these two candidates have very different platforms so I am trying to decide which candidate is best for me. I hope you will be willing to show me why I should vote for your candidate over the other. Using, ontheissues.org, I notated what I like about each candidate. I hope this isn't being too demanding, please feel free to ignore if this has been posted too frequently. 

Abortion: While I am personally against abortion, I believe people should have the right to chose. I like Gov. Johnson's policy of right to choose up until the viability of the fetus. I like Dr. Stein's policy of birth control under healthcare and funded stem cell research. 

Economy: We are seriously underwater on our debt and we need to begin reducing debt but that is going to be difficult without an economy that is improving for the everyman and tax loopholes abound. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to immediately move to a balanced budget, cut defense spending and end bailouts of large corporations. I like that Dr. Stein wants to cut defense spending, tax bailout bonuses and move social healthcare spending to preventive care.

Civil Rights: I believe people should act as they feel, it isn't my place to tell someone else what they can do in their home with other consenting individuals. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to wants to get government out of the marriage business and legalizing prostitution. I like that Dr. Stein is for gay rights and pay equity.

Corporations: This is challenging, I know they have their place but they are buying too much favoritism. I think Gov. Johnson is right that we need to end corporate tax. I agree with Dr. Stein that the wealthy are paying far too little in taxes after all of the loopholes. 

Crime: Currently, far too many people are going to prison unnecessarily and that is creating a business. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to reduce the number of jailable offenses. I think Dr. Stein is right that minorities go to jail more frequently for the same offenses that white people often don't and that prison has become a business that is perverting the judicial system. 

Drugs: I feel drugs need to be decriminalized, punishment is not prevention. I like Dr. Stein's approach to put drug users into rehab but I worry it will become a money making scheme. 

Education: There are huge problems with our education system, it is primed to fail spectacularly. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to abolish student loans, I feel that moving all student loan funding to work study programs would be enormously beneficial. I like that Dr. Stein wants to make all public education free.

Energy: We need to move to renewable energy, solar energy is practically free and could power a huge portion of our grid if we could just the red tape out of the way. I like that Gov. Johnson is in favor of nuclear energy and dropping cap and trade. I like that Dr. Stein is aggressive on renewable energy and fracking. 

Environment: Change needs to happen immediately in order to protect the planet, we need to limit the negative impact we have. I like that Gov. Johnson is willing to be aggressive with air quality and preservation of endangered species. I like that Dr. Stein is aggressive on environmental controls but I dislike her policy on GMO's. 

Family: Both candidates are great here. 

Foreign Policy: I think the US currently meddles too much, aid should be aid because it is necessary, not because it furthers some agenda with a foreign dignitary. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to pull back on foreign aid and wants to fully open trade with Cuba. I like that Dr. Stein wants to trade with Cuba and end US blessing of Israeli occupation. 

Free Trade: I think free trade has its place but that it is currently being used as a bulldozer instead of a chisel. I'm not a fan of Gov. Johnson's support of NAFTA. I like that Dr. Stein is opposed to TPP. 

Government Reform: Big monied interest are making a democracy that no longer works for the everyman. I like that Gov. Johnson ran a self funded Governor campaign but worry about the extensiveness of his veto record. I like that Dr. Stein supports a voter bill of rights and doesn't take large money donations. 

Gun Control: I feel that I am with the majority of gun owners when I say some common sense gun control is what we want. I would like to see a mandatory gun safety class taught nationwide. I'm not a particularly fond of either candidates stance on this issue. 

Healthcare: I want to see a Government system that leverages the buying power of the entire US while allows people to continue to use private practice if they so choose. I look to South Korea as an example. I agree with Gov. Johnson that Obamacare simply isn't working. I agree with Dr. Stein that medicare for all leverages the weight of the American people to provide best cost per person.

Immigration: I think illegal immigration will continue as long as there is great disparity in quality of life. I agree with Gov. Johnson that we need to provide citizenship to make illegal immigrants into tax payers. I like that Dr. Stein wants to provide a path to citizenship. 

Homeland Security: I strongly dislike the Patriot Act and spying on citizens without just cause. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to end spying on citizens and believes it to be a violation of the 4th amendment. I like that Dr. Stein wants to provide whistleblower protections and start returning bases to their home country.

Jobs: I don't believe there is a silver bullet here but I tend to fall on the square deal side of the line. Work hard and you deserve to make a living wage in safe conditions. I agree with Gov. Johnson that companies create jobs but I worry that pigeonholes him into the private sector. I like that Dr. Stein wants to create green jobs, I worry that we end up with another overly bloated ""stimulus package"".

Social Security: I think we need to raise the age for social security and tie the age to a nonbiased age metric. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to raise the age but the only privatization I agree with is investing the principal in safe diversified holdings. I like that Dr. Stein errs on the side of no privatization.  

Taxes: Our current system is ripe with loopholes, avoidance schemes and income laundering. If possible, simplifying taxes to ensure everyone pays what they owe would be ideal. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to revolutionize and simplify our tax code. I like that Dr. Stein wants to implement growth from the bottom by cutting taxes from the bottom up. 

I like both candidates approach to technology.

War: I feel the US is currently too militaristically involved across the globe. It is expensive and creating as many enemies as it is defeating and the only way to properly do nation building is South Korea where it took 40 years and a lot of money. If we can't commit to that then we shouldn't tear the place down. I like that Gov. Johnson wants to cut money and influence to Israel and that the way we are currently doing nation building isn't working. I like that Dr. Stein wants to keep us out of conflicts as much as possible. 

If you've made it to here I want to thank you for taking the time to read my viewpoints and respond. I'm sure we will disagree on somethings and that is ok. I prefer to have my positions challenged so that I can see what I truly stand firm on and what is something I'm acting out based on emotion or misinformation. Thank you, I look forward to your comments. ",2016-07-05T23:47:36+00:00
GreenParty,comment,Occupation,d50u66t,jetsjets369,,"For me, the issues above all other issues are campaign finance and media coverage.

Campaign finance is obvious. To address the other issues (healthcare, college affordability, moving to a renewable energy source, etc), we need representatives who work for the people. The current representatives largely work for rich billionaires, meaning that they're less incentivized to address the issues that matter to the constituency. If we don't address the issue of campaign finance, even our net neutrality could be at risk.

Media coverage is a product of the failing campaign finance system. The corporations that bribe political candidates also own media networks. Wonder why CNN is covering Hillary R. Clinton so much? Of course, Time Warner owns CNN and funds Hillary Clinton. This is the crux of why I believe that Jill E. Stein is a better candidate than Gary E. Johnson. The rich capitalist industrialists are more willing to broadcast Johnson, who protects their interests, than Stein, who protects your interests.

Good luck!",2016-07-06T01:49:36+00:00

I like Johnson on foreign policy but couldn't disagree more with his perspective on economics. 

You've got to decide what is most important to you and I'm really excited to see people beginning to understand that the corporately owned political parties do not represent us.

GreenParty,comment,Occupation,d51b5c3,tramflye,,"I can help flesh out some Green points on the economy and such.

Greens are supportive of workplace democracy, Johnson wants the market to be however it comes out to be. This I believe to be my biggest gripe with the Libertarians. Having the workers own their own businesses means that more of the profit goes to those who do the work, not just those who buy business after business and live off of whatever salary they draw. It's essentially rent seeking and it has no place in a well functioning economy.

Essentially, giving tax incentives to co-ops would give money to small businesses for them to grow, it just happens to be that these small businesses would be worker owned and operated. They could grow, surely, but that characteristic would remain. 

Having corporate co-ops would be the best of both worlds for you, I'd imagine (Mondragon is the favorite to point to). We could reduce taxes on businesses so as to make them more competitive on a global scale, but ensure that the people who work there are getting a fair share of the profits and a voice in the workplace. 

The Green New Deal is, at this point, essential to combat climate change and provide jobs. The unemployment rate we should be looking at is, IIRC, the U-6 rate, which includes those who have dropped out of the workforce altogether, those working part time, and those who are underpaid. That's still around 10% which means that our economy is not functioning anywhere near full capacity, which means that productivity is hurting for it. By employing people in green jobs, we can combat climate change, push alternative energy globally (by making the equipment cheaper through US manufacturing), give back some dignity to the American working class, and pull capitalism just enough from the brink of collapse to transition slowly toward a better society.

This is a pivotal point in history...

What can we learn from the Second World War?

A  historical  example  of  success  at  the  level  of  effort  required  to  confront  the  climate  crisis  was  that  of  the  Allies  taking  on  fascism  and  Hitler’s  ruthless  expansionistic  regime.  What  the  Allied  efforts  in  the  Second  World War can tell us is the following: Giving up is not an option. Political courage is needed. Incremental actions cannot meet the challenge.For five days in May 1940, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was surrounded by military advisors, senior civil servants and Cabinet members demanding that he negotiate terms of surrender with Hitler.

The facts were very bleak. The details were not shared with the British public but citizens knew that much was amiss. The British government prepared a daily report on public morale.  In May 1940, “fatalism (was) on the rise...and women, in particular, have stopped listening to the wireless.”The entire British army was pinned down on a beach in northern France, at Dunkirk. France had just surrender-dered. England’s coastline was essentially defenseless. Gun turrets along the coast were under construction – hoping to fool German aircraft pilots by using telephone poles instead of guns. The US government refused to engage. Churchill was told there was no hope.Then he thought of something. How many civilian vessels are there in Dover?  Just across the English Channel were 861 civilian boats – fishing boats, ferries, vessels of all kinds.  And this is why the Dunkirk story matters – it was not possible, but it happened. Those 861 boats rescued over 300,000 men. Sadly, 243 of these boats were sunk by German fire, but still the entire British army and tens of thousands of French soldiers were rescued. An evacuation against all odds inspired a nation on the verge of surrender to oppose Hitler – and win.Such  leadership  has  a  phenomenal  impact  on  morale.  C.S.  Lewis,  theologian  and  author  of  the  Narnia  Chronicles,wrote in his diary, “I find that everyone I meet feels so much more encouraged now that things are so much worse.”Facing facts and organizing ourselves to confront a challenge is how we will build a robust and resilient society in the face of a changing climate – in Canada and around the world. In the spirit of Dunkirk, we can ask ourselves, “What can I do with my little boat? Where and how do I pitch in?” As in all efforts to tackle big threats and long odds, we need all hands on deck

**Dunkirk**

Updated:Mar 29, 2019Original:Jan 25, 2018

&#x200B;

Dunkirk is a small town on the coast of France that was the scene of a massive military campaign during World War II. From May 26 to June 4, 1940, some 338,000 British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and other Allied troops were evacuated from Dunkirk to England as German forces closed in on them. The massive operation, involving hundreds of naval and civilian vessels, became known as the “Miracle of Dunkirk” and served as a turning point for the Allied war effort.

WHERE IS DUNKIRK?

Dunkirk is located in the north of France, on the shores of the North Sea near the Belgian-French border. The Strait of Dover, where the distance between England and France is just 21 miles across the English Channel, is located to the southwest.

Because of its seaside location near the borders of three European powers, Dunkirk (known as Dunkerque in French) and the surrounding area have been the site of centuries of commerce and travel, as well as numerous bloody battles.

BATTLE OF DUNKIRK

On May 10, 1940, the so-called “phony war” ended decisively when Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium in a blitzkrieg (German for “lightning war”) attack.

In the face of such a coordinated strategy, superior air power and highly mobile ground forces supported by panzer tanks, all three countries would succumb quickly: The Germans occupied Luxembourg on May 10, the Netherlands on May 14 and Belgium by the end of the month.

Soon after the blitzkrieg began, German forces invaded France—not along the Maginot Line, which the Allies had expected, but through the Ardennes Forest, moving steadily along the Somme Valley toward the English Channel.

As they advanced, German forces cut off all communication and transport between the northern and southern branches of Allied forces, pushing several hundred thousand Allied troops in the north into an increasingly small sliver of the French coast.

By May 19, General John Gort, commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had begun to weigh the possibility of evacuating his entire force by sea in order to save them from certain annihilation by the approaching Nazi troops.

WINSTON CHURCHILL

Meanwhile, in London, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain had resigned under pressure on May 13, making way for a new wartime coalition government headed by Winston Churchill. At first, British command opposed evacuation, and French forces wanted to hold out as well.

But with the BEF and its allies forced back on the French port of Dunkirk, located on the shores of the North Sea just 10 km (6.2 miles) from the Belgian border, Churchill soon became convinced evacuation was the only option.

ADOLF HITLER

In planning this risky operation, the Allies got a helping hand from a surprising source: Adolf Hitler, who on May 24 gave the order to halt the advance of German panzer divisions bearing down on Dunkirk.

Hitler’s decision has been attributed to his generals’ worries over a possible Allied counterattack (like the failed one on May 21 south of Arras) as well as Luftwaffe commander Hermann Goering’s insistence that his air forces could prevent any evacuation attempt at Dunkirk.

Hitler gave the tanks the go-ahead again on May 26, but by that time the Allies had gained crucial time to put their preparations in place.

OPERATION DYNAMO

On the evening of May 26, the British began the evacuation from Dunkirk, using the codename Operation Dynamo.

Vice Admiral Bertram Ramsay directed the efforts, leading a team working out of a room deep inside the Dover cliffs that had once contained a generator known as a dynamo (giving the operation its name).

The Luftwaffe’s relentless bombing attacks on the harbor slowed the evacuation process, even as Royal Air Force (RAF) planes tried to delay or stop the German planes from reaching the beaches, losing many aircraft in the process.

DUNKIRK EVACUATION

On the first full day, Operation Dynamo was only able to evacuate about 7,500 men from Dunkirk; around 10,000 got out the following day (May 28).

As Dunkirk had such a shallow beach, Royal Navy vessels couldn’t reach it, and the Allies put out a call for smaller ships to carry troops from the shore to the larger ships further out in the North Sea. Some 800 to 1,200 boats, many of them leisure or fishing crafts, eventually aided in the evacuation from Dunkirk.

Some were requisitioned by the Navy and crewed by naval personnel, while others were manned by their civilian owners and crew. The first members of this small armada—which would become known as the “Little Ships”—began arriving on the beaches of Dunkirk on the morning of May 28, helping to speed up the evacuation.

At the outset, Churchill and the rest of British command expected that the evacuation from Dunkirk could rescue only around 45,000 men at most. But the success of Operation Dynamo exceeded all expectations. On May 29, more than 47,000 British troops were rescued; more than 53,000, including the first French troops, made it out on May 30.

By the time the evacuations ended, some 198,000 British and 140,000 French troops would manage to get off the beaches at Dunkirk—a total of some 338,000 men. An additional 90,000 Allied forces were left behind, along with the bulk of the BEF’s heavy guns and tanks, when the resistance ended on the morning of June 4 and German troops occupied Dunkirk.

LE PARADIS MASSACRE

On May 27, after holding off a German company until their ammunition was spent, 99 soldiers from the Royal Norfolk Regiment retreated to a farmhouse in the village of Paradis, about 50 miles from Dunkirk.

Agreeing to surrender, the trapped regiment started to file out of the farmhouse, waving a white flag tied to a bayonet. They were met by German machine-gun fire.

They tried again and the British regiment was ordered by an English-speaking German officer to an open field where they were searched and divested of everything from gas masks to cigarettes. They were then marched into a pit where machine guns had been placed in fixed positions.

A German officer, Captain Fritz Knochlein, gave the order: “Fire!” Those Brits who survived the machine-gun fire were either stabbed to death with bayonets or shot dead with pistols.

Of the 99 members of the regiment, only two survived, both privates: Albert Pooley and William O’Callaghan. They lay among the dead until dark, then, in the middle of a rainstorm, they crawled to a farmhouse, where their wounds were tended.

With nowhere else to go, they surrendered again to the Germans, who made them POWs. Pooley’s leg was so badly wounded he was repatriated to England in April 1943 in exchange for some wounded German soldiers.

Upon his return to Britain, Pooley’s gruesome story was not believed. Only when O’Callaghan returned home and verified the story was a formal investigation made.

After the war, a British military tribunal in Hamburg found Captain Knochlein, who gave the fateful order to fire, guilty of a war crime. He was hanged for his offense.

IMPACT OF DUNKIRK

While the German blitzkrieg was undoubtedly successful (France would call for an armistice by mid-June 1940), the largely successful evacuation of the bulk of Britain’s trained troops from near-annihilation proved to be a key moment in the Allied war effort.

Germany had hoped defeat at Dunkirk would lead Britain to negotiate a speedy exit from the conflict. Instead, the “Miracle at Dunkirk” became a rallying cry for the duration of the war, and an iconic symbol of the British spirit, leaving a cultural legacy of pride and perseverance that endures nearly eight decades later.

“We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory,” Churchill warned in a speech delivered on June 4, 1940. “Wars are not won by evacuations.”

In the same speech, however, he delivered a stirring statement of the British resolve that would serve the nation well over the next five grueling years of warfare:

“\[We\] shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.”

AFTERMATH OF DUNKIRK

Despite the successful evacuation at Dunkirk, thousands of French troops were left behind and taken prisoner by the advancing Germans. Also abandoned on the shores of Dunkirk were massive supplies of ammunition, machine guns, tanks, motorcycles, jeeps and anti-aircraft artillery.

With Western Europe abandoned by its main defenders, the German army swept through the rest of France, and Paris fell on June 14. Eight days later, Henri Petain signed an armistice with the Nazis at Compiegne.

Germany annexed half of France, leaving the other half in the hands of their puppet French rulers. It wasn’t until June 6, 1944, that the liberation of Western Europe finally began with the successful Allied landing at Normandy.

Elizabeth May's history troubles

Green leader's history references puzzle historians

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May reveals her party’s platform during a campaign stop in Toronto. The preamble has some erroneous historical references (Evan Mitsui/CBC)

Elizabeth May is an expert on climate change and the environment. She has a law degree from Dalhousie University. And for a time, she studied theology at St. Paul's University in Ottawa with an eye to becoming an Anglican priest.

But for all the Green Party leader's interests and talents, it seems that history is not her strong suit.

The Green's electoral platform, released Monday, begins with a personal message from May that casts the fight against human-caused global warming as a daunting, yet winnable struggle — likening it to the Allied efforts to defeat Adolf Hitler and the Nazis in the Second World War.

""Giving up is not an option. Political courage is needed. Incremental actions cannot meet the challenge,"" she writes.

Chooses the Dunkirk story

However, the story that May chooses to illustrate the necessary ""can-do"" spirit — about Winston Churchill and the spring 1940 evacuation of British troops from the beaches of Dunkirk, France — is rife with factual errors, and appears to be more in line with some fictionalized films than the history books.

""The entire British army was pinned down on a beach in northern France, at Dunkirk. France had just surrendered,"" she begins, swinging and missing twice: The British had sent about a third of their army to the continent. And French troops fought bravely to cover their retreat to the Channel beaches, and continued to do so for weeks after the May 27-June 4 evacuations. Their formal surrender didn't come until June 22, 1940.

May then turns her attention to the legendary ""little ships,"" the fleet of 861 civilian fishing boats, pleasure craft and ferries that helped retrieve the trapped soldiers. She writes that it was Winston Churchill's idea to send them, although virtually every historical source credits Admiral Betram Ramsay and his staff for coming up with the plan.

And the Green leader suggests the small boats ""rescued over 300,000 men,"" when the fact is that a British Navy flotilla, including 41 destroyers, 36 minesweepers, and more than 100 other ships carried the bulk of the 338,000 evacuees back to the U.K.

John Broich, a British Empire and World War II historian at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, gives May credit for trying to bring a historical perspective to her politics, but said she appears fuzzy on the details.

""That small ships story feels great, but it's not true,"" he said. ""It was the destroyers that were going back and forth ... And she says that Churchill came up with the plan? Oh my gosh, no, no!""

It's just sort of fake history on a catastrophic level,​​​

\- James Holland, Second World War historian

A Green Party spokesman confirmed that May did write the platform preface herself, and said that her primary source was Five Days in London: May 1940, a 2001 book by the late American historian John Lukacs.

Sounds like Hollywood

Although another expert says he detects some Hollywood influences in May's version of events.

James Holland, an English historian and broadcaster who wrote about the evacuations in his book, The Battle of Britain: Five Months that Changed History, said May's tale appears to be a pastiche of factoids from Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk and Darkest Hour, a 2017 Churchill biopic starring Gary Oldman.

He pointed to a section where the Green leader suggests that the British PM was ""surrounded by military advisers, senior civil servants and Cabinet members demanding that he negotiate terms of surrender with Hitler.""

""That's what happens in Darkest Hour,"" said Holland. ""But that entire film is a crock ....""

Holland said that the discussion of possible peace negotiations — first detailed in Lukac's  book — was mostly confined to the five-man war cabinet, and that the main proponent for the talks, Viscount Halifax, the foreign secretary, ultimately found little support.

Reading the Green leader's platform introduction aloud over the phone from London, Holland became increasingly incensed, calling it ""rubbish"" and ""embarrassing.""

""It's just sort of fake history on a catastrophic level,"" he said. ""Why would you write about this without checking the facts when it's not your core subject?""

May's message concludes with a call on Canadians to tap into ""the spirit of Dunkirk.""

All hands on deck

""We can ask ourselves, 'What can I do with my little boat? Where and how do I pitch in?', she writes. ""As in all efforts to tackle big threats and long odds, we need all hands on deck!""

Case Western's Broich said he doesn't think that the evacuations are really the metaphor that the Green leader thinks they are, given that it was the world's then-most powerful navy that really saved the day.

""I would've thought it'd be far more natural to emphasize how World War II showed the transformative power of government and industry working together to solve a global crisis. Everyone sacrificed a little to gain a lot,"" said Broich. ""Still, I give her marks for effort.""

Perhaps May should have heeded the words of Churchill himself on Dunkirk.

""We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory,"" he told the House of Commons during his famous ""we will fight them on the beaches"" speech on June 4, 1940.  ""Wars are not won by evacuations.""",2019-09-17T12:01:17+00:00
GreenParty,post,Israel-Palestine War/War,1b4ii1h,JohnJD1302,[Discussion/Rant] I'm increasingly seeing the Rochdale by-election as a HUGE miss for the Greens (England),"Since the Commons seat of Rochdale was vacated following the unfortunate death of Sir Tony Lloyd, the by-election campaign there would turn out to be one of the most chaotic political events of the year in Britain, tragically resulting in the return to Parliament of the grifter, transphobe, Hezbollah-supporter, antisemite, and overall vile human being, George Galloway.

Rochdale has a Muslim population of around 30%, so it was inevitable that Gaza would be a major contention of this campaign, and that a candidate who is vocal in stopping the plight of Palestinians would have a good chance of taking the seat.

George Galloway's posturing as an anti-war candidates hides the fact of his climate change denial, his transphobia, his previous endorsement of Tories, and the fact that he was endorsed by Nick Griffin, the neofascist BNP leader. His campaign has even been accused of send two completely different messages to Muslims and non-Muslims, with two separate campaign letters sent to voters containing completely contradictory messaging, one of them echoing Trump-style rhetoric. This by-election should not be celebrated by any true progressive.

Which is why I find it tragic that the local Greens there have failed to capitalize on the fact that the Labour candidate was suspended for their comments on Israel. The Greens could have put out a candidate who would be a true progressive voice against the far-right Israeli government and be a representative of Rochdale's Muslim community, and expose the toxicity of Galloway's politics, while at the same time, represent non-Muslims by catering to local kitchen table issues, much like the independent candidate David Tully who came second.

Instead, the candidate they put out has only alienated the Muslim community. Even if such comments they made were in the past, it was only right these comments has surfaced, as one cannot be too wary of the character of any individual trying to represent constituents.

This lost was also a HUGE miss. If only the Greens had won this by-election, imagine the massive PR win of the Greens defeating Galloway. Progressives would've flock to the party, a massive flow of donations would've come their way, be a more serious threat to Starmer, and it may not have been very hard to hold on to that seat in the next GE.


This by-election stall and MUST serve an incredibly important lesson for the Green Party of England and Wales, if we were to try to get more MPs to counter the increasingly blurred two-party system, of Sunak's disastrous Tory government, and Starmer's Tory Lite Labour. Greens must being in Green values and adapt them to fit the needs of people where they run. Improved vetting of candidates must also be done, and that we shall campaign harder and harder, TOGETHER with other like-minded progressives, to stop this stagnant two-party system, get Britain back, and stop its support of the far-right Israeli state, and champion a free Palestine.",2024-03-02T07:23:53+00:00

By Mark Dunlea

This year marks the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that killed more than 3,000.

9/11 was used as the justification for U S invasions in the Middle East and the war on terrorism. It was used to curtail civil liberties and suppress political dissent at home, and to further bankrupt our public treasury in order to pay for an ever expanding military industrial complex. Our government lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq[\[1\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn1) to invade a country which had no role in 9/11.

For the first decade after 9/11, I annually published an op ed in the Albany Times Union and elsewhere addressing “the unanswered” questions from 9/11 and the wrong policy responses adopted by our government (I did issue a 9/11 statement for the 2018 anniversary[\[2\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn2).)

Like many, I was traumatized by the murders, particularly watching the World Trade Center towers collapse over and over again with speculation that as many as 50,000 people might still be trapped inside. I am haunted by the images of people hurtling to their deaths, flying down the outside of the Tower to escape a worse fate inside

I was equally horrified that as the smoke rose from the WTC that politicians and the mainstream media rushed to bang the drums of war.  I am proud that within hours after the towers fell I issued a statement for the Green Party opposing the bipartisan rush to war. For one of the few moments in my lifetime the world was united in sympathy with America. We had the opportunity to use it to build a world more centered on peace and common good. America instead chose a different path.

9/11 became an excuse to unleash American military forces in pursuit of a global American empire in support of corporate globalization

One of the first casualties of war is the truth. It quickly became obvious that the “truth” about 9/11 was never going to come out.

Unlike the 9/11 Truth Movement, I was willing to accept the general narrative of the 9/11 Commission – that foreign terrorists hijacked 4 planes to kill as many people as possible. As someone who has worked with the government politicians and bureaucrats for over 40 years, I dismiss government conspiracies out of hand for being way beyond their competency to pull off.

The 9/11 Commission was an exercise in damage control to protect the reputation of our national leaders and of our foreign policy and intelligence community. The failure to ""connect the dots"" to prevent the terrorist attacks of 9/11 ranks among the worst intelligence failures in American history.[\[3\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn3) The official report blames this on bureaucratic competition and non-cooperation. I would more describe it – at a minimum - as criminal negligence. The Bush administration for instance for months after September 11th kept hidden from the American public the fact that they received prior warnings from other governments including Britain and Israel about possible terrorist attacks, including hijackings, by bin Laden and his associates.[\[4\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn4)

The first – and only – article that I wrote that went viral was my outrage that President Bush wanted Henry Kissinger to head up the commission. Kissinger was the architect of the 9/11 terrorist attack three decades prior– the overthrow and murder of President Allende in Chile[\[5\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn5). I documented not only Kissinger’s role in promoting terrorism but the rampant conflicts of interests among the other foreign intelligence members that dominated the Commission. Kissinger withdrew a few days after my article appeared – though largely because he did not want to disclose his rogue gallery of clients.

The two co-chairs of the Commission - Tom Keane, former Republican Governor of NJ and Democrat Lee Hamilton - later wrote a book where they outlined two main lies from the Commission’s investigation. (They also wrote in the NY Times about how the CIA undercut the investigation by destroying potential evidence.[\[6\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn6)) The first lie was that the prime motivation for the hijackers was the US role in supporting Israel against Palestine, not the fact that the US had built air bases in Saudi Arabia. However, the more critical lie led them to initially wanting the Pentagon generals to be tried for perjury.

The generals lied to the Commission (and Congress and the public) in denying that the NORAD air command was running an exercise the morning of 9/11 involving faked hijacked airplanes[\[7\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn7). Vanity Fair won litigation to publish NORAD’s transcripts from that morning as the air controllers pleaded to take the fake airplanes off the screen so they could figure out how to direct the Air Force to respond to the real hijackers.[\[8\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn8)

What has not been answered is why did the General’s repeatedly lie about this? If I was the mastermind of 9/11 and knew that the US was going to run an exercise with faked hijacked airplanes, you can bet that would be the day I would choose to launch my own attack.  So how did the hijackers learn about the training exercise (and other information like Logan airport in Boston[\[9\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn9) having probably the worst security in the country)?

9/11 Truthers point out that the neocons in the government (i.e., Cheney and Rumsfeld) openly wrote about the need for a “Pearl Harbor” event[\[10\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn10) to provide a pretext to invade Iraq to seize its oil. Other possibilities include someone providing the info for money or blackmail. Or was the intelligence community so incompetent that foreign opponents could figure it out?

Or was this information provided to some foreign allies that then leaked it to the 9/11 terrorists? Two possibilities are Saudi Arabia, one of the most oppressive and brutal regimes on the planet[\[11\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn11), and/or  ISI[\[12\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn12) (Inter-services Intelligence), the powerful Pakistani version of the CIA and FBI that often seems to operate independently of the civilian elected officials

There has been much speculation about the role of Saudi Arabia in the attacks. 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis (not Iraqis). Only recently were the “missing pages” about Saudi Arabia possible ties to the hijackers from the 9/11 report released[\[13\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn13).

One issue is the role of the Saudi ruling family in funding Al Qaeda[\[14\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn14). Many believe that the Saudi’s provide funding to such terrorists as protection money. Go ahead and take your fight against the infidels, fight Israel and their allies, just make sure you don’t engage in such activities in the Kingdom itself.

The 9/11 report was unable to document who funded the 9/11 attacks. They said however that the actual source of funding was not important since the $500,000 estimated cost could have come from Al Qaeda’s petty cash as part of its estimated annual $30 million budget.[\[15\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn15)

While the Commission felt documenting the 9/11 money trail was not important, the federal government allegedly felt that “terrorism financing” was so critical that they launched a sting operation in Albany to entrap a pizza store owner and his witnessing Imam. While even the local mainstream media quickly decided the sting operation was bogus[\[16\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn16), Araf and Hussein were sentenced to decades in prison. Meanwhile, the operative who organized the sting[\[17\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn17) to escape prosecution for selling false identifies went on to become the owner of the limousine in which 20 individuals recently died in Schoharie. [\[18\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn18)

Bin Laden comes from a prominent family whose construction firm was the builder of choice for the Saudi regime[\[19\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn19). There are reports that the Bush and Clinton administration restricted the ability of the intelligence community to go after bin Laden and other Saudis out of the desire to maintain our “special relationship” with the Saudi oil wealth[\[20\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn20). This was not something addressed in depth by the 9/11 Commission.

Nor was the possible central role of the ISI addressed by the 9/11 Commission. The ISI have been closely aligned with the Taliban and al Qaeda. There were mainstream reports by media outlets including CBS that the ISI wired $100,000 to the lead hijacker shortly before the attack[\[21\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn21). In Angelina Jolie’s movie Mighty Heart about Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street journalist who was murdered while investigating the relationship between the ISI and Al Qaeda, a key moment is when she discovers that the person they think killed her husband is the ISI operative who wired the funds to the hijackers[\[22\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn22). If true (something the 9/11 Commission should have investigated), one question would be whether the money was just part of the ISI’s possible ongoing payments to Al Qaeda or that they knew it was going to support the hijacking. 

Another issue not addressed is how the US – starting under President Carter and continued by Reagan – created the conditions that allowed the Al Qaeda training camps to operate in Afghanistan. It was a classic case of blowback.

In 1979, Carter began to fund the Afghanistan warlords (terrorists) in their efforts to overthrow the central government that was closely aligned with the Soviet government.[\[23\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn23) This government strongly supported women’s rights. The US was interested in drawing the Soviets into their own version of Vietnam on their southern border, with the Soviets worried about their own internal struggles with Muslim dissidents.

Bin Laden was part of the Saudi contingent that came to Afghanistan to fight the Soviets. Bin Laden’s role was to provide financing from his family’s wealth. He was apparently more reasonable / easier to deal with than the mujahedeen, so the CIA established a working relationship with him.[\[24\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn24) The country became chaotic following the collapse of the central government, with the various warlords and their ever-shifting allegiances controlling their own territories. To stabilize the situation, the Pakistani ISI (possibly along with the CIA) encouraged their allies the Taliban to migrate over the border into Afghanistan to “take control”[\[25\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn25). At some point the Taliban struck a deal to allow bin Laden and others to operate their training camps in exchange for providing support in the fight against the Northern Alliance warlords.[\[26\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn26) (Note this is an abbreviated and simplified version.)

One of the most incredulous parts of the 9/11 Commission report – which the report itself admits defies belief – is how the lead hijackers were recruited. It reads like a bad Saturday Night Live skit. (Others have provided a far different narrative[\[27\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn27).) The source of this information, alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, is supposed to finally to go to trial eighteen years after his capture.[\[28\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn28)(His nephew led the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.[\[29\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn29)) It will be interesting to see if any new information emerges.

After 9/11 most of us pledged to “never forget” and seek justice for the victims. Instead, our government has inflicted vengeance which has killed hundreds of thousands of individuals who had no role in 9/11 while only bin Laden was held “accountable” (without a public trial that might have answered more questions). The use of terrorism and violence against civilians has continued to increase. Those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it.  Increasingly the greatest threat to our national security is climate change[\[30\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn30), not terrorism. It is time that our tax dollars were re-oriented to this effort while ending the “war on terrorism” as the failure[\[31\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn31) it has been.

By Mark Dunlea

This year marks the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that killed more than 3,000.

9/11 was used as the justification for U S invasions in the Middle East and the war on terrorism. It was used to curtail civil liberties and suppress political dissent at home, and to further bankrupt our public treasury in order to pay for an ever expanding military industrial complex. Our government lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq[\[1\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn1) to invade a country which had no role in 9/11.

For the first decade after 9/11, I annually published an op ed in the Albany Times Union and elsewhere addressing “the unanswered” questions from 9/11 and the wrong policy responses adopted by our government (I did issue a 9/11 statement for the 2018 anniversary[\[2\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn2).)

Like many, I was traumatized by the murders, particularly watching the World Trade Center towers collapse over and over again with speculation that as many as 50,000 people might still be trapped inside. I am haunted by the images of people hurtling to their deaths, flying down the outside of the Tower to escape a worse fate inside

I was equally horrified that as the smoke rose from the WTC that politicians and the mainstream media rushed to bang the drums of war.  I am proud that within hours after the towers fell I issued a statement for the Green Party opposing the bipartisan rush to war. For one of the few moments in my lifetime the world was united in sympathy with America. We had the opportunity to use it to build a world more centered on peace and common good. America instead chose a different path.

9/11 became an excuse to unleash American military forces in pursuit of a global American empire in support of corporate globalization

One of the first casualties of war is the truth. It quickly became obvious that the “truth” about 9/11 was never going to come out.

Unlike the 9/11 Truth Movement, I was willing to accept the general narrative of the 9/11 Commission – that foreign terrorists hijacked 4 planes to kill as many people as possible. As someone who has worked with the government politicians and bureaucrats for over 40 years, I dismiss government conspiracies out of hand for being way beyond their competency to pull off.

The 9/11 Commission was an exercise in damage control to protect the reputation of our national leaders and of our foreign policy and intelligence community. The failure to ""connect the dots"" to prevent the terrorist attacks of 9/11 ranks among the worst intelligence failures in American history.[\[3\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn3) The official report blames this on bureaucratic competition and non-cooperation. I would more describe it – at a minimum - as criminal negligence. The Bush administration for instance for months after September 11th kept hidden from the American public the fact that they received prior warnings from other governments including Britain and Israel about possible terrorist attacks, including hijackings, by bin Laden and his associates.[\[4\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn4)

The first – and only – article that I wrote that went viral was my outrage that President Bush wanted Henry Kissinger to head up the commission. Kissinger was the architect of the 9/11 terrorist attack three decades prior– the overthrow and murder of President Allende in Chile[\[5\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn5). I documented not only Kissinger’s role in promoting terrorism but the rampant conflicts of interests among the other foreign intelligence members that dominated the Commission. Kissinger withdrew a few days after my article appeared – though largely because he did not want to disclose his rogue gallery of clients.

The two co-chairs of the Commission - Tom Keane, former Republican Governor of NJ and Democrat Lee Hamilton - later wrote a book where they outlined two main lies from the Commission’s investigation. (They also wrote in the NY Times about how the CIA undercut the investigation by destroying potential evidence.[\[6\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn6)) The first lie was that the prime motivation for the hijackers was the US role in supporting Israel against Palestine, not the fact that the US had built air bases in Saudi Arabia. However, the more critical lie led them to initially wanting the Pentagon generals to be tried for perjury.

The generals lied to the Commission (and Congress and the public) in denying that the NORAD air command was running an exercise the morning of 9/11 involving faked hijacked airplanes[\[7\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn7). Vanity Fair won litigation to publish NORAD’s transcripts from that morning as the air controllers pleaded to take the fake airplanes off the screen so they could figure out how to direct the Air Force to respond to the real hijackers.[\[8\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn8)

What has not been answered is why did the General’s repeatedly lie about this? If I was the mastermind of 9/11 and knew that the US was going to run an exercise with faked hijacked airplanes, you can bet that would be the day I would choose to launch my own attack.  So how did the hijackers learn about the training exercise (and other information like Logan airport in Boston[\[9\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn9) having probably the worst security in the country)?

9/11 Truthers point out that the neocons in the government (i.e., Cheney and Rumsfeld) openly wrote about the need for a “Pearl Harbor” event[\[10\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn10) to provide a pretext to invade Iraq to seize its oil. Other possibilities include someone providing the info for money or blackmail. Or was the intelligence community so incompetent that foreign opponents could figure it out?

Or was this information provided to some foreign allies that then leaked it to the 9/11 terrorists? Two possibilities are Saudi Arabia, one of the most oppressive and brutal regimes on the planet[\[11\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn11), and/or  ISI[\[12\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn12) (Inter-services Intelligence), the powerful Pakistani version of the CIA and FBI that often seems to operate independently of the civilian elected officials

There has been much speculation about the role of Saudi Arabia in the attacks. 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis (not Iraqis). Only recently were the “missing pages” about Saudi Arabia possible ties to the hijackers from the 9/11 report released[\[13\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn13).

While the Commission felt documenting the 9/11 money trail was not important, the federal government allegedly felt that “terrorism financing” was so critical that they launched a sting operation in Albany to entrap a pizza store owner and his witnessing Imam. While even the local mainstream media quickly decided the sting operation was bogus[\[16\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn16), Araf and Hussein were sentenced to decades in prison. Meanwhile, the operative who organized the sting[\[17\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn17) to escape prosecution for selling false identifies went on to become the owner of the limousine in which 20 individuals recently died in Schoharie. [\[18\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn18)

Bin Laden comes from a prominent family whose construction firm was the builder of choice for the Saudi regime[\[19\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn19). There are reports that the Bush and Clinton administration restricted the ability of the intelligence community to go after bin Laden and other Saudis out of the desire to maintain our “special relationship” with the Saudi oil wealth[\[20\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn20).

He was apparently more reasonable / easier to deal with than the mujahedeen, so the CIA established a working relationship with him.[\[24\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn24) The country became chaotic following the collapse of the central government, with the various warlords and their ever-shifting allegiances controlling their own territories. To stabilize the situation, the Pakistani ISI (possibly along with the CIA) encouraged their allies the Taliban to migrate over the border into Afghanistan to “take control”[\[25\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn25). At some point the Taliban struck a deal to allow bin Laden and others to operate their training camps in exchange for providing support in the fight against the Northern Alliance warlords.[\[26\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn26) (Note this is an abbreviated and simplified version.)

One of the most incredulous parts of the 9/11 Commission report – which the report itself admits defies belief – is how the lead hijackers were recruited. It reads like a bad Saturday Night Live skit. (Others have provided a far different narrative[\[27\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn27).) The source of this information, alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, is supposed to finally to go to trial eighteen years after his capture.[\[28\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn28)(His nephew led the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.[\[29\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn29)) It will be interesting to see if any new information emerges.

After 9/11 most of us pledged to “never forget” and seek justice for the victims. Instead, our government has inflicted vengeance which has killed hundreds of thousands of individuals who had no role in 9/11 while only bin Laden was held “accountable” (without a public trial that might have answered more questions). The use of terrorism and violence against civilians has continued to increase. Those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it.  Increasingly the greatest threat to our national security is climate change[\[30\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn30), not terrorism. It is time that our tax dollars were re-oriented to this effort while ending the “war on terrorism” as the failure[\[31\]](https://www.gp.org/unanswered_questions#_ftn31) it has been.

GreenParty,post,Israel Defense Forces,17jvvz5,jethomas5,What should the USA do about Israel?,"This is not about what we can practically do. In the short run both major parties are dominated by zionist lobbyists etc, and will do pretty much whatever Netanyahu tells them to. (Except that every president since GWB has refused to invade Iran when Netanyahu told them to.)

But what *should* we do?

I say. the USA should issue every Jewish Israel a US passport and let them come live here if they want to. No Israeli should be forced to stay in harm's way.

And all support for the Israeli nation should be stopped.

I say that when a nation thinks their choices are genocide or continual culling, never quite enough to call it genocide but never a better choice than killing a fraction of the ""enemy"" population every few years, the USA should try to avoid alliance with that nation.

Like a friend told me when I was starting to get involved with a problematic woman, ""Never take on a girlfriend who owns a dragon ranch.""

Israel has nothing much to offer the USA. They are on bad terms with most of their neighbors, though some are trying to tolerate them for our sake and because they are so dangerous.

They do not help us with our wars. They help us more by staying strictly apart from them.

There are some US supply dumps in Israel, and Israelis object that the US flag flies over them. They contain supplies that the Israelis can use if they need to, that we don't need to have there.

Their intelligence service does provide the USA with vital information. They were the ones who told us about 9/11 in time to stop it. They were the ones who told us that Iraq had no nuclear weapons program. When we invaded Iraq they gave us vital information about how to occupy an arab nation without much resistance and set up a peaceful democratic government. They were so competent that they predicted the October attack and prevented it.

They have been a big help to the USA in our nuclear nonproliferation program. If they had nuclear weapons, many other nations would be strongly tempted to get them too, particularly all their enemies. But they promised us that they would never be the first to introduce nuclear weapons to the middle east, and by keeping that promise they have helped us a lot.

Their effect on the UN has been entirely beneficial to us. Nobody could help us more there.

But apart from that they are a liability. It's true that the direct monetary aid we give them amounts to only about $500 per Jewish Israeli per year. Far less than we give our own welfare recipients. Only a quarter trillion dollars total so far. But when we give them our most advanced secret weapons and the plans that let them copy those weapons themselves, that amounts to a whole lot.

Maybe without our aid they would suffer significant casualities themselves, maybe even more than they dish out. So make sure that no Jewish Israeli has to live there. We don't owe it to them to make sure they can keep slaughtering people there, decade after decade.",2023-10-30T15:22:34+00:00

The US has funded a lot of the development of their own military industrial complex so the relationship is not just the US having a bud they give weapons to, but a bud that can create there own missiles and tanks and equipment. 

Then there is the ideological relationship, especially between religious people in the US and in Israel.

GreenParty,comment,Israel Defense Forces,k73rgl3,noirknight,,"What the US can do is take in refugees and provide aid to civilians if we can prove that the aid is going to people not involved with violence against Israel.

If this is politically unpalatable, pay other countries to take them. Most wealthy countries are facing labor shortages, they should welcome the youth of Gaza. All of the middle eastern countries that need to import labor like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and Bahrain would be preferable, but if not there, China, Japan or EU.  

A two state solution, at least while Hamas is in control of Gaza is an impossibility. I know Egypt doesn't want the Gaza strip, but Egyptian re-occupation might be one of the least bad options. Maybe UN occupation. This occupation would likely need to be on the order of 40 years and would require extensive rework of the educational and judicial systems to accept western ideas about right to self-determination and religious tolerance.

They kept all the goodies we had given them for a two-state solution.

The way it looks to me now, if we get a two-state ""solution"", with the Palestinians disarmed, within a few years Israel will invade again and the two-state solution will be over.

If we try a two-state solution where the Palestinians are allowed to get weapons, Israel will not agree to it and will invade immediately.

GreenParty,comment,Israel Defense Forces,k7660nz,jethomas5,,"You have a point.

But consider -- after the tragic ending of WWI in which Germans were starved into submission, Germans decided that they could not depend on good will or international agreements. They couldn't depend on anything but their own strength. So, ignoring international agreements and depending on their own strength, they eventually reached the point where almost the entire world was against them and they lost. They lost around 5 million soldiers dead or missing. Maybe half a million civilians dead by allied airstrikes. somewhere between half a million to 2 million dead among the German civilians ethnic-cleansed from eastern europe after the war. Half a million Germans killed by Nazis. And in the process they killed 6 million Jews.

After the war, many Jews realized that they could not depend on good will or international agreements. They couldn't depend on anything but their own strength. So, doing their best to manipulate international agreements and ignoring them when needed, they used their own strength to take enough land for their own nation. They eventually reached the point that almost the entire arab and/or muslim world was against them. It's only by superior technology that they survive, technology that in large part is provided by the USA. 

We did not protect the Jews from WWII. We could have done much more than we did, for example bomb the railroads that took Jews to the death camps. Don't we have a responsibility to them now? We let them crawl way out on a limb, do we saw it off behind them?

I say we ought to give every Jewish Israeli a US passport and Green card so they can come here and look for productive work. If they choose to stay in Israel and kill palestinians that's on them. But they should at least have a chance to turn their backs on that and live in peace here.",2023-10-31T01:18:13+00:00

We are their ally. They are not our ally. In the Gulf War, in the invasion of Iraq, etc have they ever helped us? No. It would have hurt us for them to help us, so we asked them not to. What good has their advanced military done us? When we help them it hurts our standing in the world, because we are basicly their only friend. 

> The US has funded a lot of the development of their own military industrial complex so the relationship is not just the US having a bud they give weapons to, but a bud that can create there own missiles and tanks and equipment.

GreenParty,comment,Israel Defense Forces,k78fzmi,jethomas5,,"I agree those are good things to do.

Now consider the likely results. Israelis are still suffering tremendous PTSD from the Holocaust. Americans went crazy for a few years after 9/11. Zionists lost 6 million people. How will they take losing all aid? The USA is basicly their only friend in the world, and they would stand alone.

One reason they have not confirmed that they have nukes is that the USA has promised to cut off aid to nations that have nukes. It would embarrass us to keep sending aid to Israel after we promised not to. If we cut off aid anyway, would they publicly threaten to nuke their enemies? 

Without the USA calling for moderation, would they proceed to exterminate palestinians? If we're what's stopping them now, what will we do when they don't care what we think?

They don't want to look like Nazis. But if they reach the point that the whole world is against them, and they must hold out the best they can until they are slaughtered, why wouldn't they act like Nazis? 

I don't want that to happen. Maybe the only choices are that they lord it over everyone, claiming they are the best fighters and no enemy can stand against them and they will take what they want, versus they get totally desperate and murderous. People with PTSD are not completely predictable, but maybe those choices are all that's available this time. I don't want either one. And it isn't clear whether there's anything we can do about that.

But I say, we should do what we can. There are a lot of Jewish Israelis who are stuck in Israel. Some of them came to Israel from arab countries where they weren't welcome, and they have nowhere else to go. When Russia allowed Jewish people to leave Russia, Israel demanded that the USA not accept very many of them so that a large number would have nowhere to go but Israel. I say it's better that Israelis who can accept peace, who don't insist on staying in Israel until Ragnarok, until Armageddon, should have a chance to get out.

And also it would be good for their victims to have a chance to get out.

> Once we enter the seats of public service, we will end all aid ($3.5 billion per year) to Israel

Hamas is a group that could negotiate, which the PLO cannot do. There won't be anybody else who can negotiate for Palestine for the foreseeable future. I don't know whether Hamas would negotiate peace, but if they did and they told Palestinians that they got the best deal they could, Palestinians would believe them. Nobody else could do it.

But of course Israel does not want peace. What they have now with each of their neighbors is like the Nazis had with Vichy France. They got a surrender and imposed terms. They can change the terms whenever they want to. With peace they would have to negotiate and whenever they wanted changes they would have to negotiate again.

I can’t vote for Biden again.,"My entire adult life I’ve registered independent, but always voted Democrat without hesitation. I’m definitely liberal leaning and I think protecting the environment needs to always be a top consideration when any decision is made. I’ve always loved the face value goals of the Green Party, but never fully committed because the presidential races have always felt very “good guy vs bad guy”. 

Hope this isn’t too controversial, but I’m appalled at the way Biden is blindly supporting Israel’s disproportionate and indiscriminate retaliation to Hamas, and by extension the people of Palestine. I cannot vote for Biden in good conscious. 

So, who is the green party’s 2024 presidential nominee? Is there an accurate and concise source for me to learn about the party’s position on the multitude of pressing issues in todays troubled world? What are the party’s general positions on topics like guns, abortions, police reform, lgbt rights, corporate tax reform, etc.?

Yes the duopoly loved presidential campaigns feeling that way because more people will vote for them rather than change. But I do think we're seeing major cracks and ""spoiler"" effect is having less impact on folks now that Biden is making it clear any differences Democrats had from Republicans are quickly disappearing.

>who is the green party’s 2024 presidential nominee?

None yet! The party follows a primary process just like any other party. The first primaries will occur sometime after the beginning of the year. The exact date depends on your state. I'd suggest contacting your state party for more information. See gp.org for more information.

>Is there an accurate and concise source for me to learn about the party’s position

The official party platform is at gp.org/platform which has all of the recent updates approved by the national committee. It's not very concise but it is separated by topics so you can scroll to the topic you want and read.

>What are the party’s general positions on topics like guns, abortions, police reform, lgbt rights, corporate tax reform

Read the platform for details but my summary would be:

Guns -- support basic reforms like background checks but also believe in self defense

Abortion -- unequivocally the party believes it is a right for the mother to choose healthcare including abortion

Police reform -- I believe the platform was updated to support 8 for abolition, the old platform was fairly weak and didn't say much

LGBTQ Rights -- yes full support for LGBTQ including trans rights. The party has a Lavender Caucus which represents LGBTQ members at the national level.

Corporate tax reform -- as part of the Green New Deal, there's a lot of tax changes that would happen but generally corporations pay more and families pay less, including establishing a negative income tax for low wages that would effectively create a universal basic income.

Speaking of, the Green New Deal was originally proposed over a decade ago by the Green Party, the platform was updated last year for a more comprehensive GND plan with a full budget proposal.",2023-10-26T00:42:06+00:00

I would like to expand on that a bit.

You will have noticed that many articles [like this one](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3532095-biden-can%e2%80%8b%e2%80%8bt-escape-questions-on-his-age/) have appeared in the past weeks. The liberal media and donors who connived to take out Bernie and put the bag of sawdust that is Joe Biden into the White House are now having buyer's remorse. Everyone is talking about how the combination of Biden's visible age, his lack of pizazz, and a continuing trend of bad economic news is paving the way for Trump to return.

You also see plenty of [news like this](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/06/trump-ashli-babbitt-christians), which confirms that the right wing continues to grow in numbers and in anger.

When you add in the all but certain loss of Congress to the GOP in November, the takeaway is obvious: the Dems are on the glide path to a historic humiliation in '24, and a tide of genuine fascism will certainly come with it.

LeftWingUK,post,Protest,f2tg6l,blackbirdonatautwire,Film showing on the french yellow vests on the 28th of February in London,"This month, in view of the ongoing events in France, Feminist Fightback will be showing two documentaries about the yellow vests in France.

The first is the short “A story of police violence in France” by Ross Domoney which tells the story of three lives affected by police violence in France during the Gilets Jaunes protests. The so-called “sub-lethal” riot control weapons used by French police against protesters have caused dozens of mutilations and serious injuries since the beginning of the movement. 

The second is the French 2019 documentary J’veux du soleil (A place in the sun) by [Gilles Perret](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2418217/?ref_=tt_ov_dr) and [François Ruffin](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7837906/?ref_=tt_ov_dr). J’veux du soleil is a road-movie, where the cinematographers travel the French countryside, meeting and talking to Gilets Jaunes on roundabouts and in their homes. The documentary lets the people speak for themselves and shows us the human stories behind the Gilets Jaunes movement.

LeftWingUK,post,Protest,4xj2dz,ShaunaDorothy,UK Court of Appeal sanctions mass disenfranchisement of Labour Party members,"By Robert Stevens and Chris Marsden 13 August 2016

The Court of Appeal (CoA) in London has handed down a politically motivated ruling supporting the Labour Party National Executive Committee (NEC) in excluding up to 150,000 members from voting in the upcoming leadership contest.

The ruling by Lord Justice Beatson, Lady Justice Macur and Lord Justice Sales overturns that handed down Monday in the High Court by Justice Hickinbottom that new members were entitled to a vote in the contest.

Hickinbottom’s ruling was made after five Labour Party members protested the NEC’s decision to exclude them and took legal action. The CoA ordered the five members to pay the Labour Party £30,000 in costs within 28 days. These include a person named only as FM, as he is under 18 years of age.

The NEC spent upwards of £200,000 of Labour’s subscription income in an operation designed to disenfranchise a broad swath of party members. The CoA ruling is a political decision backing the attempted coup by the Blairite right-wing of the party against leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was elected just 11 months ago on a platform of opposing austerity, militarism and war.

The right-wing on Labour’s NEC took the decision to impose a retrospective freeze date of January 12; meaning that those who joined after this date, up to July 12, would be prevented from voting. Given the wide support that Corbyn has among Labour members and supporters, the majority of those disenfranchised would be in favour of him remaining leader.

The plotters then stipulated that new members and supporters who wished to vote in the leadership election had to pay £25 (up from £3) during a two day window last month. In response, some 183,000 people paid up, generating income of £4.5 million, which the right-wing hope will contain a greater number ready to support leadership challenger Owen Smith—though indications are that most support Corbyn. In addition, 187 Constituency Labour Parties have so far nominated Corbyn to be leader, compared to just 27 for Smith.

The NEC, which has carried out this attack on democracy, has already been repudiated by the party’s membership. On Tuesday, it was announced that Corbyn’s supporters won all six positions up for grabs in the latest elections to the 33-member NEC—giving him a clear majority on the body.

Announcing the ruling, Lord Beatson said the panel unanimously decided that Hickenbottom “erred in law”. He said, “On the correct interpretation of the party rules, the national executive committee has the power to set the criteria for members to be eligible to vote in the leadership election in the way that it did.”

The appeal was in fact brought by the NEC’s “Procedures Committee,” which is charged with overseeing the leadership election process. It’s “Returning Officer” is the party’s general secretary and leading opponent of Corbyn, Iain McNichol. The five members sued McNichol as the representative of those who made the decision removing their right to vote.

The Procedures Committee challenge to Hickenbottom’s ruling was pushed through by another coup plotter, Labour deputy leader and red-baiter Tom Watson. Another member of the Committee is Margaret Beckett—widely despised for her ongoing support for the Iraq War and its co-architect, the indicted war criminal and former Labour leader Tony Blair. Another, Glenis Willmott MEP, is the chair of the European Parliamentary Labour Party. On June 29, Willmott signed a letter in the name of the majority of Labour’s 20 MEPs demanding that Corbyn resign. This followed the mass resignations by right-wingers from Corbyn’s Shadow Cabinet and a vote of no-confidence in him by 172 MPs—the overwhelming majority.

A central aim of the Blairites in attempting to remove Corbyn is the reversal of the June 23 referendum vote for the UK to leave the UK. Willmott’s letter stated, “We have very serious concerns in the light of Labour’s defeat in the referendum campaign.” She accused Corbyn, citing “an official Labour briefing document” that promoted “the Leave campaign” while Corbyn campaigned for a Remain vote. Owen Smith is pledged to hold a second referendum on EU membership.

In ruling for the NEC, the judiciary has now lined up behind a plot that has the backing of the UK and US intelligence services and is supported by the BBC, the Guardian and all sections of the media.

After ruling in favour of the five members and reluctantly granting the right to appeal, Hickenbottom warned, “I have taken the firm decision that the rules do not give the NEC the power to restrict the voting rights of members as it purported to do. I am not sure I am convinced that the contrary is arguable.”

Rule changes introduced by former Labour leader Ed Miliband, in place for several years, state that a major benefit of membership is the ability to vote in leadership elections. This was made clear on Labour’s web site to encourage people to sign up. Hickenbottom observed, “For the Party to refuse to allow the Claimants to vote in the current leadership election, because they have not been members since 12 January 2016, would be unlawful as in breach of contract.”

In contrast, on three occasions, the CoA judgement cited favourably obscure clauses and the rule books Appendices regarding the concern of the Labour apparatus with “entryism” and “packing of the party” with forces hostile to the party and its programme.

In his submission to the appeal, the NEC’s barrister, Clive Sheldon QC, cited Appendix 2 of the party’s rule book, which states, “The recruitment of large numbers of ‘paper members’, who have no wish to participate except at the behest of others in an attempt to manipulate party processes, undermines our democracy and is unacceptable to the party as a whole.”

Claiming there are “several problems” with Hickenbottom’s “approach to the contract in the Rule Book”, the CoA ruling says of a party with over 500,000 members, “The first is that it proceeds from an assumption that members have the right to vote... The rules do not, however, provide that all members can vote.” [emphasis added]

Following the verdict, WikiLeaks revealed that one of the CoA judges, Lord Justice Sales, has a clear conflict of interest as he was recruited as Junior Counsel to the Crown after Labour’s victory in the 1997 general election by Tony Blair himself. Justice Sales used to be a practising barrister at law firm 11KBW, the former chambers of Blair. In 2005, Sales legally defended the Labour government’s opposition to holding an inquiry into the Iraq war.

However, more is at stake here than personal connections. The judicial arm of the state has intervened to safeguard the Labour Party as a trusted political instrument of the state, and defend those who police it from any undue influence from its members.

This denial of the right to vote to a quarter of the party’s membership is proof that the working class has been wholly disenfranchised and has no means whatsoever of defending its interests either through parliament or the Labour Party. Yet even this does not rouse Corbyn to action, despite his declared aim of transforming Labour into a political voice for working people. Corbyn, who took time on Friday evening to congratulate the British Olympic teams’ cycling victory, made no pledge to fight this legal onslaught. What really motivates him is the defence of Labour’s grip on the working class.

Instead, a spokesman for Corbyn stated blandly, “We think that this is the wrong decision—both legally and democratically,” before making yet another appeal to the Blairites by pleading, “If we are to build a big, inclusive party to take on the Tories, we need to secure democracy in our party.”

“Soviet Workers: Defeat Yeltsin-Bush Counterrevolution!”

25 Years Ago

Twenty-five years ago, Boris Yeltsin’s ascension to power in the Soviet Union was a pivotal event leading to the restoration of capitalism in the home of the October Revolution. We reprint below excerpts from “Soviet Workers: Defeat Yeltsin-Bush Counterrevolution!” (WV No. 533, 30 August 1991), which was translated into Russian and circulated in over 100,000 copies throughout the USSR. As Trotskyists, we had always defended the Soviet Union against imperialism and internal counterrevolution because it was a workers state, based on a planned, collectivized economy. At the same time, we fought for proletarian political revolution to oust the Stalinist, nationalist caste sitting atop the workers state and to return to the internationalism and proletarian democracy of Lenin and Trotsky’s Bolsheviks.

In August 1991, there was a botched coup attempt by supposedly hardline opponents of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who was committed to the gradual reintroduction of capitalism while also pushing glasnost (openness). The coup plotters were no less committed to capitalist restoration; they merely sought to maintain the USSR as a unitary state (dominated by Russia). Seizing on this coup, U.S. imperialism (then led by the first President Bush) employed its stooge, Yeltsin, to mount a counterbid for power.

A month after the coup, we forthrightly stated: “In an armed struggle pitting outright restorationists against recalcitrant elements of the bureaucracy, defense of the collectivized economy would have been placed on the agenda whatever the Stalinists’ intentions” (WV No. 535, 27 September 1991). However, all wings of the bureaucracy proved equally bankrupt. As Bush openly backed Yeltsin and the petty-bourgeois rabble and fascistic scum supporting him, the pathetic coup plotters refused to lift a finger. They ignominiously collapsed within days.

When we issued the statement below, the proletarian state power had been fractured but not yet destroyed. The imperialist-installed Yeltsin regime was fragile and the working class had not moved. Ours was the first widely circulated piece of propaganda calling for workers action to smash the counterrevolutionary drive. We concretized this perspective through calling for independent workers committees to prevent layoffs and privatization by taking over control of production, for the formation of committees of soldiers and officers in the armed forces to prevent anti-Communist purges and the use of the army against the interests of the workers, and for multinational workers defense guards to ward off communalist massacres.

However, decades of Stalinist rule had systematically destroyed the consciousness of the Soviet working class, rendering it mute and passive. Under the anti-Marxist dogma of building “socialism in one country,” the Stalinist misrulers capitulated to the imperialists and suppressed numerous international revolutionary opportunities, for example, China in 1927, Spain in the 1930s and Italy following World War II. Through repression and lies they methodically attacked every aspect of the revolutionary and internationalist consciousness of the Soviet proletariat. Finally, with the bureaucracy having fatally undermined the Soviet economy through gross mismanagement and corruption, the heirs of Stalin proclaimed that socialized property had been a “failed experiment” and capitalism was really the only possible system. At the same time, the accompanying virulent nationalism was a huge impetus to counterrevolution in East Europe and the multinational Soviet Union.

As the document of the Second International Conference of the ICL in 1992 stated: “The events of August 1991, placing the forces of open capitalist restoration in the ascendancy in the Soviet Union, marked a turning point in contemporary world history. A piecemeal consolidation of this counterrevolution has taken place. The degenerated workers state of Stalin and his heirs has been destroyed, representing a world-historic defeat for the international working class” (“For the Communism of Lenin and Trotsky!” Spartacist [English-language edition] No. 47-48, Winter 1992-93).

The bourgeoisie and the bulk of its camp followers on the reformist left hailed the counterrevolution and proclaimed the “death of communism.” Meanwhile, the peoples of the former USSR were plunged into the most desperate poverty. U.S. imperialism, no longer challenged by Soviet military might, was emboldened to launch more wars and occupations against dependent and semicolonial peoples across the world.

Unevenly and not without contradictions, a rightward shift took place internationally, reflected in a retrogression in proletarian consciousness, wherein the connection between working-class struggle and the goals of socialism was severed. We in the ICL, the party of the Russian Revolution, continue the struggle to win the working class to Marxism in order to open the road to new Octobers.

The working people of the Soviet Union, and indeed the workers of the world, have suffered an unparalleled disaster whose devastating consequences are now being played out. The ascendancy of Boris Yeltsin, who offers himself as Bush’s man, coming off a botched coup by Mikhail Gorbachev’s former aides, has unleashed a counterrevolutionary tide across the land of the October Revolution. The first workers state in history, sapped and undermined by decades of Stalinist bureaucratic misrule, lies in tatters. The state power has been fractured, the Communist Party—its bureaucratic core—shattered and banned from the KGB and armed forces, the multinational union is ripping apart as one republic after another proclaims secession.

But while Yeltsin & Co. now see a clear field to push through a forced-draft reintroduction of capitalism, the outcome is not yet definitively decided. As the imperialists rejoice and the pro-capitalist petty bourgeoisie exult, Soviet workers are facing a disaster of catastrophic proportions: every gain for which they, their parents and grandparents sacrificed is on the chopping block. An explosion of even greater nationalist strife is looming. The lash of capitalist exploitation being introduced amid universal economic dislocation threatens widespread hunger and mass unemployment in the coming winter. The Soviet proletariat, whose capacity for militant action was dramatically shown in the miners strike of the summer of 1989, has not been heard from. Opposition from the factories against the ravages of capitalist assault could throw a giant wrench in the works and prevent the rapid consolidation of counterrevolution.

Soviet Stalinism has breathed its pathetic last gasp. Even up to the coup, many of the most advanced workers, who opposed Yeltsin’s plans for wholesale privatization and Gorbachev’s market reforms, looked to the so-called hardline “patriotic” wing of the bureaucracy. There is no room anymore for such illusions.

The coup’s collapse and the ascendancy of counterrevolution in the Soviet Union buttresses, for the present moment, Bush’s proclaimed “New World Order” militarily dominated by the U.S. Following its annihilation of Iraq, the triumphalist and vengeful American ruling class threatens to turn its wrath, unrestrained by the deterrent of a powerful USSR, against myriad peoples of the world. Cuba, in particular, is in Bush’s cross hairs, and its defense is more than ever a duty of all opponents of Yankee imperialism.

From the time of Stalin’s bureaucratic usurpation of power in 1924, Leon Trotsky and the Left Opposition waged an unrelenting fight for the internationalist program of the Bolshevik Revolution. Under the deadly blows of Stalinist terror and slander, the Trotskyists persevered as the best and only consistent defenders of the remaining revolutionary gains. Today the International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist) continues this struggle.

Stalinism was the political rule of a bureaucratic caste parasitically sitting atop the proletarian property forms created by the October Revolution of 1917. Whether during the bloody purges of the 1930s or the myriad “reforms” from Khrushchev and others, this system based on lies and repression of the working class not only blocked further progress toward socialism but clogged every pore of Soviet society. After decades of self-sacrifice extracted from the proletariat in the name of building “socialism in one country,” Gorbachev’s perestroika was the last desperate attempt of the Stalinist bureaucracy to preserve its position by adopting capitalist measures. But like Nikolai Bukharin’s appeals to the rich peasants (kulaks) in the late 1920s to “enrich yourselves,” perestroika fueled the forces of capitalist restoration which have now reached their fruition with Yeltsin’s countercoup.

Boris Yeltsin is not a “Westernizer”—he is an extreme Russian chauvinist who intends to sell out the Soviet Union to the West. He is connected to a far-right, racist outfit in the U.S. called the “Free Congress Foundation” (whose East European operatives include notorious Nazi collaborators) which takes credit for “training” him and his staff on how to seize power. His laws are being drawn up by advisers supplied by the U.S. government. One of Yeltsin’s first acts as Moscow party chief in the mid ’80s was to legitimize the anti-Semitic Pamyat fascists when they emerged from their ratholes. While he promises working people that the free market will bring them prosperity, in fact it will lead to the elimination of what every Soviet worker considered a right until recently: a stable job, free health care, an education for their children—gains which all rest on the collectivized economy.

The alternatives posed before the Soviet bureaucratically degenerated workers state have always been: counterrevolution or Trotskyism. Today Stalinism is dead. The key to frustrating the bloody plans of Bush, Yeltsin and their counterrevolutionary cohorts is the early forging of a Trotskyist nucleus in the Soviet Union, regrouping those elements in the workers movement, the army and throughout society who would fight for the program of October....

Fight Capitalist Enslavement!

For decades, the Stalinists and imperialists have joined together in identifying the system of bureaucratic rule installed by Stalin and his henchmen in 1924 with Leninism. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Bolsheviks under Lenin and Trotsky carried out the October Revolution as the first step of the world socialist revolution. Backward Russia, the “weak link” of imperialist rule, was the scene of the first workers revolution, but it had to be completed by the proletariat in the advanced imperialist countries if it was to sustain itself and lead to socialism, a society of equality based on abundance. It was on the basis of the defeat of the European revolutions, centrally in Germany, in the 1918-23 postwar period, that the usurpers Stalin/Bukharin “discovered” the profoundly anti-Marxist notion that it was possible to construct “socialism in one country.” Trotsky denounced this nationalist dogma as writing off the world revolution, and predicted it would be the undoing of the Soviet Union if the bureaucracy was not swept away by the resurgent working class.

In his decisive analysis of Stalinism, The Revolution Betrayed (1937), Trotsky asked prophetically, “Will the bureaucrat devour the workers’ state, or will the working class clean up the bureaucrat?” In developing this, he elaborated the program of proletarian political revolution led by a Bolshevik party to re-establish Soviet democracy. The planned economy would be subordinated to the will of the workers, freeing it from the arbitrary zigzags of the faceless, grey bureaucrats. And instead of the conservative anti-revolutionary policies of Stalin’s Kremlin, the Soviet Union would again become the headquarters of international socialist revolution. He also spelled out the bleak alternative:

“If—to adopt a second hypothesis—a bourgeois party were to overthrow the ruling Soviet caste, it would find no small number of ready servants among the present bureaucrats, administrators, technicians, directors, party secretaries and privileged upper circles in general. A purgation of the state apparatus would, of course, be necessary in this case too. But a bourgeois restoration would probably have to clean out fewer people than a revolutionary party. The chief task of the new power would be to restore private property in the means of production. First of all, it would be necessary to create conditions for the development of strong farmers from the weak collective farms, and for converting the strong collectives into producers’ cooperatives of the bourgeois type—into agricultural stock companies. In the sphere of industry, denationalization would begin with the light industries and those producing food. The planning principle would be converted for the transitional period into a series of compromises between state power and individual ‘corporations’—potential proprietors, that is, among the Soviet captains of industry, the émigré former proprietors and foreign capitalists. Notwithstanding that the Soviet bureaucracy has gone far toward preparing a bourgeois restoration, the new regime would have to introduce in the matter of forms of property and methods of industry not a reform, but a social revolution.”

Every Soviet worker, collective farmer, pensioner and soldier will immediately recognize that this process of counterrevolution is well under way. The state monopoly of foreign trade has been scuttled, the planned economy abandoned. In their stead, imperialist corporations from Pepsi-Cola to Chevron oil have made encroachments on the Soviet economy. The Russian federation’s new “land reform” lays the basis for destroying the kolkhoz collectives, promising rural poverty for the many and riches for the new kulaks. “Cooperative” profiteers and black market speculators have grown explosively in the vacuum of the collapsed distribution system. But this is only the beginning. Yeltsin now intends to ram through capitalist restoration at breakneck pace. Yavlinsky, co-author of the Harvard-designed “grand bargain” to sell out the Soviet Union to the imperialists, is now in charge of the economy. But for the Soviet working masses, the “magic of the marketplace” holds the promise of hunger and homelessness....

We Trotskyists Have Defended the Soviet Union

Today the Soviet Union faces being dismembered and its constituent republics turned into neocolonies of Washington, Berlin and Tokyo. The present collapse of the Stalinist bureaucracy has its immediate origins in the renewed Cold War offensive launched by American imperialism after its ignominious defeat in Vietnam. In every key battleground of Cold War II—Afghanistan, Poland, the German Democratic Republic (DDR)—the International Communist League (ICL, formerly the international Spartacist tendency) has stood resolutely in defense of the Soviet Union against the capitulation of the Kremlin bureaucracy.

Where the Soviet Stalinists waged a halfhearted war against CIA-armed Islamic reactionaries in Afghanistan, ultimately selling out and withdrawing, we said “Hail Red Army in Afghanistan!” and called to “Extend Social Gains of the October Revolution to the Afghan Peoples!” When in late 1981 Polish Solidarność, under the guidance of Reagan and Pope John Paul Wojtyla, made a bid for power in the name of “bourgeois democracy,” we raised the call: “Stop Solidarność Counterrevolution!” General Jaruzelski’s countercoup temporarily spiked these clerical-nationalist front men for Wall Street and Washington. But the Stalinists had neither the moral authority nor the program to undercut counterrevolution, and eight years later the same Jaruzelski, with Gorbachev’s approval, abdicated political power to Walesa & Co.

When in late 1989 the Honecker regime in East Germany fell and the Berlin Wall was opened, the ICL threw its forces into the fight for the perspective of a red Germany of workers councils. We initiated the call for the giant Treptow anti-fascist demonstration of 3 January 1990, which drew 250,000 people to honor the Soviet soldiers who died liberating Germany from the Nazis. Then, as Gorbachev gave the green light to a reunified Fourth Reich of German imperialism, our comrades of the Spartakist Workers Party of Germany were the only party which clearly and unambiguously opposed capitalist reunification.

Within the Soviet Union representatives of the ICL have fought for a revolutionary internationalist perspective. Thus at a coal miners congress last October in Donetsk, we helped block the effort of right-wing, Yeltsinite forces advised by the American “AFL-CIA” federation to enlist Soviet miners in the international anti-Communist witchhunt against British miners leader Arthur Scargill. The imperialist rulers hate Scargill because he led the 1984-85 British miners strike—which Soviet workers generously aided. This momentous class battle gave the lie to the self-serving Stalinist myth that workers in advanced capitalist countries are incapable of hard-fought class struggle.

We urgently seek to bring the program of Trotskyism to the Soviet proletariat and socialist-minded intelligentsia with our Russian-language Spartacist Bulletin, containing in addition to key documents of the ICL the section on the USSR from Trotsky’s Transitional Program.

U.S. imperialism, no longer challenged by Soviet military might, was emboldened to launch more wars and occupations against dependent and semicolonial peoples across the world.

Unevenly and not without contradictions, a rightward shift took place internationally, reflected in a retrogression in proletarian consciousness, wherein the connection between working-class struggle and the goals of socialism was severed. We in the ICL, the party of the Russian Revolution, continue the struggle to win the working class to Marxism in order to open the road to new Octobers.

The working people of the Soviet Union, and indeed the workers of the world, have suffered an unparalleled disaster whose devastating consequences are now being played out. The ascendancy of Boris Yeltsin, who offers himself as Bush’s man, coming off a botched coup by Mikhail Gorbachev’s former aides, has unleashed a counterrevolutionary tide across the land of the October Revolution. The first workers state in history, sapped and undermined by decades of Stalinist bureaucratic misrule, lies in tatters. The state power has been fractured, the Communist Party—its bureaucratic core—shattered and banned from the KGB and armed forces, the multinational union is ripping apart as one republic after another proclaims secession.

But while Yeltsin & Co. now see a clear field to push through a forced-draft reintroduction of capitalism, the outcome is not yet definitively decided. As the imperialists rejoice and the pro-capitalist petty bourgeoisie exult, Soviet workers are facing a disaster of catastrophic proportions: every gain for which they, their parents and grandparents sacrificed is on the chopping block. An explosion of even greater nationalist strife is looming. The lash of capitalist exploitation being introduced amid universal economic dislocation threatens widespread hunger and mass unemployment in the coming winter. The Soviet proletariat, whose capacity for militant action was dramatically shown in the miners strike of the summer of 1989, has not been heard from. Opposition from the factories against the ravages of capitalist assault could throw a giant wrench in the works and prevent the rapid consolidation of counterrevolution.

Soviet Stalinism has breathed its pathetic last gasp. Even up to the coup, many of the most advanced workers, who opposed Yeltsin’s plans for wholesale privatization and Gorbachev’s market reforms, looked to the so-called hardline “patriotic” wing of the bureaucracy. There is no room anymore for such illusions.

The coup’s collapse and the ascendancy of counterrevolution in the Soviet Union buttresses, for the present moment, Bush’s proclaimed “New World Order” militarily dominated by the U.S. Following its annihilation of Iraq, the triumphalist and vengeful American ruling class threatens to turn its wrath, unrestrained by the deterrent of a powerful USSR, against myriad peoples of the world. Cuba, in particular, is in Bush’s cross hairs, and its defense is more than ever a duty of all opponents of Yankee imperialism.

From the time of Stalin’s bureaucratic usurpation of power in 1924, Leon Trotsky and the Left Opposition waged an unrelenting fight for the internationalist program of the Bolshevik Revolution. Under the deadly blows of Stalinist terror and slander, the Trotskyists persevered as the best and only consistent defenders of the remaining revolutionary gains. Today the International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist) continues this struggle.

Stalinism was the political rule of a bureaucratic caste parasitically sitting atop the proletarian property forms created by the October Revolution of 1917. Whether during the bloody purges of the 1930s or the myriad “reforms” from Khrushchev and others, this system based on lies and repression of the working class not only blocked further progress toward socialism but clogged every pore of Soviet society. After decades of self-sacrifice extracted from the proletariat in the name of building “socialism in one country,” Gorbachev’s perestroika was the last desperate attempt of the Stalinist bureaucracy to preserve its position by adopting capitalist measures. But like Nikolai Bukharin’s appeals to the rich peasants (kulaks) in the late 1920s to “enrich yourselves,” perestroika fueled the forces of capitalist restoration which have now reached their fruition with Yeltsin’s countercoup.

Boris Yeltsin is not a “Westernizer”—he is an extreme Russian chauvinist who intends to sell out the Soviet Union to the West. He is connected to a far-right, racist outfit in the U.S. called the “Free Congress Foundation” (whose East European operatives include notorious Nazi collaborators) which takes credit for “training” him and his staff on how to seize power. His laws are being drawn up by advisers supplied by the U.S. government. One of Yeltsin’s first acts as Moscow party chief in the mid ’80s was to legitimize the anti-Semitic Pamyat fascists when they emerged from their ratholes. While he promises working people that the free market will bring them prosperity, in fact it will lead to the elimination of what every Soviet worker considered a right until recently: a stable job, free health care, an education for their children—gains which all rest on the collectivized economy.

The alternatives posed before the Soviet bureaucratically degenerated workers state have always been: counterrevolution or Trotskyism. Today Stalinism is dead. The key to frustrating the bloody plans of Bush, Yeltsin and their counterrevolutionary cohorts is the early forging of a Trotskyist nucleus in the Soviet Union, regrouping those elements in the workers movement, the army and throughout society who would fight for the program of October....

Fight Capitalist Enslavement!

For decades, the Stalinists and imperialists have joined together in identifying the system of bureaucratic rule installed by Stalin and his henchmen in 1924 with Leninism. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Bolsheviks under Lenin and Trotsky carried out the October Revolution as the first step of the world socialist revolution. Backward Russia, the “weak link” of imperialist rule, was the scene of the first workers revolution, but it had to be completed by the proletariat in the advanced imperialist countries if it was to sustain itself and lead to socialism, a society of equality based on abundance. It was on the basis of the defeat of the European revolutions, centrally in Germany, in the 1918-23 postwar period, that the usurpers Stalin/Bukharin “discovered” the profoundly anti-Marxist notion that it was possible to construct “socialism in one country.” Trotsky denounced this nationalist dogma as writing off the world revolution, and predicted it would be the undoing of the Soviet Union if the bureaucracy was not swept away by the resurgent working class.

In his decisive analysis of Stalinism, The Revolution Betrayed (1937), Trotsky asked prophetically, “Will the bureaucrat devour the workers’ state, or will the working class clean up the bureaucrat?” In developing this, he elaborated the program of proletarian political revolution led by a Bolshevik party to re-establish Soviet democracy. The planned economy would be subordinated to the will of the workers, freeing it from the arbitrary zigzags of the faceless, grey bureaucrats. And instead of the conservative anti-revolutionary policies of Stalin’s Kremlin, the Soviet Union would again become the headquarters of international socialist revolution. He also spelled out the bleak alternative:

“If—to adopt a second hypothesis—a bourgeois party were to overthrow the ruling Soviet caste, it would find no small number of ready servants among the present bureaucrats, administrators, technicians, directors, party secretaries and privileged upper circles in general. A purgation of the state apparatus would, of course, be necessary in this case too. But a bourgeois restoration would probably have to clean out fewer people than a revolutionary party. The chief task of the new power would be to restore private property in the means of production. First of all, it would be necessary to create conditions for the development of strong farmers from the weak collective farms, and for converting the strong collectives into producers’ cooperatives of the bourgeois type—into agricultural stock companies. In the sphere of industry, denationalization would begin with the light industries and those producing food. The planning principle would be converted for the transitional period into a series of compromises between state power and individual ‘corporations’—potential proprietors, that is, among the Soviet captains of industry, the émigré former proprietors and foreign capitalists. Notwithstanding that the Soviet bureaucracy has gone far toward preparing a bourgeois restoration, the new regime would have to introduce in the matter of forms of property and methods of industry not a reform, but a social revolution.”

Every Soviet worker, collective farmer, pensioner and soldier will immediately recognize that this process of counterrevolution is well under way. The state monopoly of foreign trade has been scuttled, the planned economy abandoned. In their stead, imperialist corporations from Pepsi-Cola to Chevron oil have made encroachments on the Soviet economy. The Russian federation’s new “land reform” lays the basis for destroying the kolkhoz collectives, promising rural poverty for the many and riches for the new kulaks. “Cooperative” profiteers and black market speculators have grown explosively in the vacuum of the collapsed distribution system. But this is only the beginning. Yeltsin now intends to ram through capitalist restoration at breakneck pace. Yavlinsky, co-author of the Harvard-designed “grand bargain” to sell out the Soviet Union to the imperialists, is now in charge of the economy. But for the Soviet working masses, the “magic of the marketplace” holds the promise of hunger and homelessness....

We Trotskyists Have Defended the Soviet Union

Today the Soviet Union faces being dismembered and its constituent republics turned into neocolonies of Washington, Berlin and Tokyo. The present collapse of the Stalinist bureaucracy has its immediate origins in the renewed Cold War offensive launched by American imperialism after its ignominious defeat in Vietnam. In every key battleground of Cold War II—Afghanistan, Poland, the German Democratic Republic (DDR)—the International Communist League (ICL, formerly the international Spartacist tendency) has stood resolutely in defense of the Soviet Union against the capitulation of the Kremlin bureaucracy.

Where the Soviet Stalinists waged a halfhearted war against CIA-armed Islamic reactionaries in Afghanistan, ultimately selling out and withdrawing, we said “Hail Red Army in Afghanistan!” and called to “Extend Social Gains of the October Revolution to the Afghan Peoples!” When in late 1981 Polish Solidarność, under the guidance of Reagan and Pope John Paul Wojtyla, made a bid for power in the name of “bourgeois democracy,” we raised the call: “Stop Solidarność Counterrevolution!” General Jaruzelski’s countercoup temporarily spiked these clerical-nationalist front men for Wall Street and Washington. But the Stalinists had neither the moral authority nor the program to undercut counterrevolution, and eight years later the same Jaruzelski, with Gorbachev’s approval, abdicated political power to Walesa & Co.

When in late 1989 the Honecker regime in East Germany fell and the Berlin Wall was opened, the ICL threw its forces into the fight for the perspective of a red Germany of workers councils. We initiated the call for the giant Treptow anti-fascist demonstration of 3 January 1990, which drew 250,000 people to honor the Soviet soldiers who died liberating Germany from the Nazis. Then, as Gorbachev gave the green light to a reunified Fourth Reich of German imperialism, our comrades of the Spartakist Workers Party of Germany were the only party which clearly and unambiguously opposed capitalist reunification.

Within the Soviet Union representatives of the ICL have fought for a revolutionary internationalist perspective. Thus at a coal miners congress last October in Donetsk, we helped block the effort of right-wing, Yeltsinite forces advised by the American “AFL-CIA” federation to enlist Soviet miners in the international anti-Communist witchhunt against British miners leader Arthur Scargill. The imperialist rulers hate Scargill because he led the 1984-85 British miners strike—which Soviet workers generously aided. This momentous class battle gave the lie to the self-serving Stalinist myth that workers in advanced capitalist countries are incapable of hard-fought class struggle.

We urgently seek to bring the program of Trotskyism to the Soviet proletariat and socialist-minded intelligentsia with our Russian-language Spartacist Bulletin, containing in addition to key documents of the ICL the section on the USSR from Trotsky’s Transitional Program.

>Gaza resident Ibrahim Yaghi has told Al Jazeera his neighbourhood has been under constant bombardment by Israeli forces since this morning, spreading fear across the besieged territory.

Obviously civilians are often terrified and what they say might reflect how they are pereceiving things more than being factually accurate. I've seen some unverified pictures that certainly don't look like surgical strikes. Will have to wait to see actual verified info though. 

Israel in the past has happily murdered thousands of civilians as retaliation for crimes of armed groups that have killed far less ([2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War)). 

Also bombing a terrorist training camp and happening to kill someone passing by is not the same as just blowing up buildings in residential areas and saying ""there were terrorists there"" as if that justifies the act + any other deaths caused. Some of Israel's explanations in the past haave been a lot closer to the latter than the former. And the current explanation is going along those lines

>Israel’s air force has said its fighter jets have struck two high-rise buildings in Gaza, saying they housed Hamas “military infrastructure”.

>The announcement came shortly after an Israeli attack on the Palestine Tower in Gaza City was captured as Youmna ElSayed was reporting live for Al Jazeera.

>“The Air Force attacked two military infrastructures of senior members of the terrorist organization Hamas inside high-rise buildings,” the Israeli Air Force said, without providing the exact location.

>The Air Force statement said, “Hamas places its military assets in the heart of the civilian population in the Gaza Strip.”

If you have seen the clip of that reporter where the tower gets blown up behind her from today here is what they say about that

>Al Jazeera’s Youma ElSayed says the tower that was just hit behind her by an Israeli missile was a residential building.

>ElSayed was reporting live when the missile struck.

>One of its apartments was previously targeted in August 2022, killing Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Taysir al-Jabari.

>“But this time, the building was totally destroyed and brought to the ground. Looking at all the buildings adjacent to it, you can imagine the amount of destruction that is in [the vicinity]. And this is point, I’ve been saying over and over: The Gaza Strip is a very densely populated area,” she said.


So chances of Israel having only carried out surgical strikes on confirmed armed militants associated with the attacks on Israel today, also with minimal civilian casualties, seems quite low. Although we definitely will have to wait to see the full story.",2023-10-07T16:32:51+00:00

Hamas exists for the reason of fighting back against the things that Israel are doing. If there was no Israel there would be no Hamas. that one causes the other is clear.  If you want to read a history book the Israeli grooming of Hamas is well established.

border status, they share religion and are former allies, there really should be no issues here, all that needs to be achieved for the blockade to end is Egypt to trust that opening the boarder won’t imperil civilians or officials and the blockade ends.

LabourUK,comment,Pro-Israel,k4yi0ee,Blue_winged_yoshi,,"The whole concept of Jewish people being settlers or colonisers is fucked up in the extreme. Never in thousands of years of history have non-Jewish people ever considered Jewish people to be living in the right place unless it’s 6 feet under ground. We’ve been shunted round the world endlessly always in the wrong place, always ripe for expulsion and/or genocide. 

For Jews living in Israel who weren’t there pre-1940s, was it legitimate to expel Jewish people from Arab states or to genocide Jewish people in Europe. History is horrible. Unless you think there’s gonna be 150,000 Jewish people’s descendents moving back to Iran with another trenche moving back to Iraq, mass migration back to Morocco, Algeria, Egypt and others with millions back to eastern and Central Europe and still a lot of folks in Israel anyway any time soon (and be real here), it is what it is. There isn’t anywhere for Jewish Israelis to go and nowhere that would be considered “legitimate”, but there they are. Jewish people in Israel did not win 20th century history by any metric, and they aren’t about move on. 

So back to the real world and your point. Hamas aren’t a result of Israel, warfare was chosen by Palestine and Israel is as legitimate as any nation state (probably not very, nation states are a problematic concept), but no less legitimate than any other either. The best time to negotiate two stable, peaceful and prosperous states was 1947, the second best time is now. 

Choosing warfare and rejecting Israel’s legitimacy has ironically only lost Palestine land and made lives harder to live. It’s long past time both sides acknowledged each other’s legitimacy and came to a lasting peace. Hamas and the Israeli far right want forever war, both believe that one day they will win. It’s imperative that a middle ground emerges from this that can talk respectfully, negotiate and come to agreements amicably - through this the extreme edges will see their power bases diminish. It’s long past time to choose peace.",2023-10-15T09:48:19+00:00
LabourUK,comment,Pro-Israel,k4wjmnv,keravim,,"Yes. For a two state solution to work you need all of the Israeli changes in how they treat non-Jewish people, a return of land, and a building of Palestine infrastructure. Additionally, Palestine would still be a geographically split state which would always cause major issues.

I'm by no means saying this would be quick or easy, but at this point arguing for a two state solution is not much more than giving cover to the fact that you're not meaningfully asking for Israel to change, and without that demand there is no path to peace",2023-10-14T22:39:36+00:00

No reasonable person is calling for all jewish people to leave and that should never be the case. But while there is set up one jewish ethnostate competing against and excluding the other people who live there there will never be peace. The two state solution  has always meant a strong Israel that kills and displaces rather than peace.   


peace talks need to include equal rights and security for both sides. and that's going to have to mean allowing Palestinians back into the areas they have been excluded from and both groups living amongst each other.",2023-10-15T10:26:45+00:00
LabourUK,comment,Pro-Israel,k4ymlvk,Blue_winged_yoshi,,"There are three end games on the table. One state Israel, one state Palestine and two-states. This is it. One state palestine and one state Israel will both be ethnostates with severe consequences for minority populations. 

Look at Hamas’s plans for Palestine they are every bit as awful as the far right wants for Israel. In Palestine LGBT+ people have no rights and are commonly murdered in the streets to no punishment, laws are based on Sharia law and Palestine is to be a Muslim nation. It’s would be an ethnostate too. Hard reality? Most nation states globally are ethnostates. 

The term gets hurled at Israel perjorativey with no real critical reflection of how most nation states globally and every nation state within a thousand miles is an ethnostate - see previous comment, sizeable Jewish populations were removed from other Arab states to create homogenous Muslim nations. 

So what is the least worst option? Two states side by side, independent, prosperous and free. 

Neither state will be a liberal utopia, Palestine will be a sharia law governed Shia state in the same vogue as Iran, Israel will be a PR democracy with far-right king-makers bent and a sizeable religious vote - more like a very extreme Florida with slightly better LGBT+ rights, but they both need to have the space to exist in peace. 

The core of the unsolveability of Israel/Palestine has been that the the lack of sincere negotiations, compromise and mutual respect of legitimacy from those who aren’t extremists. Hamas and Likud are two sides of the same coin, both are content with chaos and forever war. There needs to be a new and more powerful linking political of the PLO, the Israeli left and all international people who care to hash out agreement for two nation states and then to pressure the extremes to acceptance. 

I’m so tired of the cycles of violence, warfare and atrocities, I’m tired of crap one-sided analysises being used to oversimplify the issue and reduce it to point scoring within an unwinnable game. Nothing good will likely come of this horrendous situation, but the above is the only turn-off available, it needs to be take one day, today works well for me.",2023-10-15T10:49:08+00:00
LabourUK,comment,Pro-Israel,k4yun92,Street-Present5102,,"The two state solution is not the least worse option and has never been on the table becauase israel hates the palestinian people, will never see them as equal and views the whole of the land as theirs. Whenever there has been agreement to work towards a 2 state solution israel has always continued to kill and settle more land. 

This cycle of warfare exists being israel is creating an ethnostate on an already populated area. This is textbook settler colonialism : ""Settler colonialism occurs when foreign settlers arrive in an already inhabited territory to permanently inhabit it and found a new society. Intrinsically connected to this is the displacement or elimination of existing residents and destruction of their society.""

LabourUK,comment,Pro-Israel,k4zpjpq,Blue_winged_yoshi,,"Your analysis is just straight up wrong. A two state solution was on the table from the beginning - indeed it was the plan - it was rejected because Palestine thought that through warfare they could have it all. You can’t just pretend that this wasn’t the case to sure up an argument. Engage with the facts not what you want the facts to be.

Further this is not settler colonialism or colonialism of any kind. There is not mighty Israeli empire from which settlers are being sent to found new colonies, like say New Zealand literally was (founded about 50 or so years earlier than Israel after a huge genocide btw). Jewish people have always been in Israel, Jewish people have always been shunted around across the Middle East and Europe. It simply isn’t accurate to equate this group to colonialism in the same way that were the Kurds to get a nation state, it would be preposterous to call Kurdistan settler colonialism.

Finally Israel is multiethnic. Israel is considerably more diverse than the U.K. is and worlds apart from anywhere else in the Middle East. Israel is about 70% Jewish we are about 90% white British. Jews in Israel are very diverse comprising Ashkenazi Jews as well as Jews from across North Africa and the Middle East as well as Arabs, Christians and people of other ethnicities. You’ve just read the word ethnostate one too many times without knowing anything about Israel!

You’re playing this game on easy by only talking to people who agree with you and that’s leaving you repeating unthought-through clichés without actually knowing key facts.

I get it looks very clumsy and stupid, but it astounds me how uncritically everyone is looking at this interview and at these questions in particular that are repeated ad nauseum when the guest has a whiff of being even mildly sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinian people.

Putting Corbyn aside for a second, there is a reason why every single interview focused on the suffering of the people in Gaza starts with questions like these: ""Do you condemn Hamas?!"", ""Do you support Hamas?!"" , ""Does Israel have a right to defend itself?!"" , ""Does Israel have a right to exist?!"".

These are not honest questions. Realistically, no one, even if they do sincerely feel like that Hamas is a liberation army and not a terrorist group, is going to come out on TV and say that they openly support a terrorist organisation. That would probably trigger a criminal prosecution, so of course it is an idiotic and pointless question to ask. No one is going to openly say on TV that they feel the state of Israel should be wiped out of the map. These questions are not even a checklist of how much of a ""goodie"" or ""baddie"" you are. They are not meant to put pressure on your guest, they are not meant to get any truth out of anyone, they are not meant to contextualise anything. It is not as if any interview with an Israeli spokesperson begins with ""How much longer is Israel going to flout international law?"". Or ""Why is there no condemnation for the ever expanding Israeli settlements?"". Or ""How many Palestinian lives are worth an Israeli life'?"". What these questions (that only really flow towards one side of the argument) are designed to do is to suck out the oxygen of *any* pro Palestinian argument. They are meant for the guest to waste all their on air time assuring everyone that they are a good guy, totally supportive of Israel first and foremost, who just happen to have a few concerns. They are meant to force you to toe the line.

Now back to Corbyn, he is obviously trying desperately hard to not fall into this game. He is just way too clumsy and slow to figure out a way to get out of it and, in turn, just gets tangled even further into this web. If anything, there have been many examples already of guests turning the argument on its head. Corbyn simply doesn't have that ability to quickly turn an argument inside out.

But the question here is not why he can't give a straight answer to these nonsensical questions. The question here is why we as an audience need to put up with this fucking asymmetrical mindgames",2023-11-14T10:09:33+00:00

LabourUK,comment,Hamas,k96sr49,secondofly,,"I am not sure it is useful to label Hamas a terrorist organisation (though in general I'm not sure how useful ""terrorist"" is as a designation, but anyway). Doing so puts them in the same category as Isis or Al-Qaeda, when I don't really think that explains the conditions of their emergence, which is part of an anti-colonial struggle for a dispossessed people. This does not make them inherently good, and saying I don't think they're terrorists doesn't mean they're good either - obviously they are very bad. It just means thinking pretty deeply about the kind of organisation they are. There was a piece in the FT I found useful in terms of who they are, which described them as more like the Vietcong than Isis. I think that is a more useful rubric toward properly understanding what they are.

Edit: I don't see a major problem really with his refusal to answer the question, just wish he'd said ""define what you mean by a terror group"" or ""I'm not sure its useful to keep calling them terrorists if you want long lasting peace"" or even ""no, but that doesn't mean I think what they did on October 7th wasn't a war crime""

Edit 2: I would really like someone to engage with me on this rather than silently downvoting because I don't understand why saying this seems to be a red line - what do we actually gain by insisting that Hamas are a terrorist organisation? How does that help to create peace, to allow Palestinians and Israelis to live together on the same land, to end the cycle of violence?

>The Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza had proposed a three-phase deal, each lasting 45 days, that would also see the gradual release of hostages held in the enclave in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel – including those serving life sentences – as well as the start of a massive humanitarian and rebuilding effort.

>Contrary to earlier demands, Hamas did not call for an immediate end to the war. Negotiations for a permanent ceasefire would take place during the truce and the remaining hostages would only be released once a final deal to end the war was agreed, the document said.

>>Under Hamas’ counterproposal, the first phase of the ceasefire would have included the release of hostages in Gaza including women and children under 19 years old who aren’t enlisted in the Israeli military, as well as the elderly and the sick, in exchange for all Palestinian female, juvenile, sick and elderly Palestinian prisoners as well as 500 prisoners named by Hamas, including those with life sentences and convictions for serious crimes.

The deal isn't for a ceasefire,it is for a truce where a actual ceasefire will have to be negociated,and it doesn't said whether the truce itself will allow for any hostage release.

Also,the deal wouldn't see the hostage release immedently and said that there will be negociation during the truce and all hostage will only be release once ""a final deal"" has been reach(AKA Hamas could break their word at any moment and doesn't released any hostage,which mean Israel will be putting itself at a extreme disadvantage since it would have to start withdrawing first)

Plus,they want Israel to release a bunch of prisoner for it including FIVE HUNDRED terrorist of Hamas own choice.

>The Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza had proposed a three-phase deal, each lasting 45 days, that would also see the gradual release of hostages held in the enclave in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel – including those serving life sentences – as well as the start of a massive humanitarian and rebuilding effort.

>Contrary to earlier demands, Hamas did not call for an immediate end to the war. Negotiations for a permanent ceasefire would take place during the truce and the remaining hostages would only be released once a final deal to end the war was agreed, the document said.

>>Under Hamas’ counterproposal, the first phase of the ceasefire would have included the release of hostages in Gaza including women and children under 19 years old who aren’t enlisted in the Israeli military, as well as the elderly and the sick, in exchange for all Palestinian female, juvenile, sick and elderly Palestinian prisoners as well as 500 prisoners named by Hamas, including those with life sentences and convictions for serious crimes.

The deal wouldn't see the hostage release immedently and said that there will be negociation during the truce and all hostage will only be release once ""a final deal"" has been reach(AKA Hamas could break their word at any moment and doesn't released any hostage,which mean Israel will be putting itself at a extreme disadvantage)

Also,they want Israel to release a bunch of prisoner for it including FIVE HUNDRED terrorist of Hamas own choice.

And let me remind you that the current Hamas chief in Gaza used to be a Israeli prisoner until [he was exchanged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar#:~:text=For%20orchestrating%20the,.%5B4%5D)

If the number of hostages to prisoners was reduced to 5 to 1 with UN overseen post war elections, there would be some possibility of acceptance. 

I’m guessing that Hamas staying in power isn’t considered a good thing by anyone. Netanyahu needs to go too but at least there are mechanisms to remove him from power and his polls are through the floor, it is not expected that he will survive a post war election.

But I saw this video and I thought it was really worth watching and sharing.

The understanding of Zionism as oppressive settler colonialism is important and perspectives like those presented here by Shlomo Yitzchak emphasise how the dehumanisation and distancing is an integral element of oppression. The narratives themselves can be deeply damaging and dangerous. The abstractions, euphemisms, and distancing is itself a problem. 

The humanity of this story really resonated with me and I thought it deserved some signal boosting and attention:

https://twitter.com/ME_Observer_/status/1731160875308888191

I think one important message in this is that not communicating is itself dangerous. Closing off the discussion and failing to examine our biases is a cause and driving force behind extremism and can feed into real violence even though it might be a cumulative effect hidden behind a wall.

You'd also see that the issue here isn't about messing around with firearms at a fair, it's about all the myriad ways the state induces a fear and hatred of the other in Israeli society, first by instilling a siege mentality in the minds of young people growing up in a settler colonial state and culminating in the use of conscription as an ideological, rather than defensive, tool. 

Also... I guess there wasn't much time left between shooting guns at summer camp to teach you about the Trail of Tears and what happened to your state's indiginous seminole population because otherwise I'm sure you wouldn't cite Florida, the US, and GB as examples *against* genocide?

You are characterising EDL 

""The English Defence League (EDL) is a far-right, Islamophobic organisation in England. A social movement and pressure group that employs street demonstrations as its main tactic, the EDL presents itself as a single-issue movement opposed to Islamism and Islamic extremism, although its rhetoric and actions target Islam and Muslims more widely. Founded in 2009, its heyday lasted until 2011, after which it entered a decline. ""

&nbsp;

>hese incursions and attacks are directly linked to the larger context of the
Israeli occupation and the blockade of Gaza. Israel’s occupation policies, described
in depth in the Commission’s previous report to the General Assembly, such as
systematic discrimination, coercive environment, settlement expansion and impunity
for settler violence, evictions and displacement of Palestinians from their homes, as
well as the 16-year blockade of Gaza, have all served as a backdrop and catalyst for
attacks on Gaza.105 The blockade, which constitutes a collective punishment of the
residents in Gaza, has significantly weakened the capacity of the population and
public sector to respond to the devastation caused by repeated attacks. More than
600,000 people have been internally displaced as a result. 106 The impact of
displacement, death and injuries of family members has been particularly dire for
women, as it has been compounded by gendered dimensions of the economic hardship
and by increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence. Displacement has also
caused children to lose access to education, health care and other essential services.

>Another common talking point that is easily debunked. If all ""Palestinians"" could vote in Israel, they'd just vote for Israel to not be Jewish, and probably just vote in Hamas as Israel's government. 

Ethnostates don't justify apartheid. Israel has no right to occupy, conduct apartheid, or ethnic cleansing. They have obligations under international law, which they ignore. That does not make their position acceptable.

Furthermore, support for a two-state solution was much higher. The Oslo accords were undermined by Netanyahu and that derailed the peace process. It shattered the faith in the two-state solution. He's on video claiming that and explaining how he did it.

Israel has no legal right to declare war on a region that it is illegally occupying, besieging, and in which it is conducting an apartheid. That is not defence, repulsing the attack was defence. This is just violence, murder, and war crimes. 

And don't take my word for it, ask the [UN's special rapporteur on the occupied territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesca_Albanese#Career) - it's her judgement I'm citing because she's actually an expert on the situation and international law:

>What was your issue with the 2000 peace talks? What is the unworkable part you think couldn't have been negotiated and compromised on? 

They never actually proposed a workable solution to the Palestinians.

To put it simply:

>**the measure of Israel's concessions ought not be how far it has moved from its own starting point; it must be how far it has moved toward a fair solution.**

&nbsp;


>To accommodate the settlers, Israel was to annex 9 percent of the West Bank; in exchange, the new Palestinian state would be granted sovereignty over parts of Israel proper, equivalent to one-ninth of the annexed land. A Palestinian state covering 91 percent of the West Bank and Gaza was more than most Americans or Israelis had thought possible, but how would Mr. Arafat explain the unfavorable 9-to-1 ratio in land swaps to his people?

>In Jerusalem, Palestine would have been given sovereignty over many Arab neighborhoods of the eastern half and over the Muslim and Christian quarters of the Old City. While it would enjoy custody over the Haram al Sharif, the location of the third-holiest Muslim shrine, Israel would exercise overall sovereignty over this area, known to Jews as the Temple Mount. This, too, was far more than had been thinkable only a few weeks earlier, and a very difficult proposition for the Israeli people to accept. But how could Mr. Arafat have justified to his people that Israel would retain sovereignty over some Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, let alone over the Haram al Sharif? As for the future of refugees -- for many Palestinians, the heart of the matter -- the ideas put forward at Camp David spoke vaguely of a ''satisfactory solution,'' leading Mr. Arafat to fear that he would be asked to swallow an unacceptable last-minute proposal.

&nbsp;


>Many have come to believe that the Palestinians' rejection of the Camp David ideas exposed an underlying rejection of Israel's right to exist. But consider the facts: The Palestinians were arguing for the creation of a Palestinian state based on the June 4, 1967, borders, living alongside Israel. They accepted the notion of Israeli annexation of West Bank territory to accommodate settlement blocs. They accepted the principle of Israeli sovereignty over the Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem -- neighborhoods that were not part of Israel before the Six Day War in 1967. And, while they insisted on recognition of the refugees' right of return, they agreed that it should be implemented in a manner that protected Israel's demographic and security interests by limiting the number of returnees.

Not to mention the issues with the Clinton parameters:

>On 2 January 2001, at a meeting in the White House, Arafat gave his qualified agreement to the Parameters with reservations. In a memorandum, his Negotiations Support Unit (NSU) had warned him ""that the proposals in general are too vague and unclear to form an acceptable framework for an agreement"".[26] The negotiation team opposed the use of percentages. First, the Israelis were to make clear which reasonable needs they had in specific areas; without a map, the percentages given were also ambiguous, as the Israelis did not include all disputed land or part of the Dead Sea, and it was unclear where the 80% proportion of settlers would remain. All Israeli settlers taken together occupied around 1.8% of the West Bank. The Palestinian concerns about lack of contiguity were largely related to Israeli control over large swaths of land in key development areas such as Jerusalem and Bethlehem, due to the large settlement blocs. Palestinians would be unable to move without restriction within their own state

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clinton_Parameters

They weren't real workable proposals because they only really offered a workable state to one party whilst severely undermining the other. I'd argue that they were unworkable from the beginning and a lack of willingness to compromise to a realistic set of proposals led to them being rejected.",2023-11-10T10:41:30+00:00

Neither side has a legal right to commit war crimes or crimes against humanity.

I asked you what your issue was with the 2000 peace talks and you seem to of copied and pasted chunks of text from a New York Times article from 2001. Your argument would be better served by articulating your opinions rather than selectively copying parts of Robert Malley's analysis.

On the article...

Just before the text you have copied it says:

>Yes, what was put on the table was more far-reaching than anything any Israeli leader had discussed in the past -- whether with the Palestinians or with Washington. But it was not the dream offer it has been made out to be, at least not from a Palestinian perspective.

It also says (right above another bit your quoted):

>The facts do not indicate, however, any lack of foresight or vision on the part of Ehud Barak. He had uncommon political courage as well. But the measure of Israel's concessions ought not be how far it has moved from its own starting point; it must be how far it has moved toward a fair solution.

This goes against your position that Israel was operating in bad faith in those talks.

It's a good and interesting article but it doesn't back up your claims that Israel operated at these talks in bad faith and that there weren't any real workable options. Malley himself says he was frustrated by the Palestinians ""passivity and inability to seize the moment"".

&#x200B;

Edit: It also goes against your original claim that ""Netanyahu shattered the faith in a two state solution in the 90s"" when there was clearly a very real push for it in the 2000s.

LabourUK,comment,Annexation,kfl4geu,Old_Roof,,"I know intervention in any way is always controversial on the left, and rightly so. There have been so many clusterfucks post war & they far outweigh any positive interventions.

Yet sometimes the choice is obvious. This is one of them. Deterrence is always better than inviting conflict. What is always ignored during the Falklands conflict is how reckless Thatchers government was in the years before the invasion, practically leaving the islands abandoned. If we’d taken defence of the Falklands seriously it would have never happened & all those poor British & Argentine lives could have been saved.

So yes we should support Guyana in the same way we are supporting Ukraine. Send them defensive weapons, train their troops where necessary, offer them intelligence- and protect their sovereignty. Get an international coalition to support Guyana including most importantly Lula. Hopefully that will be enough to deter the Venezuelan dictatorship of doing anything stupid.

There is no existential threat against israel, 20 years ago they said the same thing about Arab countries, and now half of them have diplomatic relations with israel.

I don't understand what is a ceasefire while Gazan is under an actual military action (blockade). It's not like life was normal for Gazans that a ceasefire actually is meaningful. You keep your boot on their necks and when they push back you say here look, hamas broke the ceasefire.

But either way, from all the ceasefire infractions, isrsel broke it up the most, the only difference was, that israel was the only side whom could wage a war in response to a ceasefire breach. For instance earlier in May, after a new ceasefire, israel assassinated a few Islamic jihad members along with 7 civilians. It broke that ceasefire. Aannnnyway.

Up until October 7th, ceasefire or no ceasefire, in the westbank, where hamas doesn't shoot rockets, hamas doesn't administer, israel killed more than 150 Palestinians, built settlements.

Here’s a [WHO infographic](https://www.emro.who.int/images/stories/palestine/documents/15_years_of_blockade_and_health_in-gaza.pdf?ua=1) from last year with some info.

There is no existential threat against israel, 20 years ago they said the same thing about Arab countries, and now half of them have diplomatic relations with israel.

I don't understand what is a ceasefire while Gazan is under an actual military action (blockade). It's not like life was normal for Gazans that a ceasefire actually is meaningful. You keep your boot on their necks and when they push back you say here look, hamas broke the ceasefire.

But either way, from all the ceasefire infractions, isrsel broke it up the most, the only difference was, that israel was the only side whom could wage a war in response to a ceasefire breach. For instance earlier in May, after a new ceasefire, israel assassinated a few Islamic jihad members along with 7 civilians. It broke that ceasefire. Aannnnyway.

Up until October 7th, ceasefire or no ceasefire, in the westbank, where hamas doesn't shoot rockets, hamas doesn't administer, israel killed more than 150 Palestinians, built settlements.

I think the ruling was clear that Israel isn't following international law in many cases - eg, members of the Likud Government's public communications.

In particular, it's point 2 that will matter in the short term - the ruling made clear that access to Gaza for humanitarian aid must be significantly improved and the that Likud Government & IDF representatives should cease incitement of genocide.

LabourUK,comment,Israel Defense Forces,k9hxreb,MissingBothCufflinks,,"> A state cannot simultaneously exercise control over territory it occupies and militarily attack that territory on the claim that it is “foreign” and poses an exogenous national security threat.

The entire article is predicated on this erroneous legal claim.

Firstly, in peace time at least, Hamas exercises much more control than Israel does over the Gaza strip.  Controlling a state's borders and cross-border traffic is not the same as controlling a state, much less makes it part of your own state.

Secondly, the public international law right to self-defence isn't limited to state actors.  It is a law applicable in any cross-border scenario, specifically qualifying the general prohibition on using force against other persons who are not part of the first state.  

Thirdly, even then, the articles claim boils down to a trite truism; Israel doesnt need to rely on the -international- law of self-defence if (which I do not accept) gaza is within Israel's nation, because then national law applies and Israel can essentially authorise what it likes.  The concept of the international law of self defence is about when use of force is allowed by one state in the territory of another state.  If the argument is that Gaza/Palestine isnt its own state therefore they cant use this defence, that's fine, but they also dont need to, as the general prohibition doesnt apply either.

Basically from a jurisprudence angle this entire article is a mess.

There are much better arguments to be made on grounds of proportionality, collective punishment, no legitimate military objectives, Human Rights, etc.   Israel is not acting lawfully, but not because of some spurious (And irrelevant) nonsense about the inapplicability of self-defence exceptions in controlled territories.",2023-11-16T13:27:55+00:00

It is a moment to reflect, and that also includes the atrocities of all wars, especially World War I and II, the loss of life, including the terrible atrocities enacted in the Holocaust against Jews. It’s to say “never again”, “lest we forget”, and remember those that lost their lives as well as those that sacrificed their lives so the rest of us can be free.

But the biggest part is not forgetting the past, and saying never again.

Yes, hatred of Jews is completely wrong, abhorrent and unacceptable at any time. The Holocaust enacted upon Jews in World War II is one of the absolutely worst tragedies in human history. It should be remembered.

We know that this would not be the situation if the occupation and apartheid weren't also a part of the situation.

At the end of the day, there can be no real discussion about the future of Gaza without it also including the future of peace in the Levant. Singling out Hamas as a shit organisation, which I fully agree it is, is placing the blame for why this situation has come to exist entirely on the wrong side of the wall. What can Palestinians living in Gaza do about Hamas? What can they do to survive the onslaught from Israel? What can they do to bring about a lasting peace when they're trapped in essentially an open air prison and desperately searching for something that can end this situation and give them back lives and futures?

I don't agree with Hamas in the slightest but I recognise the context is a vital component to understanding the future. And I also recognise that a movement like Hamas will gain support from this bombing campaign and from the apartheid itself.

And also it is ridiculous to talk to me about schools as indoctrination centres and militarisation without also mentioning how that is unquestionably rampant within Israel too. I know about the anti-miscegenation groups for Israeli kids. I've seen examples of the militarism in schools. I know about the mandatory conscription.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah%E2%80%93Hamas_conflict

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gaza_(2007)

That's just not true and yes, I am aware of the memorandum of understanding and, no, that doesn't invalidate my point. 

Palestinians are oppressed and subject to apartheid, there are reasons the secular movement try to limit the infighting and promote internal peace that go well-beyond chalking it up to acceptance of the views of groups like Hamas. 

So I can and do condemn specific acts of violence, war crimes, and their harming innocents. I can and do condemn specific groups that have horrible ideologies. 

But I won't pretend it is Hamas that has created this situation or that Israel's actions are really a response. October 7^th was a horrible, tragic, and awful event but it was not an isolated one. It was not just a random attack and those pretending that this current situation was primarily caused by Hamas rather than by decades of wrong-doing by Israel are lying about the reality of the situation.

Israel could have made serious progress on peace within the West Bank prior to this situation - they could have done that rather than expanding the settlement program. They could have engaged in unilateral actions to show sincerity and offered a real route to a two state solution. Showing that the secular path was fruitful would have killed off support for Hamas but instead we got this and no doubt the trauma of today will feed the bloodshed and pretexts of tomorrow too.",2023-12-10T17:54:49+00:00

Mate, Hamas are not the ANC. The rhetoric being the same does not mean its of equal validity in both situations. Hamas is far more violent and brutal than the ANC ever was and  we have viable alternatives to Hamas to conduct the struggle.

Hamas are not the legitimate administrators of the Gaza Strip and their conduct is not acceptable. The people of Gaza are amongst their victims.

You can engage in all the revisionism you like, anti-colonialism has a history *steeped* in violence precisely because it's basically inevitable due to how colonial powers like the State of Israel behave.

As for what the attacks did for the future of Palestine your argument would have had a bit of bite to it 30 years ago around the time of the first Oslo accords.

Now?

Yes, both the ANC and Hamas are terrorist groups. That does not mean they're comparable and you saying they are is utterly ridiculous.

You accuse me of revisionism when You are the one who is completely misrepresenting Hamas. Hamas are absolutely NOT violent for the same reasons as the ANC and their goals are not overall laudable in the same way the ANCs were.

Hamas do not seek simply to end the occupation and live in peace. They seek to commit a genocide against the Israeli population and ethnically cleanse the country to establish their own ethnostate. Just like the problematic politicians in Israel want to do to the Palestinians.

They took control of the Gaza Strip using force against other Palestinians, They've executed innocent Palestinians and destroyed other Palestinian groups that are not as radical as they are. They exhibit a level of violence and brutality beyond anything the ANC ever did. The ANC killed a dozen People or so a year over a decade and conducted hundreds operations that never killed anyone. Hamas massacred and raped civilians en masses and openly state they wish to commit genocide.

You and others keep desperately trying to compare Hamas to the ANC despite the two situations being completely different.

Labour,post,Israel,17y31u4,Yakel1,Israel doesn't have the legal right to self-defense,"The right of self-defense can be invoked when a state is threatened by another state, which is not the case here. Israel has not claimed that another state has threatened it. Article 51 of the UN Charter that Israel has invoked is a legal term. Self defence under international law means the right to wage a war which Israel doesn't have.

Israel has been threatened by an armed group — qualify how you want. It is an armed group within an occupied territory. Like it or not, Gaza is not a standalone entity. Despite Israel's withdrawal of settlements and bases in 2005, the Gaza Strip remains occupied legally.

Israel cannot claim the right of self-defense against a threat that emanates from the territory it occupies, from a territory that is kept under belligerent occupation. This applies to the West Bank as well as Gaza. The occupation makes Israel the aggressor. Gazans, like all Palestinians, are an occupied people and have the legal right to resist, including by armed force (though not to target civilians). Israel, as the occupying power, has an obligation to withdraw – not a right to defend territories it controls or is colonizing by dint of military power.

Sure, Israel will disagree and muddle the waters, but to paraphrase the immortal words of Mandy Rice-Davies, ""They would say that, wouldn't they.""",2023-11-18T09:44:06+00:00

It would legitimise their (Palestine) government, legitimise their relationships, create strong pressure to remove blockades, create strong pressure to allow them to control their own borders. They would also be able to control their own media, their own trade, their own infrastructure. It would also entirely alter any conflict. Any act of aggression from either side would be a legitimate act of war, that would be subject to scrutiny.“

Would you feel more comfortable in the accuracy of my statement if I change it to saying you’ve claimed recognition of statehood will magically *nearly* resolve the Israel/Palestinian conflict? You’ve after all stated that it will though some unknown mysterious mechanism let the Palestinians control their own trade, infrastructure and media as well as putting strong pressure on all the other key areas. Presumably Israeli bullets will bounce off any ships coming to deliver cargo and the bombs that Israel will drop on a seaport if Gaza tries to construct it will magically turn out to be duds.

If you don’t like that I’m presuming these things will happen by magic, then actually give your own reason for how they come about because at the moment magic is all you are giving me.

You also say I’ve out forward no points but I’ve obviously put forward multiple points, from how Palestinians have has recognised internal legal rights despite being a territory to the international recognition of the 1967 green line borders to the difference in strategy in recognising a country’s statehood in I/P compared to the South African Bantustans.

No one is supporting Hamas in the UK as much as they are condemning Israel and demanding our politicians do the same.

The boycott bill was reintroduced into Parliament the other day, at a time when we see, more than ever, the importance of peaceful forms of protest.

As Peter Beinart wrote this week, diaspora “Jews who rightly hate Hamas but know, in their bones, that Israel’s treatment of Palestinians is profoundly wrong must ask themselves a painful question: What nonviolent forms of Palestinian resistance to oppression will I support?” 

We call on fellow Jews in the UK to oppose this curtailment of our civil liberties in the name of protecting us. This draconian legislation doesn't make us any safer and curbs one of the key ways of showing solidarity with Palestinians.

Since then it gave the Sinai desert back to Egypt for peace, and offered to give the West Bank to Jordan for peace, but Jordan didn't want the West Bank and they preferred to sign peace without getting it (I wonder why), Israel has also offered a ton of peace offers to the Palestinians, of which they refused each one

Non citizens don't get the same rights as citizens, this is the same in every country in the world, and is the same for each military occupation that didn't result in annexation in history

The Palestinians don't want to be annexed, nor do they want to sign peace that they will allow them to set up their own country

Next argument.

Would saying that the French don't deserve self determination and should be left the mercy of others not be racist?

Labour,post,Israel-Palestine Conflict/Conflict,tzwyab,zammyrasta,Why is the movement so conflicted over this?,"I feel like this is going to be inflammatory but here goes-

There's a conflict in the Labour movement right now over Israel and Palestine, and I'm curious to get some thoughts on it. Israel commits war crimes on Palestinian soil, and yet many people on the left are jumping to the support of Israel. They're using provocations which are (from another viewpoint) purely defensive to justify any number of atrocities and rigorously opposing boycotts, divestment and sanctions on the aggressor state. People point to Hamas, as though all Palestinians are responsible for the beliefs and actions of a very small contingent, and using that small contingent to throw the legitimacy of a Palestinian state into question.

I strongly support the Palestinian cause, and understand the frustrations with prominent figures in the movement who seem to avoid condemning the actions of the Israeli government (and would hope that it was understood that in criticising the Israeli government is not in any way intended as to impugn innocent Israelis).

Now this is where it gets spicy, because if you swap Russia for Israel, Ukraine for Palestine, Azov for Hamas, and the current regime of sanctions for BDS, a lot of people's viewpoints pull a 180 degree about-face (or at least, it seems that way to me.)

Labour,comment,Gaza Genocide/Genocide,kjnunfm,Akton,,"To everyone saying this is meaningless because it doesn’t order a ceasefire, I agree that would have been best but all the legal analysts I read were saying that it is very unlikely for them to order that since they are sensitive to the fact that they can’t also order Hamas to stop fighting and they don’t want to give a one sided order. This is about the best we could realistically hope for at this juncture (let’s be real it was always going to be largely symbolic). To the extent this is meaningful it’s that it can be used to build a further legal case that could eventually see individuals prosecuted post hoc.

E: also they were unlikely to order a ceasefire in the provisional measures because that would necessarily involve some sort of definitive ruling on whether Gaza was considered occupied and whether Israel had a right to self defense there, which it would be seen as inappropriate to settle in a provisional ruling.",2024-01-26T14:41:49+00:00

The exact wording, from Section 78 of the ICJ ruling is:

>The Court considers that, with regard to the situation described above, Israel must, in 
accordance with its obligations under the Genocide Convention, in relation to Palestinians in Gaza, 
take all measures within its power to prevent the commission of all acts within the scope of Article 
II of this Convention, in particular: (a) killing members of the group; (b) causing serious bodily or 
mental harm to members of the group; (c) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life 
calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; and (d) imposing measures 
intended to prevent births within the group. The Court recalls that these acts fall within the scope of 
Article II of the Convention when they are committed with the intent to destroy in whole or in part a 
group as such (see paragraph 44 above). The Court further considers that Israel must ensure with 
immediate effect that its military forces do not commit any of the above-described acts.",2024-01-26T19:45:53+00:00

Israel celebrates literal war crimes, like going into hospitals and shooting Hamas fighters receiving medical treatment, as well as executing the medics, and no one bats an eyelid.

I've noticed that everyone is framing the Iran attack as unprovoked and that ""Israel will/must counterattack"". It's bizarre watching Big Brother's Ministry of Truth happen in real time. Did I imagine the [missile attack in Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_bombing_of_the_Iranian_embassy_in_Damascus)? The one which no one from the West wants to condemn. Even Yvette Cooper fully backs bombing embassies (used to be an official declaration of war). 

I don't and would not advocate the bombing of an embassy in a third country because I'm not a moron or a terrorist like [Osama Bin Laden who bombed US embassies across Africa](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/u-s-embassies-in-east-africa-bombed). But apparently, ambassadors are valid targets according to this Labour front bench.

https://theconversation.com/are-embassies-off-limits-ecuadorian-and-israeli-actions-suggest-otherwise-and-that-sets-a-dangerous-diplomatic-precedent-227398

>Of the two recent incidents, the Iranian embassy bombing is the more serious, as it involved the loss of life and resulted in warnings of retaliatory attacks.

>Yet, Western countries, leaders of which often voice concern over upholding the so-called “rules-based order,” have been reluctant to condemn the act.

>It was notable that the three liberal democracies on the U.N. Security Council – the United States, the United Kingdom and France – all refused to condemn the strike on Iran’s embassy when the issue came up before them.

>Israel, while not officially acknowledging responsibility, argued that the Iranian ambassador’s residence was not really a diplomatic venue but “a military building … disguised as a civilian building.” As such, to Israel it was a perfectly legitimate target.

>But by this logic, nearly all embassies would be seen as fair game.

>Almost by definition, the vast majority of embassies – particularly of the larger countries – are populated with significant numbers of military and intelligence personnel. To suggest that for that reason embassies should lose their diplomatic immunity and become legitimate targets for armed attacks would bring the whole edifice of the Vienna Convention crashing down. And with it would come the structure on which worldwide formal diplomatic interactions are based.",2024-04-17T19:09:37+00:00

It is getting stranger and stranger.

EDIT: A few clarifications are in order.

My primary criticism of Starmer is his utter disregard for freedom of speech in the party. This manifests itself across the board but is most prominent in the context of the discourse on Israel, where many of our best activists, include close friends of mine, have been ousted. This is why I call him out on this and why I said what I did.

You may disagree with this position and claim that it is tactically or strategically wrong or self defeating. You could be right.

The point of this post is that calling someone who defines himself as Zionist as having a Zionist agenda that is destroying the party- which is probably true - is a legitimate position and not hate speech. It is only those who seek to stifle debate on Palestine who would state this.

You may disagree. That does not make it hate speech.",2021-11-06T16:22:52+00:00

Labour,comment,Palestine Refugees,hjkvpam,Uglyboy2000,,"I don't support Zionism, and UkPol and LabUK are shitholes who ban people for anything. 

But we need to be careful with our language. 

Starmer - whether he believes in Zionism or not - is not pushing a ""Zionist agenda"". His agenda is to reverse the work of Jeremy Corbyn and ensure that the Labour Party is a safe party for ultra-wealthy corporate figures, and stands as a vanguard *against* any kind of socialism  or meaningful change. It is an agenda the Labour Right have *always* stood for. 

Saying that Starmer has a ""Zionist agenda"" or that Labour is ""under the control of Zionists"" (not saying you have said this, but others who may not understand the implications have) is completely unhelpful. It leans into old antisemitic implications of Jews controlling the politics of countries and influencing things with ""Jewish money"". 

Labour is not under the control of Zionists. It is under the control of people who think Thatcherism was a good thing and that the Labour Party's purpose should be to continue Maggie's noble work. No doubt they worked *with* Zionists to oppose Jeremy Corbyn and the Left, but only because they had mutual interests (The Labour Right in purifying the party and eliminating any anti-capitalist policies, Zionists to eliminate a mainstream party leader being pro-Palestine), but the Labour Right has always been its own faction with its own agenda, and by blaming Zionists for all of it,  you're helping that agenda by giving the Labour Right ammunition to call us antisemitic, which presume you are not.",2021-11-06T18:26:27+00:00

That said, using the word Zionist in the way you did is something I would consider pretty offensive - I wouldn't want to ban you for it but I would push back. 

Context is key, if your comment came in a discussion of Zionism, fair enough, otherwise calling someone a Zionist out of the blue looks sus. I'm Jewish (not a political Zionist) if we're discussing something related and you say ''what do you think as a jew?'' fine, if we're discussing something unrelated and you say ''you would say that you jew'' that would be completely unacceptable. 

>He's so busy pushing his Zionist agenda he's destroying Labour.

The 'Zionist agenda' in question being pursuing claims of antisemitism, right? Because Zionism refers to [a broad range of cultural and political beliefs](https://www.heyalma.com/israel-guide/what-is-zionism/) which have in common support for the continued existence of an Israeli state - and nothing else. Implying that chasing antisemitism claims is part of a 'Zionist agenda' is conflating antisemitism and antizionism.

While I agree that the disproportionate focus on antisemitism is blatant you have put yourself on a tricky intellectual footing - if countering antisemitism is Zionist then supporting antisemitism looks antizionist.",2021-11-06T18:15:41+00:00

Whilst I don't believe this was your intent, this commentary kinda centers Zionism as the key issue with Starmer. 

It isn't. The Israeli state/military are part of a cabal that protects Western interests. In exchange for this, Western governments tend to put their weight behind Israel's genocidal policies. 

Saying that Starmer is behaving the way he does because he's a ""Zionist"" is wrong. He is a small part of a much wider apparatus of repression-for-profit, of which the Israeli govt is a small part. To say he's doing so because he's a Zionist implies Zionism is in control over said apparatus, which is sort of anti-Semitic.

I'd argue doing so also erases the much darker truth that the biggest reason this apparatus exists is for the benefit of corporate power, be it oil companies or weapons companies to name but a few. There are mutual benefits in the security alliance between Israeli gov/western govs/corporate interests in the middle East.

Labour,post,Israel Defense Forces,17y31u4,Yakel1,Israel doesn't have the legal right to self-defense,"The right of self-defense can be invoked when a state is threatened by another state, which is not the case here. Israel has not claimed that another state has threatened it. Article 51 of the UN Charter that Israel has invoked is a legal term. Self defence under international law means the right to wage a war which Israel doesn't have.

Israel has been threatened by an armed group — qualify how you want. It is an armed group within an occupied territory. Like it or not, Gaza is not a standalone entity. Despite Israel's withdrawal of settlements and bases in 2005, the Gaza Strip remains occupied legally.

Israel cannot claim the right of self-defense against a threat that emanates from the territory it occupies, from a territory that is kept under belligerent occupation. This applies to the West Bank as well as Gaza. The occupation makes Israel the aggressor. Gazans, like all Palestinians, are an occupied people and have the legal right to resist, including by armed force (though not to target civilians). Israel, as the occupying power, has an obligation to withdraw – not a right to defend territories it controls or is colonizing by dint of military power.

Sure, Israel will disagree and muddle the waters, but to paraphrase the immortal words of Mandy Rice-Davies, ""They would say that, wouldn't they.""",2023-11-18T09:44:06+00:00

Labour,comment,PLO,e44t5e3,kavabean2,,"Bsesio was the Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO) liaison officer with foreign intelligence agencies. He was assassinated in Paris in 1992.

He was a member of Black September, the organization from which the Olympic attackers were recruited

He was on Mossad's list of assassination targets until 1988, when he was taken off the list.

He was then secretly put back on the list by Shabtai Shavit, the director of Missed

Prior to his assassination he was working with the CIA to share intelligence information with Western countries on terrorist operations hostile to Western interests

After his assassination the CIA agent Robert Baer, one of those officials he was to meet the following day, stated that one primary reason for Mossad's killing of Bseiso was to block the growing international recognition of the PLO arising in part from the organization's links with key Western intelligence agencies. 

The French were also furious that Mossad had performed a targeted assassination on French soil, and began to crack down on Mossad infrastructure and operations in that country. 

The assassination was also at a time when Israel and the PLO were close to a rapprochement, and we're secretly negotiating the Oslo accords.

Zionism fundamentally is the idea that the Jewish people have the right to their own state as a reaction to ever growing antisemitism in both Europe and the middle east. The state of Israel has tainted this idea with their vile acts and hypocrisy, but this does not make Zionism fundamentally “ethno-supremacist”.

I totally agree with you on the latter point about the oppression of the Palestinian people. What they go through on a daily basis is vile and Israel should be held accountable for their monstrous actions.

The issue of the validity of Zionism will always be a tricky one, but I’d argue from what you said above that we should also look at the history of the Jewish people in that area.

In its essence, it is a central-European, 19th century nationalist ideology — with all that entails in terms of the atrocities these ideologies perpetrated in Europe in the 20th century. This is probably one of the reasons it takes so easily to the dehumanization and brutalization of any others it finds itself in conflict with.

It is with this in mind that the current approach the Zionists have to the Palestinians and other non-Jews makes sense. Anyone who has ever spoken to any of the militant Zionists — whether religious, settler-types or militaristic secular IDF-types will be astonished at the crass brutality that underlies their sentiments. They have no qualms about the atrocities that Zionism has carried out over the last century up to and including the mass-murder and genocide in-all-but-name in Gaza.

Labour,comment,PLO,fygruyc,daudder,,"> Zionism fundamentally is the idea that the Jewish people have the right to their own state as a reaction to ever growing antisemitism in both Europe and the middle east. The state of Israel has tainted this idea with their vile acts and hypocrisy, but this does not make Zionism fundamentally “ethno-supremacist”.

Zionism, as you define it, is unquestionably ethno-supremacist by definition since this ""own state"" — wherever you put it and whoever you are forced to exclude to achieve it will belong to Jews from any place in the world in preference to the indigenous people. Thus, the ethno-supremacist nature of Israel is not some vile avoidable aberration but built in to the concept of an ethno-state — which is the only genuine and fair definition of a country that fulfils the requirement of being the Jews' ""own state"".

This is precisely the reason that all the Zionists I have heard relate to the concept of a ""state of its citizens"" reject this concept since it ""means the destruction of the State of Israel"", since a ""state of its citizens"" and a ""state owned by the Jews"", when there is more than one ethnicity present, are contradictory.

Thus, the State of Israel did not ""taint"" this idea, but implemented it in the only way possible — by excluding the non-Jews using any means necessary. Sure, the Israelis could have been nicer about it, and could still be, but there was never a way to co-opt the Palestinians into the Zionist project since the vast majority of them were not Jews and so the Israeli state could never be their own.

The idea that Jews have a calling to a homeland that involves working cooperatively and peacefully with the various cultures (including Arabic Jews) already living there is obviously an idea that feels fine.

However, this isn't the reality. You are treated differently under the law as a non-Jew in Israel - it is a defacto apartheid state at the moment. It's the world's longest ongoing occupation and it's an active form of settler colonialism.

Zionism as an *idea* doesn't have to be ethno-supremacist (although a realist might say the position is inevitable when considering the religious dogma and geopolitics involved), but it's no longer just an idea. We can see the results for ourselves.

This is probably one of the reasons it takes so easily to the dehumanization and brutalization of any others it finds itself in conflict with.

It is with this in mind that the current approach the Zionists have to the Palestinians and other non-Jews makes sense.

The systemic injustice that is glorified by the IOF. Because again there’s no Hamas in west bank so why is the IOF committing war crimes in the west bank? Why were they doing this before Oct7th ?

At least i can see the evil on both sides and dont have a flawed understanding of the history in the region like you appear to. Why are you going on about west bank instead of acknowledging the elephant in the room of how hamas as an organisation has led palestinians in to destruction by calling for the extermination of jews from israel. They preach hatred and so hatred is what falls on them. You are blind if you dont see the fault that lays at their feet.

Oct 7th wasnt some justified freedom fighting attack. Freedom fighters dont rape and kill families. There are videos of the corpses hamas left in the houses, and it is disgusting and abhorrent in the extreme. The only reason you havent seen that evidence is because you choose not to see it.

Stop wasting your breath, because I have already said how i view the israeli leaderships methods of conducting the war on hamas, and that i abhor the cycle of violence, preaching of hatred, and inability to compromise or share power that has led to the current situation. I just dont have as much of a one sided and conveniently reductive way of viewing the conflict in the region as you seem to. Surprisingly when two factions each call for the others extermination and see the other side gaining power as a threat, very ugly conflict occurs. It is the nature of human conflict and has happened throughout history over and over again.

Because again Hamas isn't in the West Bank and the IOF has been occupying West Bank before Oct 7th so this statement follows no logic.

When did I say it was? Another strawman

Except you do. You're blaming a small militant group for the onslaught of civilians that is being carried out by an illegal occupying force. Hamas is clearly a bigger concern to you than the country that has the resources to spare civilian casualties and kill them but actively refuses to. 

If the IOF was launching units to specific places where Hamas militants were operating and killing them and not harming civilians I would have significantly less of an issue than what they're doing now which is killing aid workers, reporters, civilians sometimes even Israeli hostages. You are looking at all of these things and screaming 'Hamas' but again what about Westbank this region that doesn't have Hamas at all why is the IOF there?",2024-04-12T06:29:10+00:00

Hamas governed the gaza strip, hides amongst civilians and cynically uses them as shields, even operating from hospitals (which is a war crime) and using tunnels underneath homes and schools, using ambulances for moving troops and weapons, and other strategies designed to shield their military infrastructure using civilian structures. 

There was inevitably going to be civilian casualties when hamas is so embedded within the population in this way.

SNP,comment,Israel,hbfwlir,AnnoKano,,"So the Green Party are ""solar powered, honest to Gaia crazies"" because they are... critical of Israel?

I thought you had to be a decent writer to work at the Spectator...

I could forgive the predictable mudslinging about them being environmentalists, but in an article that is otherwise entirely about Israel it's a complete non sequitur. Was the author so proud of that line that it simply had to stay?

The article doesn't even do a good job of explaining why these views are so ""crazy"" in the first place. The author is taking it for granted that people who read the Spectator are already firmly pro-Israel, because anyone who is either on the fence or who disagrees with him on the subject will be left with more questions than answers by the end of it.

Take the statement that the Green Party believes that Israel is an apartheid state for example.  Apparently this view is so absurd, so ludicrous, so self-evidently incorrect that it does not require any further explanation or counter-argument. But repeating it alone is sufficient to debunk it; anyone who is even remotely familiar with the Israel-Palestine conflict knows this is a reference to the West Bank and a major point of contention in the conflict. At the same time, any undecided but intellectually curious person will recognise the severity of such an accusation and will investigate it further... and once they find out that Palestinians are living separately from Israelis... well, that sounds like an Apartheid to me. 

This approach is made even worse by the fact 
some of the points this way are simply statements of objective fact. It is not only the Green Party that considers Israel a Jewish state for example... that is also how Israel defines itself. The scare quotes help of course, but I believe the triple brackets are more in vogue nowadays.

There is of course a reason he doesn't take the opposing view seriously; examining it properly would do more to undermine his own position, than to persuade the reader that the Greens views truly are crazy.

It really looks like a lot of though has gone into this so if it's your own work then credit to you for trying to resolve what we can all agree is a serious problem. (though I would argue semantics are important 😂)  


I'm a big supporter of devolution whether at a national or regional/council level. It's one of the things I believe the scottish government could do more with, we should be giving more powers to councils as it's the people who choose to live and work in an area who know best what it needs.   


I think your concept is interesting but for me it still leaves too much power out of the hands of the scottish government for me to be comfortable with it. We already have some tax raising powers but for instance we have very limited borrowing powers and no control over VAT (which at time like this seems mad), further more the Scottish Government is missing too many of the fiscal levers that most countries have.   


20 or 30 years ago I think this would be a great concept and I'm sure it would have worked however I do feel that at this point in the road we are too far gone for it to ever realistically happen. The UK government has proven that it doesn't care enough about the North of England let alone the other three countries. Furthermore the only party who might ever support such a concept would the labour party and they are unlikely to follow such a policy under Starmer (Corbyn perhaps) all of which is irrelevant because even with the current state of the Tory party a Labour win is just so unrealistic at this point.

And the relevant point is found in the evidence from Wyn Jones (a Welsh academic who studies this topic), and copy pasting the notes I took on what he said:

- Very little support in England for policy differentiation (underpins lack of support for regionalism), and only London stands out, rest of England very consistent in their views

- General majority English view, to have ""England recognised not just as a residual category—that is, the thing left over after the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish have done their thing—but some more positive recognition of England is what people want""

- ""the political class has been very slow to recognise the politicisation of English national identity and the decreasing sense of the legitimacy that the institutions of the UK enjoy among the English in particular""

- Only 1 in 5 English approve of the status quo in terms of way England governed, ""accompanied increasing awareness in England that public services were being delivered differently in Scotland and Wales""

And Manchester I think is, with London, an exception rather than the rule. There was another select committee report about English devolution (House of Commons Communities and Local Government Committee Devolution: the next five years and beyond First Report of Session 2015–16), and again copy pasting from the notes I took on it.

- Focus on Manchester devolution deal, but very particular history there, the ten Greater Manchester authorities all have parallel powers with long history of working together, cover small area, have one 'core city' as major economic driver

- So much easier for them to make narrative to gov on why devolution is beneficial and necessary there, not a model for rest of country

I've got a lot more random notes from when I was studying this topic (local government, devolution generally but then also specifically English local devolution), so if you have more questions or want to know more, I have more things I can share :)",2020-07-06T22:30:05+00:00

**Another by-election looms as Parliament rises after Christmas.**

Chris Skidmore quit as an MP over the government's plans to allow more drilling in the North Sea, triggering a battle for his Kingswood seat.

**MPs will debate the plans Skidmore resigned over on Monday.**

The Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill steps up the number of licences awarded to oil and gas companies, which some say is the wrong move in the middle of a climate crisis. Green MP Caroline Lucas is among those hoping to move an amendment.

There's an Opposition Day scheduled, but no word yet what the topic will be.

### MONDAY 8 JANUARY

I am writing to co-propose Nate Higgins' Late Motion entitled ""Antisemitism Policy"". The text of this motion can be found below

Antisemitism Policy

Motion Synopsis

The need for a formal definition of antisemitism as part of our code of conduct, in order to combat the rising antisemitic sentiment in society and our political discourse, has become significant. This motion adds a formal definition of antisemitism to our members code of conduct.

Motion Text

Conference notes and is deeply concerned by current and rising levels of antisemitism in our society. Conference also notes the party’s responsibility to combat antisemitism and to take a strong stance against it. 

Conference also notes that the Green Party Executive has been deliberating whether to adopt a formal definition of antisemitism. In a statement on the 13th of August 2018, it was announced that the executive had decided not to adopt a formal definition at this time, saying “One argument was that such a significant decision ought to be taken by the wider membership and in close partnership with our Jewish members in particular”. 

Therefore conference resolves:

A) To create an antisemitism policy which can be amended by a motion to conference in section D of the agenda, passed by a simple majority, or by a majority vote of the Green Party Regional Council in consultation with relevant committees and stakeholders. Insert into it:

1. About the policy

1.1 There is often a lot of debate about what is and is not considered antisemitism, both within and external to the Green Party, and it is the purpose of this policy to provide a clear set of guidelines for members to follow in order to avoid perpetuating antisemitism and its associated tropes.

1.2 Unlike with some other kinds of discrimination, within the party there is not currently a widely understood and agreed idea of what constitutes antisemitism and what does not, and this policy addresses that.

1.3 When discussing complex issues such as the conflict between Israel and Palestine, it is helpful for members to have a reference to help them to ensure they are not unwittingly perpetuating antisemitism or inadvertently using language commonly associated with antisemitic tropes, which this policy provides. 

1.4 This policy draws on the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, and its associated examples, to provide a clear, internationally and domestically recognised definition of antisemitism to guide members.

1.5 This policy seeks to ensure that it is understood by members that this policy does not limit free speech and criticism of policies or actions of the Israeli government, military, or other state organisations, especially in regards to its treatment of the Palestinian people. For this, it draws on the clarifications issued by the United Kingdom Home Affairs Select Committee, in clauses 3.3 and 3.4.

1.6 It is important to recognise that this policy provides a working definition of antisemitism, and members are encouraged to develop on and amend this policy in order to improve its effectiveness.

1.7 In recognition that this policy provides only a working definition, this policy should be considered a guideline and not an exhaustive definition of antisemitism. Context and evidence should be considered during any application of this policy. 

1.8 This policy follows the Macpherson principle: that a racist incident is one perceived to be racist by the victim. Therefore, the perceptions of Jewish people, both as a collective and individually, should be the starting point for any application of this policy. Antisemitism still has to be proven by the criteria provided by this policy, but any accusations should be taken seriously and properly handled and investigated.

2. Scope

2.1 This policy on antisemitism applies to all members of the party, irrespective of any voluntary or professional position they may hold. It is supplementary to the Green Party Members Code of Conduct. It governs members’ behaviour with regard to respect for other members and the effect it has on the effective functioning of the Green Party. It may apply to behaviour towards people outside the party if it is thought to impact on the reputation or effective functioning of the party. It also governs the behaviour of members representing the party externally. 

2.2 As an addition to the Green Party Policy on Code of Conduct, this policy applies to any kind of communication covered in that document and may apply further, for example to the conduct of Green Party spokespeople.

2.3 This policy should be referred to during disputes and disciplinary procedures for complaints relating to antisemitism. 

3. Definition

3.1 Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.

3.2 Manifestations of anti-semitism might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for “why things go wrong.” It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.

3.3 It is not antisemitic to criticise the Government of Israel, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent.

3.4 It is not antisemitic to hold the Israeli Government to the same standards as other liberal democracies or to take a particular interest in the Israeli Government’s policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent.

4. Examples

4.1 The examples in this section apply only when they do not conflict with the definition of antisemitism outlined in section 3, particularly the clauses which specify what should not be considered antisemitic. They are provided for illustrative purposes to guide members and relevant committees and are not definitive. Section 3 remains the primary definition of antisemitism in this policy. Particular attention should be focused on where examples refer to criticism of a state of Israel, rather than the state of Israel. 

4.1 Contemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere could, taking into account the overall context, include, but are not limited to:

4.2 Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.

4.3 Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.

4.4 Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.

4.5 Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).

4.6 Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.

4.7 Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.

4.8 Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour.

4.9 Applying double standards by requiring of it a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.

4.10 Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.

4.11 Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.

4.12 Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.

5. Amending this policy

5.1 This policy is overseen by Green Party Regional Council and can only be amended by a motion to conference in section D of the agenda, passed by a simple majority, or by majority vote of the Green Party Regional Council in consultation with relevant committees and stakeholders, which may include Disputes Resolution Committee, Disciplinary Committee, the Executive Committee, and relevant staff.

B) To append this policy to the Members Code of Conduct, in the same way as the Policy on Bullying, Harassment, and Discrimination, such that breaching it will be grounds for a disciplinary complaint, and that it may be considered in disciplinary investigations and decisions.

""C) To insert into the Record of Organisational Statements:

Green Party Regional Council and Green Party Executive to undertake to adopt and implement the policy on antisemitism, including any necessary training as identified during implementation, by Spring Conference 2019.

UKGreens,post,Israel,1b4ij1i,JohnJD1302,I'm increasingly seeing the Rochdale by-election as a HUGE miss for the Greens,"Since the Commons seat of Rochdale was vacated following the unfortunate death of Sir Tony Lloyd, the by-election campaign there would turn out to be one of the most chaotic political events of the year in Britain, tragically resulting in the return to Parliament of the grifter, transphobe, Hezbollah-supporter, antisemite, and overall vile human being, George Galloway.

Rochdale has a Muslim population of around 30%, so it was inevitable that Gaza would be a major contention of this campaign, and that a candidate who is vocal in stopping the plight of Palestinians would have a good chance of taking the seat.

George Galloway's posturing as an anti-war candidates hides the fact of his climate change denial, his transphobia, his previous endorsement of Tories, and the fact that he was endorsed by Nick Griffin, the neofascist BNP leader. His campaign has even been accused of send two completely different messages to Muslims and non-Muslims, with two separate campaign letters sent to voters containing completely contradictory messaging, one of them echoing Trump-style rhetoric. This by-election should not be celebrated by any true progressive.

Which is why I find it tragic that the local Greens there have failed to capitalize on the fact that the Labour candidate was suspended for their comments on Israel. The Greens could have put out a candidate who would be a true progressive voice against the far-right Israeli government and be a representative of Rochdale's Muslim community, and expose the toxicity of Galloway's politics, while at the same time, represent non-Muslims by catering to local kitchen table issues, much like the independent candidate David Tully who came second.

Instead, the candidate they put out has only alienated the Muslim community. Even if such comments they made were in the past, it was only right these comments has surfaced, as one cannot be too wary of the character of any individual trying to represent constituents.

This lost was also a HUGE miss. If only the Greens had won this by-election, imagine the massive PR win of the Greens defeating Galloway. Progressives would've flock to the party, a massive flow of donations would've come their way, be a more serious threat to Starmer, and it may not have been very hard to hold on to that seat in the next GE.

This by-election stall and MUST serve an incredibly important lesson for the Green Party of England and Wales, if we were to try to get more MPs to counter the increasingly blurred two-party system, of Sunak's disastrous Tory government, and Starmer's Tory Lite Labour. Greens must being in Green values and adapt them to fit the needs of people where they run. Improved vetting of candidates must also be done, and that we shall campaign harder and harder, TOGETHER with other like-minded progressives, to stop this stagnant two-party system, get Britain back, and stop its support of the far-right Israeli state, and champion a free Palestine.",2024-03-02T07:25:36+00:00

Welcome back, hope you've had a great summer.

**MPs return to Westminster this week after recess.**

Of course they've already come back once, to debate Afghanistan  after Kabul fell to the Taliban. Now MPs face a full week of lawmaking,  with the Elections Bill as the highlight.

**Another theme is Universal Credit.**

The temporary £20 uplift is set to expire on 6 October.

Wednesday is an Opposition Day, so expect Labour to use that as  an opportunity to pressure the government into performing a U-turn.

**And private members' bills return after a pandemic pause.**

Remember, only a few of the private members' bills listed below  will be debated because of time constraints, and only the ones with  government backing tend to pass. That's the case for Mark Jenkinson's  bill, which extends careers guidance to children in year 7.

### MONDAY 6 SEPTEMBER

**National Insurance Contributions Bill - report stage and 3rd reading**  
Introduces tax relief for employers taking on employees in a  freeport, or hiring veterans who have left the armed forces within the  last year. Also exempts the self-employed from paying National Insurance  on £500 self-isolation support payments, bringing them in line with  employees (applies retroactively to the 2020/21 tax year).

### TUESDAY 7 SEPTEMBER

**Transport (Disabled Passenger Charter) Bill**  
Establishes a passenger charter for disabled public transport  passengers setting out their rights, the legal obligations of transport  operators, complaints procedures, passenger assistance schemes and  accessibility requirements. Aims to give disabled passengers the  information needed on how to complain when travel goes wrong. Ten minute  rule motion presented by Charlotte Nichols.

**Elections Bill - 2nd reading**  
Introduces new measures aimed at strengthening the integrity of  the electoral process, including requiring voters to show ID in General  Elections. Scraps the 15-year limit on voting for UK citizens living  overseas. Lays out new rules for EU citizens standing and voting in UK  elections. Requires digital campaign materials to show details of the  promoter of the materials (as is the case for printed materials).

### WEDNESDAY 8 SEPTEMBER

**Multi-Academy Trusts (OFSTED Inspection) Bill**  
Allows Ofsted to inspect the governing bodies of Multi-Academy  Trusts. Ten minute rule motion presented by Jonathan Gullis.

### THURSDAY 9 SEPTEMBER

**The Rating (Coronavirus) and Directors Disqualification (Dissolved Companies) Bill - report stage and 3rd reading**  
Clarifies that altering the use of a building because of the  pandemic (e.g. requirements to close or enforce social distancing)  doesn't count as a ""material change of circumstances"" for business rates  purposes. Many business owners had argued this because it can  lower their building's assumed rental value, potentially reducing  business rates in the future. Also closes a legal loophole by giving the  Insolvency Service powers to investigate the directors of dissolved  companies. Previously, some directors had fraudulently avoided repaying  government-backed coronavirus loans by closing down their businesses.

### FRIDAY 10 SEPTEMBER

**Education (Careers Guidance in Schools) Bill - 2nd reading**  
Requires state schools to provide careers guidance for children  throughout their secondary education. Currently, guidance does not have  to be provided until year 8. Private members' bill presented by Mark  Jenkinson.

It's intended to  alleviate concerns from museums and international lenders that cultural  objects may be left unprotected if there are travel disruptions, e.g.  those caused by the pandemic. Private members' bill presented by Mel  Stride.

**Miniature Mobile Phones (Prohibition of Sale) Bill - 2nd reading**  
Bans the sale of mini mobile phones designed to be smuggled into  prisons. Private members' bill presented by Sarah Atherton.

**The Nationality and Borders Bill returns to the Commons this week.**

This is the stage when amendments are heard. As ever, it's up to the Speaker to select them.

A wide-ranging bill reforming UK immigration laws after Brexit.

**Time is really tight.**

I've mentioned it a lot in the past few weeks: the current parliamentary session is expected to end in April. Now there's some speculation that ministers might be forced to drop some legislation to get the rest of it through before then.

UKGreens,post,Palestine,1b4ij1i,JohnJD1302,I'm increasingly seeing the Rochdale by-election as a HUGE miss for the Greens,"Since the Commons seat of Rochdale was vacated following the unfortunate death of Sir Tony Lloyd, the by-election campaign there would turn out to be one of the most chaotic political events of the year in Britain, tragically resulting in the return to Parliament of the grifter, transphobe, Hezbollah-supporter, antisemite, and overall vile human being, George Galloway.

Rochdale has a Muslim population of around 30%, so it was inevitable that Gaza would be a major contention of this campaign, and that a candidate who is vocal in stopping the plight of Palestinians would have a good chance of taking the seat.

George Galloway's posturing as an anti-war candidates hides the fact of his climate change denial, his transphobia, his previous endorsement of Tories, and the fact that he was endorsed by Nick Griffin, the neofascist BNP leader. His campaign has even been accused of send two completely different messages to Muslims and non-Muslims, with two separate campaign letters sent to voters containing completely contradictory messaging, one of them echoing Trump-style rhetoric. This by-election should not be celebrated by any true progressive.

Which is why I find it tragic that the local Greens there have failed to capitalize on the fact that the Labour candidate was suspended for their comments on Israel. The Greens could have put out a candidate who would be a true progressive voice against the far-right Israeli government and be a representative of Rochdale's Muslim community, and expose the toxicity of Galloway's politics, while at the same time, represent non-Muslims by catering to local kitchen table issues, much like the independent candidate David Tully who came second.

Instead, the candidate they put out has only alienated the Muslim community. Even if such comments they made were in the past, it was only right these comments has surfaced, as one cannot be too wary of the character of any individual trying to represent constituents.

This lost was also a HUGE miss. If only the Greens had won this by-election, imagine the massive PR win of the Greens defeating Galloway. Progressives would've flock to the party, a massive flow of donations would've come their way, be a more serious threat to Starmer, and it may not have been very hard to hold on to that seat in the next GE.

This by-election stall and MUST serve an incredibly important lesson for the Green Party of England and Wales, if we were to try to get more MPs to counter the increasingly blurred two-party system, of Sunak's disastrous Tory government, and Starmer's Tory Lite Labour. Greens must being in Green values and adapt them to fit the needs of people where they run. Improved vetting of candidates must also be done, and that we shall campaign harder and harder, TOGETHER with other like-minded progressives, to stop this stagnant two-party system, get Britain back, and stop its support of the far-right Israeli state, and champion a free Palestine.",2024-03-02T07:25:36+00:00

I am writing to co-propose Nate Higgins' Late Motion entitled ""Antisemitism Policy"". The text of this motion can be found below

Antisemitism Policy

Motion Synopsis

The need for a formal definition of antisemitism as part of our code of conduct, in order to combat the rising antisemitic sentiment in society and our political discourse, has become significant. This motion adds a formal definition of antisemitism to our members code of conduct.

Motion Text

Conference notes and is deeply concerned by current and rising levels of antisemitism in our society. Conference also notes the party’s responsibility to combat antisemitism and to take a strong stance against it. 

Conference also notes that the Green Party Executive has been deliberating whether to adopt a formal definition of antisemitism. In a statement on the 13th of August 2018, it was announced that the executive had decided not to adopt a formal definition at this time, saying “One argument was that such a significant decision ought to be taken by the wider membership and in close partnership with our Jewish members in particular”. 

Therefore conference resolves:

A) To create an antisemitism policy which can be amended by a motion to conference in section D of the agenda, passed by a simple majority, or by a majority vote of the Green Party Regional Council in consultation with relevant committees and stakeholders. Insert into it:

1. About the policy

1.1 There is often a lot of debate about what is and is not considered antisemitism, both within and external to the Green Party, and it is the purpose of this policy to provide a clear set of guidelines for members to follow in order to avoid perpetuating antisemitism and its associated tropes.

1.2 Unlike with some other kinds of discrimination, within the party there is not currently a widely understood and agreed idea of what constitutes antisemitism and what does not, and this policy addresses that.

1.3 When discussing complex issues such as the conflict between Israel and Palestine, it is helpful for members to have a reference to help them to ensure they are not unwittingly perpetuating antisemitism or inadvertently using language commonly associated with antisemitic tropes, which this policy provides. 

1.4 This policy draws on the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, and its associated examples, to provide a clear, internationally and domestically recognised definition of antisemitism to guide members.

1.5 This policy seeks to ensure that it is understood by members that this policy does not limit free speech and criticism of policies or actions of the Israeli government, military, or other state organisations, especially in regards to its treatment of the Palestinian people. For this, it draws on the clarifications issued by the United Kingdom Home Affairs Select Committee, in clauses 3.3 and 3.4.

1.6 It is important to recognise that this policy provides a working definition of antisemitism, and members are encouraged to develop on and amend this policy in order to improve its effectiveness.

1.7 In recognition that this policy provides only a working definition, this policy should be considered a guideline and not an exhaustive definition of antisemitism. Context and evidence should be considered during any application of this policy. 

1.8 This policy follows the Macpherson principle: that a racist incident is one perceived to be racist by the victim. Therefore, the perceptions of Jewish people, both as a collective and individually, should be the starting point for any application of this policy. Antisemitism still has to be proven by the criteria provided by this policy, but any accusations should be taken seriously and properly handled and investigated.

2. Scope

2.1 This policy on antisemitism applies to all members of the party, irrespective of any voluntary or professional position they may hold. It is supplementary to the Green Party Members Code of Conduct. It governs members’ behaviour with regard to respect for other members and the effect it has on the effective functioning of the Green Party. It may apply to behaviour towards people outside the party if it is thought to impact on the reputation or effective functioning of the party. It also governs the behaviour of members representing the party externally. 

2.2 As an addition to the Green Party Policy on Code of Conduct, this policy applies to any kind of communication covered in that document and may apply further, for example to the conduct of Green Party spokespeople.

2.3 This policy should be referred to during disputes and disciplinary procedures for complaints relating to antisemitism. 

3. Definition

3.1 Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.

3.2 Manifestations of anti-semitism might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for “why things go wrong.” It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.

3.3 It is not antisemitic to criticise the Government of Israel, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent.

3.4 It is not antisemitic to hold the Israeli Government to the same standards as other liberal democracies or to take a particular interest in the Israeli Government’s policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent.

4. Examples

4.1 The examples in this section apply only when they do not conflict with the definition of antisemitism outlined in section 3, particularly the clauses which specify what should not be considered antisemitic. They are provided for illustrative purposes to guide members and relevant committees and are not definitive. Section 3 remains the primary definition of antisemitism in this policy. Particular attention should be focused on where examples refer to criticism of a state of Israel, rather than the state of Israel. 

4.1 Contemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere could, taking into account the overall context, include, but are not limited to:

4.2 Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.

4.3 Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.

4.4 Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.

4.5 Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).

4.6 Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.

4.7 Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.

4.8 Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour.

4.9 Applying double standards by requiring of it a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.

4.10 Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.

4.11 Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.

4.12 Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.

5. Amending this policy

5.1 This policy is overseen by Green Party Regional Council and can only be amended by a motion to conference in section D of the agenda, passed by a simple majority, or by majority vote of the Green Party Regional Council in consultation with relevant committees and stakeholders, which may include Disputes Resolution Committee, Disciplinary Committee, the Executive Committee, and relevant staff.

B) To append this policy to the Members Code of Conduct, in the same way as the Policy on Bullying, Harassment, and Discrimination, such that breaching it will be grounds for a disciplinary complaint, and that it may be considered in disciplinary investigations and decisions.

""C) To insert into the Record of Organisational Statements:

Green Party Regional Council and Green Party Executive to undertake to adopt and implement the policy on antisemitism, including any necessary training as identified during implementation, by Spring Conference 2019.

UKGreens,post,Israel-Palestine,1b4ij1i,JohnJD1302,I'm increasingly seeing the Rochdale by-election as a HUGE miss for the Greens,"Since the Commons seat of Rochdale was vacated following the unfortunate death of Sir Tony Lloyd, the by-election campaign there would turn out to be one of the most chaotic political events of the year in Britain, tragically resulting in the return to Parliament of the grifter, transphobe, Hezbollah-supporter, antisemite, and overall vile human being, George Galloway.

Rochdale has a Muslim population of around 30%, so it was inevitable that Gaza would be a major contention of this campaign, and that a candidate who is vocal in stopping the plight of Palestinians would have a good chance of taking the seat.

George Galloway's posturing as an anti-war candidates hides the fact of his climate change denial, his transphobia, his previous endorsement of Tories, and the fact that he was endorsed by Nick Griffin, the neofascist BNP leader. His campaign has even been accused of send two completely different messages to Muslims and non-Muslims, with two separate campaign letters sent to voters containing completely contradictory messaging, one of them echoing Trump-style rhetoric. This by-election should not be celebrated by any true progressive.

Which is why I find it tragic that the local Greens there have failed to capitalize on the fact that the Labour candidate was suspended for their comments on Israel. The Greens could have put out a candidate who would be a true progressive voice against the far-right Israeli government and be a representative of Rochdale's Muslim community, and expose the toxicity of Galloway's politics, while at the same time, represent non-Muslims by catering to local kitchen table issues, much like the independent candidate David Tully who came second.

Instead, the candidate they put out has only alienated the Muslim community. Even if such comments they made were in the past, it was only right these comments has surfaced, as one cannot be too wary of the character of any individual trying to represent constituents.

This lost was also a HUGE miss. If only the Greens had won this by-election, imagine the massive PR win of the Greens defeating Galloway. Progressives would've flock to the party, a massive flow of donations would've come their way, be a more serious threat to Starmer, and it may not have been very hard to hold on to that seat in the next GE.

This by-election stall and MUST serve an incredibly important lesson for the Green Party of England and Wales, if we were to try to get more MPs to counter the increasingly blurred two-party system, of Sunak's disastrous Tory government, and Starmer's Tory Lite Labour. Greens must being in Green values and adapt them to fit the needs of people where they run. Improved vetting of candidates must also be done, and that we shall campaign harder and harder, TOGETHER with other like-minded progressives, to stop this stagnant two-party system, get Britain back, and stop its support of the far-right Israeli state, and champion a free Palestine.",2024-03-02T07:25:36+00:00

Antisemitism Policy

Motion Synopsis

The need for a formal definition of antisemitism as part of our code of conduct, in order to combat the rising antisemitic sentiment in society and our political discourse, has become significant. This motion adds a formal definition of antisemitism to our members code of conduct.

Motion Text

Conference notes and is deeply concerned by current and rising levels of antisemitism in our society. Conference also notes the party’s responsibility to combat antisemitism and to take a strong stance against it. 

Conference also notes that the Green Party Executive has been deliberating whether to adopt a formal definition of antisemitism. In a statement on the 13th of August 2018, it was announced that the executive had decided not to adopt a formal definition at this time, saying “One argument was that such a significant decision ought to be taken by the wider membership and in close partnership with our Jewish members in particular”. 

Therefore conference resolves:

A) To create an antisemitism policy which can be amended by a motion to conference in section D of the agenda, passed by a simple majority, or by a majority vote of the Green Party Regional Council in consultation with relevant committees and stakeholders. Insert into it:

1. About the policy

1.1 There is often a lot of debate about what is and is not considered antisemitism, both within and external to the Green Party, and it is the purpose of this policy to provide a clear set of guidelines for members to follow in order to avoid perpetuating antisemitism and its associated tropes.

1.2 Unlike with some other kinds of discrimination, within the party there is not currently a widely understood and agreed idea of what constitutes antisemitism and what does not, and this policy addresses that.

1.3 When discussing complex issues such as the conflict between Israel and Palestine, it is helpful for members to have a reference to help them to ensure they are not unwittingly perpetuating antisemitism or inadvertently using language commonly associated with antisemitic tropes, which this policy provides. 

1.4 This policy draws on the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, and its associated examples, to provide a clear, internationally and domestically recognised definition of antisemitism to guide members.

1.5 This policy seeks to ensure that it is understood by members that this policy does not limit free speech and criticism of policies or actions of the Israeli government, military, or other state organisations, especially in regards to its treatment of the Palestinian people. For this, it draws on the clarifications issued by the United Kingdom Home Affairs Select Committee, in clauses 3.3 and 3.4.

1.6 It is important to recognise that this policy provides a working definition of antisemitism, and members are encouraged to develop on and amend this policy in order to improve its effectiveness.

1.7 In recognition that this policy provides only a working definition, this policy should be considered a guideline and not an exhaustive definition of antisemitism. Context and evidence should be considered during any application of this policy. 

1.8 This policy follows the Macpherson principle: that a racist incident is one perceived to be racist by the victim. Therefore, the perceptions of Jewish people, both as a collective and individually, should be the starting point for any application of this policy. Antisemitism still has to be proven by the criteria provided by this policy, but any accusations should be taken seriously and properly handled and investigated.

2. Scope

2.1 This policy on antisemitism applies to all members of the party, irrespective of any voluntary or professional position they may hold. It is supplementary to the Green Party Members Code of Conduct. It governs members’ behaviour with regard to respect for other members and the effect it has on the effective functioning of the Green Party. It may apply to behaviour towards people outside the party if it is thought to impact on the reputation or effective functioning of the party. It also governs the behaviour of members representing the party externally. 

2.2 As an addition to the Green Party Policy on Code of Conduct, this policy applies to any kind of communication covered in that document and may apply further, for example to the conduct of Green Party spokespeople.

2.3 This policy should be referred to during disputes and disciplinary procedures for complaints relating to antisemitism. 

3. Definition

3.1 Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.

3.2 Manifestations of anti-semitism might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for “why things go wrong.” It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.

3.3 It is not antisemitic to criticise the Government of Israel, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent.

3.4 It is not antisemitic to hold the Israeli Government to the same standards as other liberal democracies or to take a particular interest in the Israeli Government’s policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent.

4. Examples

4.1 The examples in this section apply only when they do not conflict with the definition of antisemitism outlined in section 3, particularly the clauses which specify what should not be considered antisemitic. They are provided for illustrative purposes to guide members and relevant committees and are not definitive. Section 3 remains the primary definition of antisemitism in this policy. Particular attention should be focused on where examples refer to criticism of a state of Israel, rather than the state of Israel. 

4.1 Contemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere could, taking into account the overall context, include, but are not limited to:

4.2 Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.

4.3 Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.

4.4 Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.

4.5 Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).

4.6 Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.

4.7 Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.

4.8 Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour.

4.9 Applying double standards by requiring of it a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.

4.10 Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.

4.11 Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.

4.12 Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.

5. Amending this policy

5.1 This policy is overseen by Green Party Regional Council and can only be amended by a motion to conference in section D of the agenda, passed by a simple majority, or by majority vote of the Green Party Regional Council in consultation with relevant committees and stakeholders, which may include Disputes Resolution Committee, Disciplinary Committee, the Executive Committee, and relevant staff.

B) To append this policy to the Members Code of Conduct, in the same way as the Policy on Bullying, Harassment, and Discrimination, such that breaching it will be grounds for a disciplinary complaint, and that it may be considered in disciplinary investigations and decisions.

""C) To insert into the Record of Organisational Statements:

Green Party Regional Council and Green Party Executive to undertake to adopt and implement the policy on antisemitism, including any necessary training as identified during implementation, by Spring Conference 2019.

UKGreens,post,Gaza,1b4ij1i,JohnJD1302,I'm increasingly seeing the Rochdale by-election as a HUGE miss for the Greens,"Since the Commons seat of Rochdale was vacated following the unfortunate death of Sir Tony Lloyd, the by-election campaign there would turn out to be one of the most chaotic political events of the year in Britain, tragically resulting in the return to Parliament of the grifter, transphobe, Hezbollah-supporter, antisemite, and overall vile human being, George Galloway.

Rochdale has a Muslim population of around 30%, so it was inevitable that Gaza would be a major contention of this campaign, and that a candidate who is vocal in stopping the plight of Palestinians would have a good chance of taking the seat.

George Galloway's posturing as an anti-war candidates hides the fact of his climate change denial, his transphobia, his previous endorsement of Tories, and the fact that he was endorsed by Nick Griffin, the neofascist BNP leader. His campaign has even been accused of send two completely different messages to Muslims and non-Muslims, with two separate campaign letters sent to voters containing completely contradictory messaging, one of them echoing Trump-style rhetoric. This by-election should not be celebrated by any true progressive.

Which is why I find it tragic that the local Greens there have failed to capitalize on the fact that the Labour candidate was suspended for their comments on Israel. The Greens could have put out a candidate who would be a true progressive voice against the far-right Israeli government and be a representative of Rochdale's Muslim community, and expose the toxicity of Galloway's politics, while at the same time, represent non-Muslims by catering to local kitchen table issues, much like the independent candidate David Tully who came second.

Instead, the candidate they put out has only alienated the Muslim community. Even if such comments they made were in the past, it was only right these comments has surfaced, as one cannot be too wary of the character of any individual trying to represent constituents.

This lost was also a HUGE miss. If only the Greens had won this by-election, imagine the massive PR win of the Greens defeating Galloway. Progressives would've flock to the party, a massive flow of donations would've come their way, be a more serious threat to Starmer, and it may not have been very hard to hold on to that seat in the next GE.

This by-election stall and MUST serve an incredibly important lesson for the Green Party of England and Wales, if we were to try to get more MPs to counter the increasingly blurred two-party system, of Sunak's disastrous Tory government, and Starmer's Tory Lite Labour. Greens must being in Green values and adapt them to fit the needs of people where they run. Improved vetting of candidates must also be done, and that we shall campaign harder and harder, TOGETHER with other like-minded progressives, to stop this stagnant two-party system, get Britain back, and stop its support of the far-right Israeli state, and champion a free Palestine.",2024-03-02T07:25:36+00:00

UKGreens,post,Protest,150fd9p,GroovyGizmo,A Plea to Green Protesters,"On the current green protest movement, please consider:

The disproportionate impact of day to day chaos and disorder on the poor compared to the relatively insulated wealthy class.

The tendency of this disproportionate impact to push poor people towards the right wing conception of retributive justice (law and order) & anti-environmentalism.


Extinction rebellion block roadways and delay flights, ordinary people suffer and come to think of the left/greens as a group which not only directly inconveniences them, but it also holds them personally responsible for global issues which cannot be resolved by individual actions.

This pushes ordinary people away from the movement, in a misguided attempt to make the population, independently and en masse, change their ways to a more sustainable lifestyle.

All the while it isn't clear that it would be enough to significantly improve the climate predicament, even if everyone in the west changed their habits and lifestyle overnight.

Imagine if, instead of penalizing the powerless members of the public, the left & greens took a law and order spin on the issue, they could present themselves as the side which could not only protect the people from the ecological disaster through legislation and enforcement of systemic change, but could bring justice to the individuals and companies truly most responsible for the problem.

Protest at the homes of BP executives, under the framing of seeking justice and order.
Occupy company and political offices associated with the most environmental damage.
Don't block the public roadways as people drive to work.
Make the concept of law and order work FOR the cause rather than against it.",2023-07-15T15:49:03+00:00
UKGreens,comment,Protest,js4bkum,willmorgan,,"OK, I'll bite - out of the numerous things wrong with this post, let me just remind you a few things:

* In the last 2 weeks, Just Stop Oil have protested at the BBC Proms and Wimbledon. Both events aren't exactly regarded as ubiquitous with the common person.
* At the moment it would appear that the main threat to flights is ATC and airport staff strikes, not people gluing themselves to runways.
* These ""powerless members of the public"" voted in the Tories who have basically defunded the UK's response to the climate crisis...

The terminal issue with your idea is that the left and greens aren't in government, so I'm failing to see how serious legislative progress can be made. Michael Gove, the government minister who is literally in charge of housing, this week voluntarily handed back his departmental budget to central government...... rather than using it to start insulating homes.

Unless everyone is made acutely aware of the problem to the extent that we start taking it seriously every day, we'll just have to get used to more parts of the UK eroding into the sea (let alone entire nations), and fun things like forking out billions to replace infrastructure like the Thames Barrier, which is falling into disrepair and redundancy due to increasing numbers of cycles and tidal levels.

It's easy to outsource responsibility to the government, but ultimately we all, for better or worse, vote them in. And fundamentally you can't outsource all responsibility to the state - you still have to do your bit. Just because there's a refuse collection service doesn't mean you can throw your shit in the street.",2023-07-15T22:27:15+00:00

UKGreens,comment,Protest,js4egll,GroovyGizmo,,"All those events are enjoyed by people from all walks of life. Disrupting them does not win hearts.

Also, the common person, in the context of my point is pretty much everybody who isn't a politician, business or wealthy individual directly involved in the industries which contribute disproportionately to the problem.

I am not saying that the protests are causing rampant chaos everywhere all the time. 

Surely you can see in your daily life? The reactions to protests which deliberately target the general public as the subject of protest are intensely negative.
It is seriously harming the cause, even if there have really only been a few handfuls of events like this.

I am also annoyed at the public for making wrong decisions, in electing the Tories, but how can we hope to achieve a healthy democracy based on a notion that the people don't have the capacity to make good choices?

The issue is the movement is having to fight an uphill battle against the momentum of global industry and finance, with all the political and media influence they have.
Anything they are handed they will take, and these types of protest are a free victory for anti-environmentalists.

I am for radical action against targets who are radically responsible.

Of course they aren't in government, but the lefts and greens want to be in government. I'm arguing for radical and carefully targeted justice with regard to the climate issue, along with proposals for massive regulatory changes, as a better way to win minds and hopefully elections.

Use the language of shame and criminality to describe those whose actions and decisions cause  more pollution than the ordinary person would in a hundred thousand lifetimes.

You have to provide an enemy to the public to rally against, not make a multitude of enemies out of each individual in society.

I should stress, the Tories and red-tory labour members should be included on this enemy list.

I can't see how this sort of disruption is much different to strikes, which I hope you'll agree, are mostly worth supporting these days. It's a civil form of protest. It's not violent, it's annoying. It's supposed to be.

Of course I support strikes and unions in general.
However the disruptions that strikes cause for the public are not the primary motivation of strikes.
The strike causes disruption with the relevant business, industry or sector as the target. The public disruption is secondary and helps to put pressure upon the actual target.

Strikes are meant to exert influence on the powerful t change their mind, with the public disruption as a pressuring force, but not in itself the intended outcome.

Targeting specific companies, politicians, industries etc would cause some public disruption as byproduct but it would be harder to construe as an attack against the public, when the protest is ostensibly against the industry and not the public.",2023-07-15T23:14:06+00:00

**It's the last week before recess, but things are far from sleepy.**

MPs will debate two government bills that introduce major reforms to immigration and building safety policy. Details of both below.

**And as the country unlocks, COVID restrictions will be relaxed in the Commons.**

Some social distancing measures will be removed, like barriers closing off benches. Mask wearing will no longer be compulsory, though it will be ""encouraged"".

MPs will still be able to take part in debates virtually, though. The call list system remains in place, so MPs will know in advance if they will have a chance to speak, and in what order. The proxy voting system also continues.

### MONDAY 19 JULY

**Nationality and Borders Bill - 2nd reading**  
A wide-ranging bill reforming UK immigration laws after Brexit. Among other things: overhauls the system for asylum seekers, creating a new Temporary Protection Status for people who enter the UK illegally. (This will restrict family reunion rights and holders would have no recourse to public funds unless destitute.) Allows asylum seekers to be removed to a safe third country before their application for asylum is considered. Lowers the threshold for deportation for committing a criminal offence.

### TUESDAY 20 JULY

**Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Bill**

**Nationality and Borders Bill - 2nd reading**  
As above.

### WEDNESDAY 21 JULY

Enables the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (a body which investigates complaints about government departments) to investigate advice and information given by the government about transfers of pensions from the UK Atomic Energy Authority schemes to the AEA Technology pension scheme. AEA Technology was formed in 1996 when an offshoot of the Atomic Energy Authority was privatised. Employees were given a choice of two new pension schemes, which they were told would be at least as good as the old one, but some have said the difference in risk was not made clear. [More information here.](http://aeat.pensioncampaign.info/story/) Ten minute rule motion presented by David Johnston.

**Building Safety Bill - 2nd reading**  
Implements recommendations from the Hackitt Review into building regulations and fire safety, commissioned after the Grenfell Tower fire. Among other things: creates the Building Safety Regulator, a body responsible for overseeing the safety and performance of all buildings. Introduces a ""gateway"" system, whereby building safety risks are considered at each stage of a building’s planning and design, construction, and pre-occupation.

**MPs are back at it from Tuesday.**

There's no shortage of topics to catch up on. Members will want  to hear from ministers on the war in Ukraine and plans to send some  asylum seekers to Rwanda.

Opposition parties will no doubt want to put pressure on the government over the latest partygate revelations.

**While MPs have been away, the Lords have been tinkering.**

The seemingly endless back and forth hasn't let up.

Peers have made sweeping changes to flagship government bills:

* In the Nationality and Borders Bill, they doubled down -  among other things - on an amendment to give victims of modern slavery a  year's leave to remain in the UK.
* In the Health and Care Bill, changed include banning products tainted by genocide.
* They've also watered down voter ID requirements in the Elections Bill.

As ever, the clock is ticking...

**And there's a new piece of legislation: Online Safety Bill.**

This is first of its kind, complex, and controversial. In short  it requires social media sites and search engines to protect users from  harmful content, with potentially huge punishments if they don't. One  criticism has been the unclear nature of the term ""harmful content"",  which some argue will cause the sites to overcompensate and drastically  censor the content users see.

And for those of you thinking that it's a bit late in the  parliamentary session to introduce new legislation, this one will be  carried over, with the plan to get it through committee stage in June.

### TUESDAY 19 APRIL

**Sewage Discharges Bill**  
Sets mandatory targets and timescales for ending sewage discharges  into waterways and coastal areas. Gives Ofwat (the regulator for the  water and sewage industries) the power to enforce these.

Requires water companies to have at least one representative of an  environmental group on their boards. Ten minute rule motion presented by  Tim Farron.

**Online Safety Bill - 2nd reading**  
Puts a duty of care on companies hosting user-generated content  (e.g. social media sites) and search engines to illegal content, content  that's harmful to children, and content that's legal but harmful to  adults. Gives Ofcom powers to fine companies up to 10% of annual global  revenues if they don't comply, force them to improve their practices,  or block them completely.

### WEDNESDAY 20 APRIL

**Hereditary Titles (Female Succession) Bill**  
 Allows female heirs to inherit hereditary titles. Currently fewer  than 90 peerages can be inherited by a female heir. Ten minute rule  motion presented by Harriett Baldwin.

**Subsidy Control Bill - consideration of Lords amendments**  
reates a legal framework to allow public authorities, including  devolved administrations and local councils, to deliver subsidies to  businesses. Aims to give them more flexibility meet local needs around  levelling up, achieving net-zero carbon, and supporting economic  recovery from the pandemic. This replaces EU state aid rules.

**Building Safety Bill - consideration of Lords amendments**  
Implements recommendations from the Hackitt Review into building  regulations and fire safety, commissioned after the Grenfell Tower fire.  Among other things: creates the Building Safety Regulator, a body  responsible for overseeing the safety and performance of all buildings.  Introduces a ""gateway"" system, whereby building safety risks are  considered at each stage of a building’s planning and design,  construction, and pre-occupation.

Allows asylum seekers to be  removed to a safe third country before their application for asylum is  considered. Lowers the threshold for deportation for committing a  criminal offence.

### THURSDAY 21 APRIL

**Judicial Review and Courts Bill - consideration of Lords amendments**  
Reforms judicial review (where judges decide whether an action  taken by a public body was lawful) and other bits of the legal system.  Among other things, it introduces an online-only conviction procedure  for defendants pleading guilty so they don't have to go through a court.

**Well that was a dramatic week in Parliament.**

Not since the Brexit days have parliamentary procedures come under so much scrutiny. Speaker Lindsay Hoyle looks safe in his position for now, but that could change if dissatisfaction spreads among Tory backbenchers.

**This week sees the return of leasehold reform efforts.**

It's a long time coming, and would go some way towards fixing England's unique leasehold system. Housing campaigners have been more critical, calling it ""[insultingly modest](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/insultingly-modest-leasehold-reform-bill-does-nothing-for-flat-owners-report-says-83782).""

**Let's face it, Parliament is not where the drama is this week.**

**The controversial Online Safety Bill is back.**

**Another week, more drama for Boris Johnson.**

On top of partygate, the prime minister now faces accusations of Islamophobia and blackmail within his ranks.

In Parliament, we could see Tories express their discontent by voting against the government.

Once Sue Gray's report drops, we could see lots of rejigging to account for lengthy debates on its findings.

**The plan as it stands is to press on with the government's agenda.**

We see a new bill introduced this week tackling privacy concerns over smart devices like TVs and speakers.

**MPs are back on Monday from recess, and there's a lot to do.**

The end of the parliamentary year is looming - the government is likely to prorogue Parliament at the end of April - and big pieces of legislation like the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill haven't been passed yet.

The Skills and Post-16 Education Bill, which reforms the technical education system, nears the end of its parliamentary journey.

**And momentum to oust Boris Johnson seems to have slowed.**

UKGreens,post,Annexation,mjo2bx,GreenDaveP,Free promo from Conservative Candidates!,"Epping Forest Green Party is strong in Buckhurst Hill, particularly in Buckhurst Hill East Ward where both District Councillors are Green. One of those two is also a Buckhurst Hill Parish Councillor.  


In May the other of those two is defending his District Council seat and standing for County.  


This 'ere leaflet has been dropping through Buckhurst Hill letter boxes...

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yylsf9bpr2r61.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6df2bc35264b9b5bcb30bab8595b1e994fe4ba1e

&#x200B;

Some of it is guff (Ministry for Peace, Prevent Home Ownership), some of it is meaningless without context (Tax you more) and one part is in response to a local issue (the Clean Air Zone bit, which I explain below.)

  
However, the rest of it seems pretty solid.  


Thanks Epping Forest's Conservative Candidates!  


This is background to the Clean Air Zone bit, originally posted as a reply to a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/sarahgoodfello9/status/1378288427913904129), hence the typos and being split into chunks of 280 characters or fewer:

\[1/7\]Hi,

The Clean Air Zones mention isn't as random as it appears. For context here's a bit of very simplified local backgound, which I've tried to keep balanced:

&#x200B;

🌱 Much of Epping Forest District & constituency is part of the Epping Forest Special Area of Conservation - EFSAC

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\[2/7\]  🌱 The District's Local Plan calls for at least 11,400 new homes to be built

&#x200B;

🌱 Following advice from Natural England the District Council currently has a moratorium on planning applications that would increase traffic within 200m of the EFSAC. 

&#x200B;

\[3/7\] 🌱 Some Conservative District Councillors have argued that this moratorium is preventing people from building granny flats, annexes, other extensions and similar work on their homes, thus affecting local builders and associated builders. A Freedom of Information request 

&#x200B;

\[4/7\] from the LRA\* confirmed that as guff. Buildes have rarely been busier. 

&#x200B;

🌱 An Interim Air Pollution Mitigation Strategy (IAPMS) has been prepared with the hope that it will persuade Natural England to allow a resumption of medium - to - large scale housing development. 

&#x200B;

\[5/7\] 🌱 One element of the IAPMS is a Clean Air Zone (CAZ) which, if implimented, could have a massive effect on local businesses and households, paricularly given our district's lack of public transport alternatives to private vehicles.

&#x200B;

\[6/7\] 🌱 Epping Forest Green Party District Councillors oppose this CAZ, though we obviously support them in principle. The flyer conflates national policy with local decision making.

&#x200B;

\* LRA - Loughton Residents Association, the largest non-Conservative group on EFDC

&#x200B;

\[7/7\] There's much. much more to it - including insults directed a residents, and personal insults directed at Councillors, in council meetings, and District Council facilities being used for party political proaganda - but that's the basics as I understand them.",2021-04-04T03:29:21+00:00

UKGreens,post,Israel-Palestine War/War,1b4ij1i,JohnJD1302,I'm increasingly seeing the Rochdale by-election as a HUGE miss for the Greens,"Since the Commons seat of Rochdale was vacated following the unfortunate death of Sir Tony Lloyd, the by-election campaign there would turn out to be one of the most chaotic political events of the year in Britain, tragically resulting in the return to Parliament of the grifter, transphobe, Hezbollah-supporter, antisemite, and overall vile human being, George Galloway.

Rochdale has a Muslim population of around 30%, so it was inevitable that Gaza would be a major contention of this campaign, and that a candidate who is vocal in stopping the plight of Palestinians would have a good chance of taking the seat.

George Galloway's posturing as an anti-war candidates hides the fact of his climate change denial, his transphobia, his previous endorsement of Tories, and the fact that he was endorsed by Nick Griffin, the neofascist BNP leader. His campaign has even been accused of send two completely different messages to Muslims and non-Muslims, with two separate campaign letters sent to voters containing completely contradictory messaging, one of them echoing Trump-style rhetoric. This by-election should not be celebrated by any true progressive.

Which is why I find it tragic that the local Greens there have failed to capitalize on the fact that the Labour candidate was suspended for their comments on Israel. The Greens could have put out a candidate who would be a true progressive voice against the far-right Israeli government and be a representative of Rochdale's Muslim community, and expose the toxicity of Galloway's politics, while at the same time, represent non-Muslims by catering to local kitchen table issues, much like the independent candidate David Tully who came second.

Instead, the candidate they put out has only alienated the Muslim community. Even if such comments they made were in the past, it was only right these comments has surfaced, as one cannot be too wary of the character of any individual trying to represent constituents.

This lost was also a HUGE miss. If only the Greens had won this by-election, imagine the massive PR win of the Greens defeating Galloway. Progressives would've flock to the party, a massive flow of donations would've come their way, be a more serious threat to Starmer, and it may not have been very hard to hold on to that seat in the next GE.

This by-election stall and MUST serve an incredibly important lesson for the Green Party of England and Wales, if we were to try to get more MPs to counter the increasingly blurred two-party system, of Sunak's disastrous Tory government, and Starmer's Tory Lite Labour. Greens must being in Green values and adapt them to fit the needs of people where they run. Improved vetting of candidates must also be done, and that we shall campaign harder and harder, TOGETHER with other like-minded progressives, to stop this stagnant two-party system, get Britain back, and stop its support of the far-right Israeli state, and champion a free Palestine.",2024-03-02T07:25:36+00:00

Antisemitism Policy

Motion Synopsis

The need for a formal definition of antisemitism as part of our code of conduct, in order to combat the rising antisemitic sentiment in society and our political discourse, has become significant. This motion adds a formal definition of antisemitism to our members code of conduct.

Motion Text

Conference notes and is deeply concerned by current and rising levels of antisemitism in our society. Conference also notes the party’s responsibility to combat antisemitism and to take a strong stance against it. 

Conference also notes that the Green Party Executive has been deliberating whether to adopt a formal definition of antisemitism. In a statement on the 13th of August 2018, it was announced that the executive had decided not to adopt a formal definition at this time, saying “One argument was that such a significant decision ought to be taken by the wider membership and in close partnership with our Jewish members in particular”. 

Therefore conference resolves:

A) To create an antisemitism policy which can be amended by a motion to conference in section D of the agenda, passed by a simple majority, or by a majority vote of the Green Party Regional Council in consultation with relevant committees and stakeholders. Insert into it:

1. About the policy

1.1 There is often a lot of debate about what is and is not considered antisemitism, both within and external to the Green Party, and it is the purpose of this policy to provide a clear set of guidelines for members to follow in order to avoid perpetuating antisemitism and its associated tropes.

1.2 Unlike with some other kinds of discrimination, within the party there is not currently a widely understood and agreed idea of what constitutes antisemitism and what does not, and this policy addresses that.

1.3 When discussing complex issues such as the conflict between Israel and Palestine, it is helpful for members to have a reference to help them to ensure they are not unwittingly perpetuating antisemitism or inadvertently using language commonly associated with antisemitic tropes, which this policy provides. 

1.4 This policy draws on the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, and its associated examples, to provide a clear, internationally and domestically recognised definition of antisemitism to guide members.

1.5 This policy seeks to ensure that it is understood by members that this policy does not limit free speech and criticism of policies or actions of the Israeli government, military, or other state organisations, especially in regards to its treatment of the Palestinian people. For this, it draws on the clarifications issued by the United Kingdom Home Affairs Select Committee, in clauses 3.3 and 3.4.

1.6 It is important to recognise that this policy provides a working definition of antisemitism, and members are encouraged to develop on and amend this policy in order to improve its effectiveness.

1.7 In recognition that this policy provides only a working definition, this policy should be considered a guideline and not an exhaustive definition of antisemitism. Context and evidence should be considered during any application of this policy. 

1.8 This policy follows the Macpherson principle: that a racist incident is one perceived to be racist by the victim. Therefore, the perceptions of Jewish people, both as a collective and individually, should be the starting point for any application of this policy. Antisemitism still has to be proven by the criteria provided by this policy, but any accusations should be taken seriously and properly handled and investigated.

2. Scope

2.1 This policy on antisemitism applies to all members of the party, irrespective of any voluntary or professional position they may hold. It is supplementary to the Green Party Members Code of Conduct. It governs members’ behaviour with regard to respect for other members and the effect it has on the effective functioning of the Green Party. It may apply to behaviour towards people outside the party if it is thought to impact on the reputation or effective functioning of the party. It also governs the behaviour of members representing the party externally. 

2.2 As an addition to the Green Party Policy on Code of Conduct, this policy applies to any kind of communication covered in that document and may apply further, for example to the conduct of Green Party spokespeople.

2.3 This policy should be referred to during disputes and disciplinary procedures for complaints relating to antisemitism. 

3. Definition

3.1 Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.

3.2 Manifestations of anti-semitism might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for “why things go wrong.” It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.

3.3 It is not antisemitic to criticise the Government of Israel, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent.

3.4 It is not antisemitic to hold the Israeli Government to the same standards as other liberal democracies or to take a particular interest in the Israeli Government’s policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent.

4. Examples

4.1 The examples in this section apply only when they do not conflict with the definition of antisemitism outlined in section 3, particularly the clauses which specify what should not be considered antisemitic. They are provided for illustrative purposes to guide members and relevant committees and are not definitive. Section 3 remains the primary definition of antisemitism in this policy. Particular attention should be focused on where examples refer to criticism of a state of Israel, rather than the state of Israel. 

4.1 Contemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere could, taking into account the overall context, include, but are not limited to:

4.2 Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.

4.3 Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.

4.4 Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.

4.5 Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).

4.6 Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.

4.7 Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.

4.8 Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour.

4.9 Applying double standards by requiring of it a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.

4.10 Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.

4.11 Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.

4.12 Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.

5. Amending this policy

5.1 This policy is overseen by Green Party Regional Council and can only be amended by a motion to conference in section D of the agenda, passed by a simple majority, or by majority vote of the Green Party Regional Council in consultation with relevant committees and stakeholders, which may include Disputes Resolution Committee, Disciplinary Committee, the Executive Committee, and relevant staff.

B) To append this policy to the Members Code of Conduct, in the same way as the Policy on Bullying, Harassment, and Discrimination, such that breaching it will be grounds for a disciplinary complaint, and that it may be considered in disciplinary investigations and decisions.

""C) To insert into the Record of Organisational Statements:

Green Party Regional Council and Green Party Executive to undertake to adopt and implement the policy on antisemitism, including any necessary training as identified during implementation, by Spring Conference 2019.

It governs members’ behaviour with regard to respect for other members and the effect it has on the effective functioning of the Green Party. It may apply to behaviour towards people outside the party if it is thought to impact on the reputation or effective functioning of the party. It also governs the behaviour of members representing the party externally. 

2.2 As an addition to the Green Party Policy on Code of Conduct, this policy applies to any kind of communication covered in that document and may apply further, for example to the conduct of Green Party spokespeople.

2.3 This policy should be referred to during disputes and disciplinary procedures for complaints relating to antisemitism. 

3. Definition

3.1 Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.

3.2 Manifestations of anti-semitism might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for “why things go wrong.” It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.

3.3 It is not antisemitic to criticise the Government of Israel, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent.

3.4 It is not antisemitic to hold the Israeli Government to the same standards as other liberal democracies or to take a particular interest in the Israeli Government’s policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent.

4. Examples

4.1 The examples in this section apply only when they do not conflict with the definition of antisemitism outlined in section 3, particularly the clauses which specify what should not be considered antisemitic. They are provided for illustrative purposes to guide members and relevant committees and are not definitive. Section 3 remains the primary definition of antisemitism in this policy. Particular attention should be focused on where examples refer to criticism of a state of Israel, rather than the state of Israel. 

4.1 Contemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere could, taking into account the overall context, include, but are not limited to:

4.2 Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.

4.3 Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.

4.4 Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.

4.5 Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).

4.6 Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.

4.7 Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.

4.8 Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour.

4.9 Applying double standards by requiring of it a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.

4.10 Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.

4.11 Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.

4.12 Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.

5. Amending this policy

5.1 This policy is overseen by Green Party Regional Council and can only be amended by a motion to conference in section D of the agenda, passed by a simple majority, or by majority vote of the Green Party Regional Council in consultation with relevant committees and stakeholders, which may include Disputes Resolution Committee, Disciplinary Committee, the Executive Committee, and relevant staff.

B) To append this policy to the Members Code of Conduct, in the same way as the Policy on Bullying, Harassment, and Discrimination, such that breaching it will be grounds for a disciplinary complaint, and that it may be considered in disciplinary investigations and decisions.

""C) To insert into the Record of Organisational Statements:

Green Party Regional Council and Green Party Executive to undertake to adopt and implement the policy on antisemitism, including any necessary training as identified during implementation, by Spring Conference 2019.

Welcome back, hope you've had a great summer.

**MPs return to Westminster this week after recess.**

Of course they've already come back once, to debate Afghanistan  after Kabul fell to the Taliban. Now MPs face a full week of lawmaking,  with the Elections Bill as the highlight.

**Another theme is Universal Credit.**

The temporary £20 uplift is set to expire on 6 October.

Wednesday is an Opposition Day, so expect Labour to use that as  an opportunity to pressure the government into performing a U-turn.

**And private members' bills return after a pandemic pause.**

Remember, only a few of the private members' bills listed below  will be debated because of time constraints, and only the ones with  government backing tend to pass. That's the case for Mark Jenkinson's  bill, which extends careers guidance to children in year 7.

### MONDAY 6 SEPTEMBER

**National Insurance Contributions Bill - report stage and 3rd reading**  
Introduces tax relief for employers taking on employees in a  freeport, or hiring veterans who have left the armed forces within the  last year.

### TUESDAY 7 SEPTEMBER

Many business owners had argued this because it can  lower their building's assumed rental value, potentially reducing  business rates in the future. Also closes a legal loophole by giving the  Insolvency Service powers to investigate the directors of dissolved  companies.

I've mentioned it a lot in the past few weeks: the current parliamentary session is expected to end in April. Now there's some speculation that ministers might be forced to drop some legislation to get the rest of it through before then.

I am writing to co-propose Nate Higgins' Late Motion entitled ""Antisemitism Policy"". The text of this motion can be found below

Antisemitism Policy

Motion Synopsis

The need for a formal definition of antisemitism as part of our code of conduct, in order to combat the rising antisemitic sentiment in society and our political discourse, has become significant. This motion adds a formal definition of antisemitism to our members code of conduct.

Motion Text

Conference notes and is deeply concerned by current and rising levels of antisemitism in our society. Conference also notes the party’s responsibility to combat antisemitism and to take a strong stance against it. 

Conference also notes that the Green Party Executive has been deliberating whether to adopt a formal definition of antisemitism. In a statement on the 13th of August 2018, it was announced that the executive had decided not to adopt a formal definition at this time, saying “One argument was that such a significant decision ought to be taken by the wider membership and in close partnership with our Jewish members in particular”. 

Therefore conference resolves:

A) To create an antisemitism policy which can be amended by a motion to conference in section D of the agenda, passed by a simple majority, or by a majority vote of the Green Party Regional Council in consultation with relevant committees and stakeholders. Insert into it:

1. About the policy

1.1 There is often a lot of debate about what is and is not considered antisemitism, both within and external to the Green Party, and it is the purpose of this policy to provide a clear set of guidelines for members to follow in order to avoid perpetuating antisemitism and its associated tropes.

1.2 Unlike with some other kinds of discrimination, within the party there is not currently a widely understood and agreed idea of what constitutes antisemitism and what does not, and this policy addresses that.

1.3 When discussing complex issues such as the conflict between Israel and Palestine, it is helpful for members to have a reference to help them to ensure they are not unwittingly perpetuating antisemitism or inadvertently using language commonly associated with antisemitic tropes, which this policy provides. 

1.4 This policy draws on the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, and its associated examples, to provide a clear, internationally and domestically recognised definition of antisemitism to guide members.

1.5 This policy seeks to ensure that it is understood by members that this policy does not limit free speech and criticism of policies or actions of the Israeli government, military, or other state organisations, especially in regards to its treatment of the Palestinian people. For this, it draws on the clarifications issued by the United Kingdom Home Affairs Select Committee, in clauses 3.3 and 3.4.

1.6 It is important to recognise that this policy provides a working definition of antisemitism, and members are encouraged to develop on and amend this policy in order to improve its effectiveness.

1.7 In recognition that this policy provides only a working definition, this policy should be considered a guideline and not an exhaustive definition of antisemitism. Context and evidence should be considered during any application of this policy. 

1.8 This policy follows the Macpherson principle: that a racist incident is one perceived to be racist by the victim. Therefore, the perceptions of Jewish people, both as a collective and individually, should be the starting point for any application of this policy. Antisemitism still has to be proven by the criteria provided by this policy, but any accusations should be taken seriously and properly handled and investigated.

2. Scope

2.1 This policy on antisemitism applies to all members of the party, irrespective of any voluntary or professional position they may hold. It is supplementary to the Green Party Members Code of Conduct. It governs members’ behaviour with regard to respect for other members and the effect it has on the effective functioning of the Green Party. It may apply to behaviour towards people outside the party if it is thought to impact on the reputation or effective functioning of the party. It also governs the behaviour of members representing the party externally. 

2.2 As an addition to the Green Party Policy on Code of Conduct, this policy applies to any kind of communication covered in that document and may apply further, for example to the conduct of Green Party spokespeople.

2.3 This policy should be referred to during disputes and disciplinary procedures for complaints relating to antisemitism. 

3. Definition

3.1 Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.

3.2 Manifestations of anti-semitism might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for “why things go wrong.” It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.

3.3 It is not antisemitic to criticise the Government of Israel, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent.

3.4 It is not antisemitic to hold the Israeli Government to the same standards as other liberal democracies or to take a particular interest in the Israeli Government’s policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent.

4. Examples

4.1 The examples in this section apply only when they do not conflict with the definition of antisemitism outlined in section 3, particularly the clauses which specify what should not be considered antisemitic. They are provided for illustrative purposes to guide members and relevant committees and are not definitive. Section 3 remains the primary definition of antisemitism in this policy. Particular attention should be focused on where examples refer to criticism of a state of Israel, rather than the state of Israel. 

4.1 Contemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere could, taking into account the overall context, include, but are not limited to:

4.2 Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.

4.3 Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.

4.4 Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.

4.5 Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).

4.6 Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.

4.7 Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.

4.8 Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour.

4.9 Applying double standards by requiring of it a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.

4.10 Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.

4.11 Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.

4.12 Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.

5. Amending this policy

5.1 This policy is overseen by Green Party Regional Council and can only be amended by a motion to conference in section D of the agenda, passed by a simple majority, or by majority vote of the Green Party Regional Council in consultation with relevant committees and stakeholders, which may include Disputes Resolution Committee, Disciplinary Committee, the Executive Committee, and relevant staff.

B) To append this policy to the Members Code of Conduct, in the same way as the Policy on Bullying, Harassment, and Discrimination, such that breaching it will be grounds for a disciplinary complaint, and that it may be considered in disciplinary investigations and decisions.

""C) To insert into the Record of Organisational Statements:

Green Party Regional Council and Green Party Executive to undertake to adopt and implement the policy on antisemitism, including any necessary training as identified during implementation, by Spring Conference 2019.

Obviously he has campaigned against Muslims for years, but there are thousands of Christians in Gaza being bombed as well.

Not only that but what about all the assassinations and letter bombings carried out by Jewish terrorists who went on to form the IDF?

Hundreds of British people were killed by them so why is the right wing taking their side? Or is it just brown = bad.

This isn’t supposed to be a debate on if Britain or Hamas was right or wrong btw just on why the right wing is backing Israel. 

There’s no logic to taking the side of the people that were bombing London. Jewish terrorists were killing British people while Britain was fighting the nazi’s…

RightWingUK,comment,Israel,k8ndky0,LordSevolox,,"The debate isn’t really Palestine vs Isreal like people make it out to be, very very few people have issues with Palestine existing - but Hamas runs Gaza and is the one who instigated all of this. They attacked Isreal.

Israel’s response hasn’t been amazing, we can all see that, but there has been atrocities done by both sides and it’s stupid to ignore what Hamas (actual terrorists) are doing. Many of the protests on the streets have been pro-Hamas and/or anti-Jewish.

Robinson and others aren’t necessarily anti-Palestine or “brown = bad”, but they’re against Hamas and against anti-semitism. They support Israel’s right to defend themselves against terrorists (although they have done some bad things in the process of protecting themselves).

Both sides have posted disinformation campaigns so it’s hard to know what’s actually going on, but it has proven a that a lot of the things Isreal is said to have done isn’t true. For example, there was a video posted of Isreal blowing up a housing block without warning, but that video didn’t show the warnings Isreal gave those inside the building 15 minutes prior, as is their normal procedure. The building was demolished because of its use by Hamas.

If you want to have a further discussion about the situation I’d be happy to have one as long as it remains civil, but it’s pretty common for those on the left to get quite toxic on this sub so hopefully you won’t be.",2023-11-10T14:27:14+00:00

RightWingUK,comment,Israel,k8ng0nf,Unhappy-Landscape-37,,"We all know Hamas is in the wrong, nobody is debating that. Pro Palestinian protests aren’t defending them.

Just asking why the right wing is defending Israel despite all the British lives lost to them, even the royal British legion is in favour of the pro Palestinian protests.

Being against Palestinian protests is against what the royal British legion and armistice day stands for. So by siding Isreal it’s literally being anti British. 

If they are for people to defend themselves what about the almost 500 Palestinians shot during protests in which an independent inquiry found only 2 were possibly justified the rest were war crimes?

Or about the 6k Palestinians killed in the last 15 years before October 7th.

Many Jewish people are against the settlers and the settlers are allowed to openly kill Palestinians with no repercussions so why don’t they have a right to defend themselves?

https://www.yesh-din.org/en/data-sheet-december-2022-law-enforcement-on-israeli-civilians-in-the-west-bank-settler-violence-2005-2022/

So it clearly isn’t about defending people from terrorists because the IDF was formed from terrorist organisations which killed British people.

It’s not about people defending themselves either since they are against Palestinians defending themselves.

If anything tommy and friends are being pro terrorist and anti British.",2023-11-10T14:44:06+00:00

RightWingUK,comment,Israel,k8nk0he,LordSevolox,,"I think you’re coming with an already pre set view of things instead of trying to look at this openly.

Yes, Isreal has done some horrendous things, nobody is denying that. No one has issues with pro-Palestine protests either. The thing people have issues with is the pro-Hamas parts of the protests (which exist, along with anti-semitism) and the way some the protests are being done. It’s fine to want to protest as you think your country is under threat (little good it will do), that is and should be their right - but that doesn’t mean they should desecrate British monuments in the process (including the planned disruption on Nov 11)

Many also have issue with the way the police have been one sided in this situation. Pro-Palestine supporters are allowed to disrupt the peace all the want but those who are against them aren’t allowed to do the same, even when doing literally nothing more then holding the Union flag or the flag of Isreal, both are seen as “inciting violence” by the police. In fact, they’re right in some regard, as many Jews and pro-Isreal supporters have been assaulted over the recent weeks. 

We also shouldn’t ignore the death of British lives caused by Hamas, which is also in the hundreds.

I’ll say it again: People who are pro-Isreal aren’t anti-Palestine, they’re anti-Hamas. Most support a two-state solution. Obviously there’s some who don’t fit that, I can’t speak for everyone, but I guarantee a much larger amount of pro-Palestinian supporters support a one state solution, as is the goal of Hamas. Isreal (at least on average, changes do exist between governments) has been very pro-two state but Palestinians and Hamas have been very against it as a whole, it’s why there’s been no peace - everytime it goes to the table Isreal goes “Yup, fine by me” but Palestine denies it, wanting the entire region. Just look at the history of peace negotiations and it’s the same story on repeat. 

Isreal is defending themselves, Hamas was the aggressor. There’s no denying that, it’s a fact. The actions they’ve taken have gone further than defending themselves, and we can condemn the government of Isreal, but in the same way we should condemn the government of Gaza (*Hamas*). Both citizens of Isreal and Palestine are victims, but only one gets cared about. What the right is doing is supporting the people of Isreal against Hamas, but not the hostile actions of Isreal against civilians. 

The settler thing is a whole different issue with its own can of worms and I can go into that if you want but that’s not what’s being discussed.",2023-11-10T15:11:20+00:00

This war isn’t a British issue, it’s a Palestinian and Israeli issue, seeing innocent people die on either side is unfortunate, but it’s none of our business as a nation, these people have been fighting each other for centuries and as demonstrated by several western military intervention’s in the past few decades, were just too different to understand there way of life, that’s why multiculturalism is such a bad idea in the first place because it mixes cultures and religions that shouldn’t be mixed, it’s like water and oil, they don’t mix to form something new, they naturally contradict each other and remain separate.",2024-04-08T01:42:33+00:00

>Today Sam Melia was found guilty of speech crimes in Leeds Crown Court. Sam produced over 300 stickers bearing a number of slogans, during the opening stages of the trial the prosecution admitted that the language used on the stickers was in fact lawful. During the trial the jury was told that it did not matter whether the content of the stickers was true, as the truth is no defence in such a case. This has to be one of the greatest miscarriages of justice we have ever witnessed, a body of work which was deemed 'lawful' and the content of which was all true, has resulted in a man being found guilty on the basis of his perceived motivations.

>Sam will be sentenced on March 1st and it is likely he will face a custodial sentence measured in years. Before that happens, it would be great to raise a small sum in order for Sam to take his family away for a week to allow them to have a break from what has been, and continues to be, a nightmare that has lasted yeas.

I will respect our rights and freedoms. I will uphold our democratic values. I will observe our laws faithfully and fulfil my duties as a British citizen, for Queen and Country. So help me God.” The home nations can also have their own respective pledge of allegiances, for example in Texas were pupils pledge allegiance to the US and to the state of Texas

RightWingUK,comment,Pro-Palestine,kt022se,UnnamedArchon,,"From [GiveSendGo](https://www.givesendgo.com/sammelia) page:

>Today Sam Melia was found guilty of speech crimes in Leeds Crown Court. Sam produced over 300 stickers bearing a number of slogans, during the opening stages of the trial the prosecution admitted that the language used on the stickers was in fact lawful. During the trial the jury was told that it did not matter whether the content of the stickers was true, as the truth is no defence in such a case. This has to be one of the greatest miscarriages of justice we have ever witnessed, a body of work which was deemed 'lawful' and the content of which was all true, has resulted in a man being found guilty on the basis of his perceived motivations. 

>Sam is a husband to a Laura, a father to Catherine and has another baby on the way in just 12 weeks. Sam is a hard working man with a big heart who has always gone out his way to help others and support those around him who were in need of help. Now Sam needs your help.

>Sam will be sentenced on March 1st and it is likely he will face a custodial sentence measured in years. Before that happens, it would be great to raise a small sum in order for Sam to take his family away for a week to allow them to have a break from what has been, and continues to be, a nightmare that has lasted yeas.

RightWingUK,post,Pro-Israel,17s0v2p,Unhappy-Landscape-37,Why is Tommy Robinson and the right wing backing Isreal?,"Genuine question I’m interested in responses from right wing people because I don’t know any.

Obviously he has campaigned against Muslims for years, but there are thousands of Christians in Gaza being bombed as well.

Not only that but what about all the assassinations and letter bombings carried out by Jewish terrorists who went on to form the IDF?

Hundreds of British people were killed by them so why is the right wing taking their side? Or is it just brown = bad.

This isn’t supposed to be a debate on if Britain or Hamas was right or wrong btw just on why the right wing is backing Israel. 

There’s no logic to taking the side of the people that were bombing London. Jewish terrorists were killing British people while Britain was fighting the nazi’s… 

Im not saying they should be pro Palestinian either just why get involved?",2023-11-10T10:05:00+00:00

RightWingUK,comment,Pro-Israel,k8ndky0,LordSevolox,,"The debate isn’t really Palestine vs Isreal like people make it out to be, very very few people have issues with Palestine existing - but Hamas runs Gaza and is the one who instigated all of this. They attacked Isreal.

Israel’s response hasn’t been amazing, we can all see that, but there has been atrocities done by both sides and it’s stupid to ignore what Hamas (actual terrorists) are doing. Many of the protests on the streets have been pro-Hamas and/or anti-Jewish.

Robinson and others aren’t necessarily anti-Palestine or “brown = bad”, but they’re against Hamas and against anti-semitism. They support Israel’s right to defend themselves against terrorists (although they have done some bad things in the process of protecting themselves).

Both sides have posted disinformation campaigns so it’s hard to know what’s actually going on, but it has proven a that a lot of the things Isreal is said to have done isn’t true. For example, there was a video posted of Isreal blowing up a housing block without warning, but that video didn’t show the warnings Isreal gave those inside the building 15 minutes prior, as is their normal procedure. The building was demolished because of its use by Hamas.

If you want to have a further discussion about the situation I’d be happy to have one as long as it remains civil, but it’s pretty common for those on the left to get quite toxic on this sub so hopefully you won’t be.",2023-11-10T14:27:14+00:00

Just asking why the right wing is defending Israel despite all the British lives lost to them, even the royal British legion is in favour of the pro Palestinian protests.

Being against Palestinian protests is against what the royal British legion and armistice day stands for. So by siding Isreal it’s literally being anti British. 

If they are for people to defend themselves what about the almost 500 Palestinians shot during protests in which an independent inquiry found only 2 were possibly justified the rest were war crimes?

Or about the 6k Palestinians killed in the last 15 years before October 7th.

Many Jewish people are against the settlers and the settlers are allowed to openly kill Palestinians with no repercussions so why don’t they have a right to defend themselves?

RightWingUK,comment,Pro-Israel,k8nk0he,LordSevolox,,"I think you’re coming with an already pre set view of things instead of trying to look at this openly.

Yes, Isreal has done some horrendous things, nobody is denying that. No one has issues with pro-Palestine protests either. The thing people have issues with is the pro-Hamas parts of the protests (which exist, along with anti-semitism) and the way some the protests are being done. It’s fine to want to protest as you think your country is under threat (little good it will do), that is and should be their right - but that doesn’t mean they should desecrate British monuments in the process (including the planned disruption on Nov 11)

Many also have issue with the way the police have been one sided in this situation. Pro-Palestine supporters are allowed to disrupt the peace all the want but those who are against them aren’t allowed to do the same, even when doing literally nothing more then holding the Union flag or the flag of Isreal, both are seen as “inciting violence” by the police. In fact, they’re right in some regard, as many Jews and pro-Isreal supporters have been assaulted over the recent weeks. 

We also shouldn’t ignore the death of British lives caused by Hamas, which is also in the hundreds.

I’ll say it again: People who are pro-Isreal aren’t anti-Palestine, they’re anti-Hamas. Most support a two-state solution. Obviously there’s some who don’t fit that, I can’t speak for everyone, but I guarantee a much larger amount of pro-Palestinian supporters support a one state solution, as is the goal of Hamas. Isreal (at least on average, changes do exist between governments) has been very pro-two state but Palestinians and Hamas have been very against it as a whole, it’s why there’s been no peace - everytime it goes to the table Isreal goes “Yup, fine by me” but Palestine denies it, wanting the entire region. Just look at the history of peace negotiations and it’s the same story on repeat. 

Isreal is defending themselves, Hamas was the aggressor. There’s no denying that, it’s a fact. The actions they’ve taken have gone further than defending themselves, and we can condemn the government of Isreal, but in the same way we should condemn the government of Gaza (*Hamas*). Both citizens of Isreal and Palestine are victims, but only one gets cared about. What the right is doing is supporting the people of Isreal against Hamas, but not the hostile actions of Isreal against civilians.

* Replace VAT with a Local Sales Tax, set by the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties with freedom to vary the rate according to their spending needs

* Lower income and corporation taxes by 5% to allow subnational bodies to have their own local rates

* Decentralise the UK economy by moving civil service jobs out of London and encourage and set up new financial districts in Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Glasgow to with the goal for these cities to rival London

* Rename the Bank of England to the Bank of the United Kingdom (Bank UK)

* Replace English, Scottish, Northern Irish and UK territorial banknotes with a single UK currency banknote like we have with coins with its introduction set after the death of Queen Elizabeth II

* Reintroduce the £1 note into circulation

**Foreign Affairs and Defence**

* Support the existence of the Commonwealth of Nations, and will work for closer ties with the member states of the Commonwealth, while also being open to any application from countries who share the values of the Commonwealth for membership

* Work with international community to have a two-state solution to the Israel/Palestine and support Israel’s right to exist while refusing recognition of the Palestine state until they are fully democratic and committed to peaceful ways to resolving the conflict

* Recognise the Republic of Somaliland as a sovereign state and encourage the international community support its recognition

* Commit to spend 2% GDP on defence and increase annually by 0.5% provided GDP continues to rise

* Withdrawal from European Court of Human Rights

* Open internment camps in British Overseas Territories including a camp in the British Antarctic Territory for extraordinarily dangerous people operated by the military

* Seperate the Specialist Operations directorate from the London Metropolitan Police Service to its own agency H.M Specialist Operations (H.M.S.O) with responsibility for the protection of the Houses of Parliament, Downing Street, Whitehall, Buckingham Palace, the senior members of the British Royal Family, members of The Cabinet, other ministerial members of Her Majesty's Government and the Parliaments and administrations of the Home Nations, while moving responsibility of co-ordinating and leading on UK-wide national counter-terrorism matters to the National Crime Agency allowing the Met to focus on general policing in the Greater London region

* Give the citizens of Gibraltar and the Crown dependencies a referendum on becoming fully British, and having representation in the Houses of Parliament including their own MPs in the lower house and representation in the upper house

**International Trade**

* Support and negotiate the purposed CANZUK Group consisting of the Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom which sees cooperation between the four nations on free trade, foreign policy, constitutional affairs and freedom of movement

* Join EFTA, allowing us access to the four freedoms of the EU while allowing us the freedom to seek other trade deals with foreign countries, put in place restrictions on freedom of movement and if possible seek to negotiate further restrictions such as proof of proficiency in the English language

* Seek to join NAFTA, allowing us access to Canadian, American, Mexican markets once its future is secure and the CPTPP trade agreement, a signed, but not-yet ratified, trade agreement between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam giving us access to their markets once ratified

* Support and negotiate the creation of the Commonwealth Free Trade Association, which will massively boost trade between Commonwealth nations

* Recommission the Royal Yacht Britannia used to sign new trade deals and privately funded via donations at no tax payers expense

**Health**

* Set up a commission to look into reforming the NHS into a social insurance model of universal healthcare for citizens which subsidises most healthcare costs as opposed to an outdated health service with different NHS plans available for citizens as well as specific plans for children, students, the disabled and the retired

* Introduce a flat NHS levy of 2% of income for additional funding of the NHS with opt outs available for individuals who use private insurance

* Encourage strong competition in free market healthcare to drive up standards and encourage more Britons to opt for private health insurance

* No NHS funding for abortions unless a victim of rape, the baby is life threatening to the mother or foetal abnormalities. Illegal after 24 weeks unless life threatening, or foetal abnormalities occur

* Allow foreign nationals with legal rights to work in the UK to have full access to NHS treatment provided they pay the 2% NHS levy

**Education**

* Introduce a Tuition Fee Equality bill to have UK universities charge all UK students the same rate for tuition fees as a resident of any other EU country, regardless of which part of the UK they are from

* Replace tuition fees with a flat graduate tax. This will be done by setting up a 'Higher Education Agency' which will fund higher education in England in which all UK graduates who graduated from English universities earning above £25,000 would pay into through a flat 5% levy on their annual income and also donations of other bodies. Seek to link this agency to its Scottish counterpart SAAS and Welsh and Northern Irish counterparts to make fee collecting easier for students who study in other parts of the UK

Obviously he has campaigned against Muslims for years, but there are thousands of Christians in Gaza being bombed as well.

Not only that but what about all the assassinations and letter bombings carried out by Jewish terrorists who went on to form the IDF?

Hundreds of British people were killed by them so why is the right wing taking their side? Or is it just brown = bad.

This isn’t supposed to be a debate on if Britain or Hamas was right or wrong btw just on why the right wing is backing Israel. 

There’s no logic to taking the side of the people that were bombing London. Jewish terrorists were killing British people while Britain was fighting the nazi’s…

RightWingUK,comment,Hamas,k8ndky0,LordSevolox,,"The debate isn’t really Palestine vs Isreal like people make it out to be, very very few people have issues with Palestine existing - but Hamas runs Gaza and is the one who instigated all of this. They attacked Isreal.

Israel’s response hasn’t been amazing, we can all see that, but there has been atrocities done by both sides and it’s stupid to ignore what Hamas (actual terrorists) are doing. Many of the protests on the streets have been pro-Hamas and/or anti-Jewish.

Robinson and others aren’t necessarily anti-Palestine or “brown = bad”, but they’re against Hamas and against anti-semitism. They support Israel’s right to defend themselves against terrorists (although they have done some bad things in the process of protecting themselves).

Both sides have posted disinformation campaigns so it’s hard to know what’s actually going on, but it has proven a that a lot of the things Isreal is said to have done isn’t true. For example, there was a video posted of Isreal blowing up a housing block without warning, but that video didn’t show the warnings Isreal gave those inside the building 15 minutes prior, as is their normal procedure. The building was demolished because of its use by Hamas.

If you want to have a further discussion about the situation I’d be happy to have one as long as it remains civil, but it’s pretty common for those on the left to get quite toxic on this sub so hopefully you won’t be.",2023-11-10T14:27:14+00:00

Just asking why the right wing is defending Israel despite all the British lives lost to them, even the royal British legion is in favour of the pro Palestinian protests.

Being against Palestinian protests is against what the royal British legion and armistice day stands for. So by siding Isreal it’s literally being anti British. 

If they are for people to defend themselves what about the almost 500 Palestinians shot during protests in which an independent inquiry found only 2 were possibly justified the rest were war crimes?

Or about the 6k Palestinians killed in the last 15 years before October 7th.

Many Jewish people are against the settlers and the settlers are allowed to openly kill Palestinians with no repercussions so why don’t they have a right to defend themselves?

https://www.yesh-din.org/en/data-sheet-december-2022-law-enforcement-on-israeli-civilians-in-the-west-bank-settler-violence-2005-2022/

RightWingUK,comment,Hamas,k8nk0he,LordSevolox,,"I think you’re coming with an already pre set view of things instead of trying to look at this openly.

Yes, Isreal has done some horrendous things, nobody is denying that. No one has issues with pro-Palestine protests either. The thing people have issues with is the pro-Hamas parts of the protests (which exist, along with anti-semitism) and the way some the protests are being done. It’s fine to want to protest as you think your country is under threat (little good it will do), that is and should be their right - but that doesn’t mean they should desecrate British monuments in the process (including the planned disruption on Nov 11)

Many also have issue with the way the police have been one sided in this situation. Pro-Palestine supporters are allowed to disrupt the peace all the want but those who are against them aren’t allowed to do the same, even when doing literally nothing more then holding the Union flag or the flag of Isreal, both are seen as “inciting violence” by the police. In fact, they’re right in some regard, as many Jews and pro-Isreal supporters have been assaulted over the recent weeks. 

We also shouldn’t ignore the death of British lives caused by Hamas, which is also in the hundreds.

I’ll say it again: People who are pro-Isreal aren’t anti-Palestine, they’re anti-Hamas. Most support a two-state solution. Obviously there’s some who don’t fit that, I can’t speak for everyone, but I guarantee a much larger amount of pro-Palestinian supporters support a one state solution, as is the goal of Hamas. Isreal (at least on average, changes do exist between governments) has been very pro-two state but Palestinians and Hamas have been very against it as a whole, it’s why there’s been no peace - everytime it goes to the table Isreal goes “Yup, fine by me” but Palestine denies it, wanting the entire region. Just look at the history of peace negotiations and it’s the same story on repeat. 

Isreal is defending themselves, Hamas was the aggressor. There’s no denying that, it’s a fact. The actions they’ve taken have gone further than defending themselves, and we can condemn the government of Isreal, but in the same way we should condemn the government of Gaza (*Hamas*). Both citizens of Isreal and Palestine are victims, but only one gets cared about. What the right is doing is supporting the people of Isreal against Hamas, but not the hostile actions of Isreal against civilians. 

The settler thing is a whole different issue with its own can of worms and I can go into that if you want but that’s not what’s being discussed.",2023-11-10T15:11:20+00:00

RightWingUK,comment,Hamas,kzcb63w,Doumekitsu,,"I was banned from offmychest subreddit a few days back, just because I interacted with some red-pill subreddit (and also, some of the subreddits that the mods didn't like lol). I was like why take it personally when a person hasn't commented anything (like ever). I was surprised and started checking out the mods' profile. Guess what, most of them are wokies and far left circle jerks who try to tell people what to do and sell some unrealistic expectations (including ""no don't lose weight"" or ""transition if you feel like it"" even if they are not in the position of commenting on things like that).

I am just sick of this part of reddit. The other day, a woman tried to fight me in a thread about HSV saying that I am talking for all the people out there, which I didn't. I just said that I won't date a guy with HSV (as some  guy posted that he has it and wanted to know if anyone would date him irl knowing that he has it). All of the women were just being fake nice to him and they seemed like they didn't want to tell him the real aspect of it/ help him with some good advice like how to cope if he gets rejected. They were just blabbering like how they never discriminate etc.,  and I told him to take all that with a grain of salt and have realistic expectations and the women got mad. It's like they don't wanna even listen to what people got to say. and I could tell most of them would dump the guy long-term.

Obviously he has campaigned against Muslims for years, but there are thousands of Christians in Gaza being bombed as well.

Not only that but what about all the assassinations and letter bombings carried out by Jewish terrorists who went on to form the IDF?

Hundreds of British people were killed by them so why is the right wing taking their side? Or is it just brown = bad.

This isn’t supposed to be a debate on if Britain or Hamas was right or wrong btw just on why the right wing is backing Israel. 

There’s no logic to taking the side of the people that were bombing London. Jewish terrorists were killing British people while Britain was fighting the nazi’s…

Israel’s response hasn’t been amazing, we can all see that, but there has been atrocities done by both sides and it’s stupid to ignore what Hamas (actual terrorists) are doing. Many of the protests on the streets have been pro-Hamas and/or anti-Jewish.

Robinson and others aren’t necessarily anti-Palestine or “brown = bad”, but they’re against Hamas and against anti-semitism. They support Israel’s right to defend themselves against terrorists (although they have done some bad things in the process of protecting themselves).

Both sides have posted disinformation campaigns so it’s hard to know what’s actually going on, but it has proven a that a lot of the things Isreal is said to have done isn’t true. For example, there was a video posted of Isreal blowing up a housing block without warning, but that video didn’t show the warnings Isreal gave those inside the building 15 minutes prior, as is their normal procedure. The building was demolished because of its use by Hamas.

Just asking why the right wing is defending Israel despite all the British lives lost to them, even the royal British legion is in favour of the pro Palestinian protests.

Being against Palestinian protests is against what the royal British legion and armistice day stands for. So by siding Isreal it’s literally being anti British. 

If they are for people to defend themselves what about the almost 500 Palestinians shot during protests in which an independent inquiry found only 2 were possibly justified the rest were war crimes?

Or about the 6k Palestinians killed in the last 15 years before October 7th.

Many Jewish people are against the settlers and the settlers are allowed to openly kill Palestinians with no repercussions so why don’t they have a right to defend themselves?

RightWingUK,comment,IDF,k8nk0he,LordSevolox,,"I think you’re coming with an already pre set view of things instead of trying to look at this openly.

Yes, Isreal has done some horrendous things, nobody is denying that. No one has issues with pro-Palestine protests either. The thing people have issues with is the pro-Hamas parts of the protests (which exist, along with anti-semitism) and the way some the protests are being done. It’s fine to want to protest as you think your country is under threat (little good it will do), that is and should be their right - but that doesn’t mean they should desecrate British monuments in the process (including the planned disruption on Nov 11)

Many also have issue with the way the police have been one sided in this situation. Pro-Palestine supporters are allowed to disrupt the peace all the want but those who are against them aren’t allowed to do the same, even when doing literally nothing more then holding the Union flag or the flag of Isreal, both are seen as “inciting violence” by the police. In fact, they’re right in some regard, as many Jews and pro-Isreal supporters have been assaulted over the recent weeks. 

We also shouldn’t ignore the death of British lives caused by Hamas, which is also in the hundreds.

I’ll say it again: People who are pro-Isreal aren’t anti-Palestine, they’re anti-Hamas. Most support a two-state solution. Obviously there’s some who don’t fit that, I can’t speak for everyone, but I guarantee a much larger amount of pro-Palestinian supporters support a one state solution, as is the goal of Hamas. Isreal (at least on average, changes do exist between governments) has been very pro-two state but Palestinians and Hamas have been very against it as a whole, it’s why there’s been no peace - everytime it goes to the table Isreal goes “Yup, fine by me” but Palestine denies it, wanting the entire region. Just look at the history of peace negotiations and it’s the same story on repeat. 

Isreal is defending themselves, Hamas was the aggressor. There’s no denying that, it’s a fact. The actions they’ve taken have gone further than defending themselves, and we can condemn the government of Isreal, but in the same way we should condemn the government of Gaza (*Hamas*). Both citizens of Isreal and Palestine are victims, but only one gets cared about. What the right is doing is supporting the people of Isreal against Hamas, but not the hostile actions of Isreal against civilians.

tories,post,Israel-Palestine,1b3whb6,nomad_Henry,"As an immigrant been living in the UK for the last 18 years, what do I think of the mass immigration in the UK","I come from an East Asian background and came to the UK for A-level at age 17. It has been 18 years living in this country. I started my own business, and have a family and a kid. So in my ways, I embody the British Dream for immigrants. I think the immigration system is mismanaged and here is my own perspective having gone through the system for almost 2 decades:

1, Mass immigration is the most profitable industry in the UK. International students pay more than £20K per year to study in the UK, with exorbitant housing costs on top. Immigration is a merry-go-round money-making scheme now, gov is raking in billions from visas and tuition fees, and immigration lawyers are making banks (I paid £3000 to an immigration lawyer to help my wife with her spouse visa paperwork). Big businesses can fill in roles at much lower costs. Immigrants usually work a lot harder and are more driven than local Brits, we are all here for economic opportunities, which is why u never hear people from overseas go to live in Swansea. 

2, Integration for immigrants is a joke in the UK. To be able to speak English properly is not a requirement to become a naturalised citizen in the UK, gov does not look at your level of integration, whether you are suited to the local community, or whether you are making a positive contribution to British society. The whole citizenship application process is a box-ticking exercise. I qualify as UK citizen based on the fact I have lived in the UK for 10 years as per the private life provision in the European Human Rights Convention. I have met many fellow immigrants, many of them don't speak much English nor do they have an interest in integrating. I think UK gov could have provided more incentives to immigrants to learn English and participate in the community. But I guess there is no budget to hire more immigration officers to look at citizenship applications more thoroughly.

3, Extremism is a huge issue with mass migration. Since UK has left EU, the number of migrants from EU has dropped significantly, now most growth in the immigrants come from Nigeria, Pakistan, India and Afghanistan. They have completely different values to the UK and the public naively believes these immigrants all want to be like mainstream Brits, or their kids grow up in the UK will assimilate. I personally believe one day there is going to be a rude awakening in this country about how divided people are. Just look at the recent saga with the Israel and Palestine conflict, it has become a big issue impacting Western politics. This division will get much worse in the future.

4, Political correctness regarding race is also another big issue. It is almost a taboo subject in the UK. It is an extremely racist opinion stating that immigrants from Europe will be a better fit for the UK society than African ones. Maintaining the racial makeup of the UK is crucial for social cohesion. However, we are not even allowed to discuss this issue, which I believe is detrimental to the UK in the long term.

5, the Immigration system in the UK is too complex and bounded by many antiquated international treaties from 70 years ago. Getting anything changed will be extremely difficult. The principles of UK immigration system is based on the European Convention of Human Rights. Many crucial international treaties UK with Europe is also based on ECHR like the Good Friday agreement. 

Immigration is an issue that is too complex. I doubt that the upcoming Labour government will be able to do much about it either. The realization will dawn on many people. If mass migration stops, both the housing market and the economy could face severe downturns. I don't even believe immigration is the main issue facing this country; rather, it's the low growth and lack of economic competitiveness across almost every sector. Simply stopping people from coming into the country will not address these issues, but immigration makes for effective politics.",2024-03-01T15:07:01+00:00
tories,comment,Israel-Palestine,ksz9hby,AMightyDwarf,,"Many things to pick apart here, I’ll give it a go. 

1. We will never be told a true cost/benefit analysis for immigration so saying it’s profitable or not is impossible, never mind saying that it’s the most profitable industry. What we see is that in the era of mass migration that GDP has marginally increased but GDP per capita has flatlined and that’s the one I’m bothered about because it’s a measure of my money. Big businesses having access to cheaper labour is a bad thing because it hurts workers rights and ability to argue pay. You may be here for economic reasons but I’m here because it’s my home. Also FYI Swansea is around 35% people from recent immigrant background, they do want to go there. 

2. I agree that integration is a joke. I’ve lived in an area where council documents were sent out as standard in multiple languages because people refuse to even do the minimum. I’ve been in hospitals where it’s signposted up in multiple languages. That should not happen. I no longer primarily identify as British because it’s a civic identity that’s been watered down so much it barely holds meaning. My primary identity is English because an ethnic identity that still just about means something. 

3. I agree that extremism is a problem brought on by mass migration the only difference is that you say there will be an awakening. The alarm clock rang when the grooming gang scandals came to light and the country stayed in bed. 

4. It’s not racist to suggest that people from western democracies will have a better time integrating to a western democracy. The racist opinion is saying that maintaining the racial makeup of a place is needed for cohesion. It’s not. What’s needed is primarily a mutual respect and understanding of each other. Too often we’ve invited in people who hate our country, hate our ideals and hate our very existence. We’ve invited people in who see the country as an economic centre and thus they act to drain it of what they can. We’ve invited people in who think the ideals of their home land and home culture is better than ours. Race, skin colour, whatever don’t come into it. 

5. We should not be streamlining immigration as we should not be looking to keep bringing people in. Our population keeps growing but our infrastructure and services are not and this is breaking the very fabric of our social contract. We’ve had 20-30 years of this experiment and it’s failed. The people are not richer they are poorer with less access to services and a country that’s not able to support itself. 

The housing market having a downturn would only hurt people who are using housing as a capital store and an investment. We need the housing market to crash to get young people in a position where they can afford to buy and then maybe start families. We need the economy to feel some hurt because then businesses might decide to invest instead of hoarding wealth for a few at the top. The world is seeing a demographic crisis and we need to insulate ourselves from that now. You don’t do that by importing masses of people but by reducing the labour demand whilst increasing output. In other words AI and automation. Necessity is the mother of invention and we will not invent the groundbreaking technology of the future without first making it necessary.",2024-03-02T08:57:07+00:00
tories,comment,Israel-Palestine,ksz6c9m,videki_man,,"Eastern European here, and I agree with almost everything you said. Although I'm not planning to stay (after we get the citizenship, we'll move back home).

I think mass immigration (at least at this unprecedented scale) will be the end of the English culture. Hell, even saying English has a racist undertone today which is absolutely mad.

Social cohesion still exists in the UK - among South Asians, among Black British, among the English - but not in the whole society. From my experience, the society is breaking up into parallel societies as we speak. The English go to pubs, go to football matches, go to historic sites. Even in towns where the English are now a minority, you won't see very diverse terraces or Asians having a pint in the pubs. We like to travel to historic sites with the family, and I'd say 95% of the visitors are English. There is a reason for that. 

It's madness that people here equal anti-immigration with racism. I work in IT, there are many fantastic people that I work with who are from other countries. But thinking that mass immigration will have no adverse impact on the local, indigenous culture is ridicoulous. Take a look at Eastern Europe. We killed our Jews and then expelled our Germans. Where is the once extremely vivid Jewish or German culture today in Eastern Europe? Nowhere, because it doesn't exist. If a nation of people disappears from a historical region for whatever reason, their culture dies with them. 

But of course, this is my opinion only. I know an overwhelming majority of the English (or Welsh, or Scottish) would not agree with me or call me downright racist.",2024-03-02T08:17:51+00:00

**Time is really tight.**

I've mentioned it a lot in the past few weeks: the current parliamentary session is expected to end in April. Now there's some speculation that ministers might be forced to drop some legislation to get the rest of it through before then.

**The chancellor's Spring Statement is around the corner.**

It's coming the week after next, at a critical time: with the impact of the Ukraine crisis, Rishi Sunak will be under pressure to offer help with rising energy costs and to boost defence spending.

**And seemingly every private members' bill under the sun is scheduled for Friday.**

As usual, only a couple will actually be heard.

### MONDAY 14 MARCH

**Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Bill - consideration of Lords amendments**  
Repeals the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, scrapping five-year Parliaments and returning to the pre-2011 process where the prime minister can call an election at any time.

**Professional Qualifications Bill - report stage and 3rd reading**  
Sets out a new system for how professional qualifications gained abroad are recognised in the UK. Allows regulators in the UK and overseas to mutually recognise qualifications, replacing the current method which comes from EU law and gives preferential treatment to European qualifications. Started in the Lords.

**Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill - report stage and 3rd reading**  
Establishes in law the sentience of vertebrate animals. Also creates an animal sentience committee to report on whether government policymaking is taking into account the fact that animals are sentient beings capable of feeling emotions and pain. Started in the Lords.

tories,comment,Pro-Palestine,k978b9x,Whoscapes,,"These exasperated headlines grate me. Not because they're particularly wrong but because, well, welcome to living in an ethnically Balkanised, ""diverse"" country!

Your screeching about racism does absolutely nothing because we're now in the realm of ethno-religious blood loyalty and so trying to make people conform to shared moral standards around what's acceptable discourse just will not happen. That is Balkanisation, it is the ending of a cohesive society with common social norms, ""the golden rule"" and fair play. It is also what late stage diversity looks like. A country where your moral standards and social norms are not universally held, where different groups do not have the same rules, where there is no consensus on anything - not even ""racism is bad"".

And it might be dangerous to say but these sorts of headlines really only work on white British people because we are the ones who have gone through the liberal cultural revolution most profoundly. White British people are the ones most affected by accusations of racism - calling ethnic minorities racist just doesn't cut the mustard, nobody really cares. If you're a minority you can get away with routinely saying disgusting things about white people, people make whole careers at universities and in the public sector out of it.

Indeed the only reason this story has traction is because it's racist comments being levelled against minorities (Sunak / Braverman). But actually reflect on what is being said and the abuse is equally if not more directed at all white people. After all what is the implication here if not an anti-white commentary that ""behaving like a white person"" or ""working with white people"" is disgusting or otherwise disreputable?

Consider if a white person said to another white person ""stop behaving like you're black"". Would people say ""hey, that's racist to say to him"" or would people say ""that's racist towards black people""?

Clearly the latter but this is the total asymmetry around racism that exists in Britain vis-a-vis the majority and minorities. You can get away with demonising the white majority - if her poster had just read e.g. ""Israel = white = oppressor"" she would not be in trouble here.",2023-11-14T11:49:39+00:00

As such whether you realise it or not what you are actually saying is that you think Israel's restraint in not responding proportionately is admirable, but you'd like to see in effect no response because you support terrorists and not those who respond to terrorism with unwarranted levels of restraint as Israel has historically done and continues to do now.",2023-10-14T16:01:17+00:00

Hamas is the government of Gaza. It has an estimated 80% support amongst the Gazan people. The Gazan people support Hamas just like the German people supported the Nazi's. That doesn't mean they are now legitimate targets, but it does mean that I don't give a shit if they die as collateral.

They chose war. They wanted war. They wanted a war with a country that provides them with food and electricity. In war, people die. Its not Israel's fault that Hamas can't protect their own people.

Israel tried that when they pulled out of the Gaza Strip in 2004 based on the very idea you're sharing now. It didn't work. Now hundreds of Israeli citizens are dead.

Hamas will attack Israel regardless of whether or not Israel had illegal settlements. They have made that quite clear. They want to destroy the Israeli state. They won't accept anything less.

>Israel could glass Gaza completely and it wouldn't stop attacks. Hamas is probably gaining members faster than Israel can kill them (and their neighbours).

You're right. They'll have to conquer the Gaza Strip and the Westbank to end the attacks from Hamas permanently. Only the death of the Palestinian State will end the genocidal threat Hamas presents.

I believe there is still hope for a Tory government. Based on this graph that I saw on X which is about: ""**Where are 2019 voters today?**"" Tory supporters on “**Don’t know**” will eventually decide voting for Tories and some of the votes from Reform Party will decide to vote for Tory in last minute. Also, many Labour voters are unhappy due to Starmer’s policies such as:

* He didn’t ask for ceasefire in Gaza
* Many Muslims think he didn't condemn Israel enough, so they're disappointed
* He supports strike on Houthis
* Some of his views are bit Centrist

So that many Labour voters will just skip this election and it means less votes for Starmer. Also Corbyn is planning to create a new Left-wing party, this would split votes in the Left which is good news.

They were always going to turn up if they thought it was under threat - which they would have thought, with or without Braverman. 

Also, it is the EDL. They get angry about Subway offering halal food. The videos we saw of people calling out “jihad” on the streets of London (which I know they claim is not a call to violence) was always going to trigger them.

Nine years ago I found myself sitting across the desk from the head of London’s Tricycle Theatre. As the Secretary of State for Culture, that would hardly have been a surprising meeting to host – but this one almost felt like a job for the Foreign Secretary.  
The theatre had just taken the extraordinary decision to cancel its hosting of the UK Jewish Film Festival. A publicly funded venue had effectively shuttered its doors to the Jewish community. The reason? Because the festival had received a contribution of £1,500 towards its running costs from the Embassy of Israel.   
This one incident was a wake-up call to the dangers posed by the Boycott, Divestments and Sanctions (BDS) movement and its pernicious obsession with the State of Israel. A once fringe movement had reached institutions funded by the British taxpayer that had nothing to do with international affairs.

tories,comment,Occupation,i8srhoj,AnyLemon0,,"> If we all suddenly switched to WFH it wouldn't just be life as normal except we work from home. 

But obviously that can't and won't happen. A theoretical maximum of 20% of UK jobs can be done from home, and some of those are only done badly and in extremis (e.g. teaching). Pre-Pandemic, ~5% of people worked from home, so we're looking at a maximum 10-15% swing in the overall workforce.

At least 80% of people are going to carry on working-at-work, whether they work in manufacturing, health, retail, logistics, hospitality, teaching, transport, etc.

Obviously for specific locations (City of London, certain out-of-town business parks - more on that later) the change would be much more profound.

I used to take lunch to work, but on occasion went and got a meal deal if I'd not had time that day. **I now spend a lot more money in my local corner shop. That's undoubtedly a good thing - more money to local business, less to Tesco/Aldi.**

> Without these central hubs the structure of towns will change and they'll lose what kind of community centre remains. This will have a knock on effect on society.

I have to say, I don't really know what sort of hub you're talking about. The last 60years has been marked by the development of car-first edge-of-town business parks. Half the time they don't even have a bus stop. Get in your car, drive to work and you're there. I did have a previous job in an office that was above the high street (of course parking was always difficult and there was no bus that went in the right direction for me!). It was lovely being able to pop into the bank at lunchtime and run errands. But then I ended up in a big box in the middle of nowhere. Sadly, an awful lot of jobs are like that - really discouraged from even leaving the building until 5pm. But it doesn't matter anyway because there's *aren't* any local businesses to patronise at lunchtime - apart from the sandwich van doing its rounds.

This idea of central hubs requires that we rebuild the walkable society we've been building car parks on top of for the past 60 years. Back in 2008 I was signed up with an employment agency trying to find something during the big crash. It seemed like every other job they had was ""do you have a car? It's on a business park"" I said ""yes"" because I was in the fortunate position that I could borrow some money off my parents if necessary to get a car to get a job.

But that's fundamentally an appalling position for our society to be in - the idea that whole tranches of jobs are basically closed to people unless they can drive and own a car, because our councils have spent decades rubber-stamping inaccessible business parks in the middle of nowhere.

What's quite interesting is that the number of 18-25s with a driving license dropped significantly from 2010-2019. Fewer people are taking their test, fewer people want to drive. Which is understandable since getting a license now costs >£1000 for most people. If workplaces want staff, they're going to have to start positioning themselves in accessible locations, or asking the council to provide better public transport. Maybe we'll see the return of some of these high streets and hubs which have been dying off for so many years.

But for everyone else, WFH is just a re-adjustment of the economy. Just as businesses moving from central town locations out to edge-of-town business parks and factories was a re-adjustment of the economy.

What we definitely need is a lot more mixed development. Acres of identikit brick boxes attached to a bypass with everyone trying to drive down the road to the business park at the other end (and then back at 5pm) needs to end. We need estates to mix residential, local retail and commercial offices/light industrial. Sure, there's always going to be a place for heavy industry out-of-town. Noone wants a refinery next to a primary school. But for everything else, it needs to get smooshed back together, walkable, with public transport options taking precedence over provision for car access.",2022-05-16T08:55:03+00:00

It was a troubled time for NI, and politicians reached out to the IRA, even those known to be active terrorists such as those two. Was that traitorous on behalf of Edward Heath's Tory government?

tories,post,Israel-Palestine Conflict/Conflict,1b3whb6,nomad_Henry,"As an immigrant been living in the UK for the last 18 years, what do I think of the mass immigration in the UK","I come from an East Asian background and came to the UK for A-level at age 17. It has been 18 years living in this country. I started my own business, and have a family and a kid. So in my ways, I embody the British Dream for immigrants. I think the immigration system is mismanaged and here is my own perspective having gone through the system for almost 2 decades:

1, Mass immigration is the most profitable industry in the UK. International students pay more than £20K per year to study in the UK, with exorbitant housing costs on top. Immigration is a merry-go-round money-making scheme now, gov is raking in billions from visas and tuition fees, and immigration lawyers are making banks (I paid £3000 to an immigration lawyer to help my wife with her spouse visa paperwork). Big businesses can fill in roles at much lower costs. Immigrants usually work a lot harder and are more driven than local Brits, we are all here for economic opportunities, which is why u never hear people from overseas go to live in Swansea. 

2, Integration for immigrants is a joke in the UK. To be able to speak English properly is not a requirement to become a naturalised citizen in the UK, gov does not look at your level of integration, whether you are suited to the local community, or whether you are making a positive contribution to British society. The whole citizenship application process is a box-ticking exercise. I qualify as UK citizen based on the fact I have lived in the UK for 10 years as per the private life provision in the European Human Rights Convention. I have met many fellow immigrants, many of them don't speak much English nor do they have an interest in integrating. I think UK gov could have provided more incentives to immigrants to learn English and participate in the community. But I guess there is no budget to hire more immigration officers to look at citizenship applications more thoroughly.

3, Extremism is a huge issue with mass migration. Since UK has left EU, the number of migrants from EU has dropped significantly, now most growth in the immigrants come from Nigeria, Pakistan, India and Afghanistan. They have completely different values to the UK and the public naively believes these immigrants all want to be like mainstream Brits, or their kids grow up in the UK will assimilate. I personally believe one day there is going to be a rude awakening in this country about how divided people are. Just look at the recent saga with the Israel and Palestine conflict, it has become a big issue impacting Western politics. This division will get much worse in the future.

4, Political correctness regarding race is also another big issue. It is almost a taboo subject in the UK. It is an extremely racist opinion stating that immigrants from Europe will be a better fit for the UK society than African ones. Maintaining the racial makeup of the UK is crucial for social cohesion. However, we are not even allowed to discuss this issue, which I believe is detrimental to the UK in the long term.

5, the Immigration system in the UK is too complex and bounded by many antiquated international treaties from 70 years ago. Getting anything changed will be extremely difficult. The principles of UK immigration system is based on the European Convention of Human Rights. Many crucial international treaties UK with Europe is also based on ECHR like the Good Friday agreement. 

Immigration is an issue that is too complex. I doubt that the upcoming Labour government will be able to do much about it either. The realization will dawn on many people. If mass migration stops, both the housing market and the economy could face severe downturns. I don't even believe immigration is the main issue facing this country; rather, it's the low growth and lack of economic competitiveness across almost every sector. Simply stopping people from coming into the country will not address these issues, but immigration makes for effective politics.",2024-03-01T15:07:01+00:00
tories,comment,Israel-Palestine Conflict/Conflict,ksz9hby,AMightyDwarf,,"Many things to pick apart here, I’ll give it a go. 

1. We will never be told a true cost/benefit analysis for immigration so saying it’s profitable or not is impossible, never mind saying that it’s the most profitable industry. What we see is that in the era of mass migration that GDP has marginally increased but GDP per capita has flatlined and that’s the one I’m bothered about because it’s a measure of my money. Big businesses having access to cheaper labour is a bad thing because it hurts workers rights and ability to argue pay. You may be here for economic reasons but I’m here because it’s my home. Also FYI Swansea is around 35% people from recent immigrant background, they do want to go there. 

2. I agree that integration is a joke. I’ve lived in an area where council documents were sent out as standard in multiple languages because people refuse to even do the minimum. I’ve been in hospitals where it’s signposted up in multiple languages. That should not happen. I no longer primarily identify as British because it’s a civic identity that’s been watered down so much it barely holds meaning. My primary identity is English because an ethnic identity that still just about means something. 

3. I agree that extremism is a problem brought on by mass migration the only difference is that you say there will be an awakening. The alarm clock rang when the grooming gang scandals came to light and the country stayed in bed. 

4. It’s not racist to suggest that people from western democracies will have a better time integrating to a western democracy. The racist opinion is saying that maintaining the racial makeup of a place is needed for cohesion. It’s not. What’s needed is primarily a mutual respect and understanding of each other. Too often we’ve invited in people who hate our country, hate our ideals and hate our very existence. We’ve invited people in who see the country as an economic centre and thus they act to drain it of what they can. We’ve invited people in who think the ideals of their home land and home culture is better than ours. Race, skin colour, whatever don’t come into it. 

5. We should not be streamlining immigration as we should not be looking to keep bringing people in. Our population keeps growing but our infrastructure and services are not and this is breaking the very fabric of our social contract. We’ve had 20-30 years of this experiment and it’s failed. The people are not richer they are poorer with less access to services and a country that’s not able to support itself. 

The housing market having a downturn would only hurt people who are using housing as a capital store and an investment. We need the housing market to crash to get young people in a position where they can afford to buy and then maybe start families. We need the economy to feel some hurt because then businesses might decide to invest instead of hoarding wealth for a few at the top. The world is seeing a demographic crisis and we need to insulate ourselves from that now. You don’t do that by importing masses of people but by reducing the labour demand whilst increasing output. In other words AI and automation. Necessity is the mother of invention and we will not invent the groundbreaking technology of the future without first making it necessary.",2024-03-02T08:57:07+00:00
tories,comment,Israel-Palestine Conflict/Conflict,ksz6c9m,videki_man,,"Eastern European here, and I agree with almost everything you said. Although I'm not planning to stay (after we get the citizenship, we'll move back home).

I think mass immigration (at least at this unprecedented scale) will be the end of the English culture. Hell, even saying English has a racist undertone today which is absolutely mad.

Social cohesion still exists in the UK - among South Asians, among Black British, among the English - but not in the whole society. From my experience, the society is breaking up into parallel societies as we speak. The English go to pubs, go to football matches, go to historic sites. Even in towns where the English are now a minority, you won't see very diverse terraces or Asians having a pint in the pubs. We like to travel to historic sites with the family, and I'd say 95% of the visitors are English. There is a reason for that. 

It's madness that people here equal anti-immigration with racism. I work in IT, there are many fantastic people that I work with who are from other countries. But thinking that mass immigration will have no adverse impact on the local, indigenous culture is ridicoulous. Take a look at Eastern Europe. We killed our Jews and then expelled our Germans. Where is the once extremely vivid Jewish or German culture today in Eastern Europe? Nowhere, because it doesn't exist. If a nation of people disappears from a historical region for whatever reason, their culture dies with them. 

But of course, this is my opinion only. I know an overwhelming majority of the English (or Welsh, or Scottish) would not agree with me or call me downright racist.",2024-03-02T08:17:51+00:00

It was a troubled time for NI, and politicians reached out to the IRA, even those known to be active terrorists such as those two. Was that traitorous on behalf of Edward Heath's Tory government?

tories,post,IDF,17bbxjx,LeChevalierMal-Fait,BBC verify vs twitter amateurs on the gaza hopsital bombing,"As some of you may have seen there was a tragic event in gaza, an explosion near a hospital that's understandably quite packed. Below is the BBC verify article on it;

[Gaza hospital: What video, pictures and other evidence tell us about Al-Ahli hospital blast - BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67144061)

Note the sub headings: ""the blast"" ""Visual evidence from the blast site"", ""the victims"", ""what we don't know""

what exactly do they bring to the table as new or ""verified information"" - simply that there was a bombing? nobody seems to deny that.

and at least I can credit to them they for saying;

>One of the most critical pieces of evidence is the nature of the crater left behind by the explosion.  
>  
>The IDF say that the absence of a large crater, or blast damage to adjacent buildings, proves that the explosion was not caused by its weapons.  
>  
>In the image below, you can see one small crater and we are investigating the other marks.

But at what point do you go there wasn't a fucking crater. How many images / angles do you have to see before going yeah its not there. And think about it whats the first thing you photograph if there is a huge crater and a bomb site? Both because the worst damage will be there and because its the most abnormal.

But whats the point of a verification account if its just there to do ""hamas say x, idf say y"" here is our fair and balanced summary

I don't think it takes a great intellect to look at that car park, the small craters, small shrapnel holes in cars and think - maybe this is consistent with **something exploding above the carpark.**

And lets just look at what information is publically available the first thread was posted two days ago on Tuesday! The day of the explosion. From multiple people showing geolocated videos of rockets being fired from gaza prematurely exploding. And the point of that explosion matches the hospital as do the time stamps.

[https://x.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390254935851272](https://x.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390254935851272?s=20https://x.com/SamuelSokol/status/1714590563901620529?s=20)[s=20](https://x.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390254935851272?s=20https://x.com/SamuelSokol/status/1714590563901620529?s=20)

And then you have this Israeli TV has footage of the rockets malfunctioning, posted 9 hours before the BBC verify story.

[https://x.com/SamuelSokol/status/1714590563901620529?s=20](https://x.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390254935851272?s=20https://x.com/SamuelSokol/status/1714590563901620529?s=20)

Lastly, you have the IDF press briefing, again given a day or so before that shows a radar map of gaza when rockets were fired. You also have IDF signals intelligence (intercepted cellphone calls) from militants saying we fucked up basically.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yddy8zjnm3vb1.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=2be00a9ce58c6a40e3471ac4afd8d3970ec7c686

So whether you want to trust the IDF or not, you have video-recorded by Gazans, by Israelis and then radar from the IDF all agreeing on a narrative and for some of those videos there's metadata/timestamps that would give them credibility.

\---

All in all should we be surprised BBC verify seems to be an organization set up to provide a ""fact check"" to political stories to add content to contentious claims. And we have had quite a few posts on this sub looking at if BBC verify has its own biases.

But when covering actual subjects of real events, wars/bombings - possibly where even the harshest critiques of BBC verify might say ""yeah this is something that its worth the BBC doing"" they look even more hopeless. They are journalism or gender studies majors who appear so far behind what people in the open-source intelligence (OSINT) community are doing - (geolocations using satellite maps, getting metadata from videos to give authenticity to the time it was taken). In comparison, BBC verifies story is out of date and feels almost a generation behind in terms of its methods. Like racing against a Ferrari with a ford model T.

It seems a well put together article and it's clear what is a reporting of facts, what is conjecture, and the source of the conjecture.

Is your comment about the use of the term ""blast"" indicating that the language is biased? Blast seems a neutral term to me, I can't think what term I would use otherwise.

It may not require great intellect to inspect a blast pattern and draw a conclusion, but it's not a skillset I possess. I find it useful to read the analysis of military experts on this matter.

Respectfully, I think your weighting of the first threads and the timestamps of tweets suggests a certain anchoring bias. The earliest reporting is not necessarily the most accurate or authoritative purely on merit of it being first.

In sum, there are a number of inconsistencies in the reported findings. The first is that a Hamas rocket would not normally produce a blast large enough to cause the number of injured reported. So maybe it was an IDF device that exploded? Or maybe the number of injured is less than that reported?

However, the crater as shown is not large enough to be caused by the most common types of bombs the IDF launches at Gaza, so maybe it was an errant device launched from within Gaza?

The most curious aspect, however, are the inconsistent explanations provided by the IDF.

tl;dr, it was either a missile launched from Gaza that fell short, or it was an airburst munition launched from Israel.",2023-10-19T08:00:17+00:00

**The Home Affairs Select Committee needs a new chair.**

Her replacement has to be another Labour MP, but all members have a say. Potential names include Dame Diana Johnson, Hilary Benn, Rupa Huq, and Yasmin Quereshi.

**MPs return to Westminster this week after recess.**

Of course they've already come back once, to debate Afghanistan  after Kabul fell to the Taliban. Now MPs face a full week of lawmaking,  with the Elections Bill as the highlight.

**Another theme is Universal Credit.**

The temporary £20 uplift is set to expire on 6 October.

Wednesday is an Opposition Day, so expect Labour to use that as  an opportunity to pressure the government into performing a U-turn.

**And private members' bills return after a pandemic pause.**

Remember, only a few of the private members' bills listed below  will be debated because of time constraints, and only the ones with  government backing tend to pass. That's the case for Mark Jenkinson's  bill, which extends careers guidance to children in year 7.

### MONDAY 6 SEPTEMBER

**National Insurance Contributions Bill - report stage and 3rd reading**  
Introduces tax relief for employers taking on employees in a  freeport, or hiring veterans who have left the armed forces within the  last year.

### TUESDAY 7 SEPTEMBER

**Transport (Disabled Passenger Charter) Bill**

### THURSDAY 9 SEPTEMBER

**The Rating (Coronavirus) and Directors Disqualification (Dissolved Companies) Bill - report stage and 3rd reading**  
Clarifies that altering the use of a building because of the  pandemic (e.g. requirements to close or enforce social distancing)  doesn't count as a ""material change of circumstances"" for business rates  purposes. Many business owners had argued this because it can  lower their building's assumed rental value, potentially reducing  business rates in the future. Also closes a legal loophole by giving the  Insolvency Service powers to investigate the directors of dissolved  companies. Previously, some directors had fraudulently avoided repaying  government-backed coronavirus loans by closing down their businesses.

### FRIDAY 10 SEPTEMBER

Private members' bill presented by Mel  Stride.

NI's Jewish population is shrinking into obscurity, barely able to hold a congregation

Meanwhile south of the Border in Ireland, the jewish population has growing fourfold in 30 years, and has no problems sourcing Kosher food.

This argues that the NIP would suit Irish Jews better, as they would obtain their Kosher food from the sources that the Irish Jewish population obtain it from. 

Far closer, cheaper and faster.

Secondly, the Jewish population is 0.001% of the population or less.

58% of the NI electorate voted for pro-Protocol parties in the recent Assembly election.

Therefore, Boris should be concerned with 58% of the electorate, not the 0.001%

If Corbyn is antisemitic for anti-occupation of Palestine by Israel, then are many Jews + myself also antisemite?

The media will attempt to character-assinate any Labour leader with a vision of a fairer society. The problem with Corbyn, however, is that he has been an MP for over 30 years. His history provides a lot of ammunition for the media to attack him with relative to an alternative Labour leader. Throughout Corbyn's political career he has been opinionated and chimed in on a myriad of complex issues. It is too easy for the media to misrepresent his views or to point out instances of Corbyn having been on the wrong side of history with the benefit of hindsight. Labour must continue a strong socialist vision - it is required to rebalance a society rigged in favour of the wealthy. The figurehead for this though is not Corbyn. Pick a leader with a similar vision but with little history, who is less ideological and willing to attack the opposition and Labour will stand a better chance.",2019-12-14T01:59:36+00:00

Yes, unfortunately. The definition of antisemtism is being altered to include anti zionism and opposing apartheid. This is happening particularly in the US, but [even in places like france.](https://www.france24.com/en/20191203-new-french-bill-equating-anti-zionism-with-anti-semitism-is-going-very-far-afield)

As a result, the word ""antisemitic"" has lost all meaning to me, and under this new definition, I have no problems being called one.  There is a silver lining though; antisemitism, as it used to be defined, is no different than any other form of racism or bigotry.

But a change towards intelligent behaviour can be fostered in the electorate, or ""character-assasination"" by media will happen every time to REAL visionary socialist leader, ie media elects our PM through subjective ""portrayal"" - not right (remember Thatcher pacts with Sun). Idealistic sure i know, but you know that's progressive.

The 30  or years so in politics is a badge of honour surely? not a field-day for moron media types to ""misrepresent"" to public. We choose our leader not Mudoch! He is the archetype English phlegmatic character representing a proud tradition in gerontocratic rule. Deep history of politics should not be baggage but badge of honour.

After this defeat Corbyn will attack in Parliament aggressively and be offensive. Corbyn would have been  a true leader that let his manifesto speak for the Party and all it was created by. Not for tv-viewing and digestion razzmatazz. Sky News broadcast as the ""Brexit Election"". They framed a single issue which Corbyn admittedly chose a consensus approach on, as the critical factor. What if BBC had labelled it ""Saving Our NHS Election""!

Leader does not need to change to play up to media antics, but reform in pitical broadcasting is needed. There was apathy in politics with low turnout by public, but Brexit + Corbyn reinvigorated the electorate to take politics seriously.

Change political-broadcasting for framing narratives that are lies + DECEIT, not change leader to fit media. Or we get likes of Blair - a sell-out low-fibre politician who would sell his grandmother to win votes! or Cameron a lightweight politician but camera-pleasing.",2019-12-14T09:02:42+00:00

But at the end of the day, politics is about a narrative that will get you half of the population + 1 voting for you, and then you do whatever you want. 

Labour has to understand that now. They need to rebuild the party based on simple ideas, not 100 pages manifestos. They need to stop trying to please every single minority group. They need to stop giving every single person a voice. They need a few ideas everyone can go behind, and that's it. 

People like AOC and Bernie in the US understand that, that's why they only talk about healthcare for all, green new deal and more taxes for the rich. That's all. 

Another issue with Labour compared to the Tories is that they don't control the narrative. They feel like they need to have an opinion on everything, and let anything interrupt their message. Look at what happened with the antisemitism thing. Corbyn should have ignored that entirely, fire people if they said anything wrong, then remind everyone the party is not antisemetic, and move on. Not spend months into a useless debate no one cares about.

People were never concerned about Corbyn being antisemetic. Why the hell did he spend so much time dealing with this? This is weak leadership.",2019-12-14T09:22:40+00:00

According to Finkelstein, this ""Holocaust industry"" has corrupted Jewish culture and the authentic memory of the Holocaust.

Im not sure there is a significant movement of being anti- any of those things;  the word has nothing to do with judaism, and even less with zionism let alone apartheid.

brexit,comment,Israel-Palestine,farmptc,WikiTextBot,,"**Haredim and Zionism**

From the start of political Zionism in the 1890s, Haredi leaders voiced objections to its secular orientation, and before the establishment of the State of Israel, the vast majority of Haredi Jews were opposed to Zionism. This was chiefly due to the concern that secular nationalism would replace the Jewish faith and the observance of religion, and the view that it was forbidden for the Jews to re-constitute Jewish rule in the Land of Israel before the arrival of the Messiah. Those rabbis who did support Jewish settlement in Palestine in the late 19th century had no intention to conquer Palestine and declare its independence from the rule of the Ottoman Turks, and some preferred that only observant Jews be allowed to settle there.During the 1930s, some European Haredi leaders encouraged their followers not to leave for Palestine where the Zionists were gaining influence. When the dangers facing European Jewry became clear, the Haredi Agudath Israel organization decided to cooperate with Zionist leaders to an extent in order to allow religious Jews the possibility of seeking refuge in Palestine.

Now, this is certainly a post where I am being Somewhat sarcastic, still trying not to strand that far from the truth. If it is too much to stay, feel free to remove the topic Mods.

Also is about specific things that are said. There is really no need to feel personally touched by things because you voted for Brexit but you are at the same time not engaging in these talking points, if that is teh case you are clearly not the target of this.

I hope that while this is somewhat poking fun at brexit, it can also spark some conversation

* *No legal obligation* = Our word has no value. Whenever you enter an agreement with us do not believe anything we say until is bound by a faustian contract for our soul and do not try to offer us any flexibility. Our only use for flexibility is to try to weasel out from every thing we ever promised.

* *Take back our Sovereignty* = I don't like to work with others. The only thing that satisfies me is when it is my way or the highway.

* *The EU is undemocratic* = I never bothered to vote at the european elections, nor I ever learned how they work, but for someone who never spent a single minute getting involved with it I am sure quite opinionated.

brexit,comment,West Bank,dsnu0p4,mr-strange,,"I'd like to dispute a couple of those:

* _The EU is undemocratic_ = votes from people who are not like me don't count.

This one puzzled me for a long time. The debate usually goes along the lines of... _R:&nbsp;How is it not democratic? L:&nbsp;Here's a list of differences between EU practices and those of the UK. R:&nbsp;But those differences are just skin-deep, or simply emulate the way things are done in the US..._ followed by an increasingly intricate discussion of the minutiae of Parliamentary procedures.

It never seemed to me that Brexiteers had anything of real substance to say on the issue. That puzzled me, because it's one of their principle talking points. But eventually I realised that it was actually another dog whistle. ""Anti-democratic"" doesn't *really* mean anything about processes or institutions. The key phrase is: ""dictated to by Brussels"". *That's* what they don't like.

The EU's institutions will *always* be dominated by foreigners, just because of the numbers. Making them more democratic *just makes that worse*. That's why Eurosceptics were so against qualified majority voting, or a directly elected EU president.

So when they complain that the ""EU is undemocratic"" they are really objecting to foreigners having any say. Which leads me on to....

* _We want to do FTA with everybody ASAP_ = we have never heard of ""non-tariff barriers"".

Seriously, if you have never heard of ""non-tariff barriers"" to trade, then the whole Brexiteer position becomes much more comprehensible. The only barriers to trade become tariffs, and leaving the EU for ""WTO rules"" starts to look like it makes sense.

Without an understanding of non-tariff barriers, they also miss the need for cross border harmonisation of regulations. That feeds back into the ""EU = undemocratic"" notion, because if you don't see the need for supranational regulations, then you can also dismiss the need for any supranational input when *making* those regulations.

brexit,comment,West Bank,dsn9nas,ajehals,,">Is there anything I forgot?

There are probably a few, but it highlights a really interesting issue in terms of people engaging with their own idea of what the other sides arguments are, rather than the other sides argument (happens in both directions, and I've said this far too often..). It's been odd to see people utterly talk past each other purely because they think they know what those that disagree with them *really* mean when they say X or Y.

The classic two from your list would be the 'sovereignty' argument and the FTA argument. I mean it's perfectly valid for people to want to see the UK engaged with Europe on a level somewhere below complete political union, but not dive all the way down to isolationism! Same goes on the trade side, there is nothing unreasonable about people wanting to look globally rather than regionally for trade.

Still, I can't see the whole 'everyone is talking past each other' thing being sorted for a while, at the moment it's just far easier than engaging on the issues, and both sides seem to prefer to preach to their own choirs than gain converts..

brexit,comment,West Bank,dsookb5,ajehals,,">The Leave ""argument"" is so full of racist dog-whistles that it's impossible to debate it at face value. 

Firstly, no it isn't, although that is another excuse to ignore the issues and to simply argue your own view as I suppose. I suppose if it's all racist dog whistles then why bother? Much easier that way, not sure it helps anything, but I suppose it might make you feel a bit better.  

That said, you aren't wrong that some people use their position on the EU to mask a racist or xenophobic foundation, you see that from some fringe leave voters (I'd argue especially within the vocal, UKIP sort of groupings) but also from remain advocates (one of the arguments that I kept seeing here was the notion that leaving the EU was bad because it meant we'd reduce immigration of white Europeans and have to increase immigration of Muslims and blacks.. lovely...).  The bulk of the arguments for leaving the EU have nothing to do with racism or xenophobia, for large portions of the leave vote, they aren't even about immigration..

>Taken at face value, you'd logically expect that making the EU more democratic would make them happier. But nothing could be further from the truth. Attempts to improve democratic accountability within the EU are fiercely resisted by Eurosceptics. 

You say this like it's fact. It isn't. Measures intended to increase democratic accountability are often rejected or supported by people from both sides of the EU debate, because they often don't address the core issues or they are part of larger reform packages that alter the balance of power and the areas where people can have an active say.  They are often not 'free' either, coming at the cost of compromises in other areas.  Moreover, some of the very fundamental issues (like say the sheer size of the EU as an issue in diluting individual control) can't easily be addressed without changes that go counter to the current EU approach.

>Trying to unpack the issue with them leads to utterly bizarre conversations where they'll concede that the specific institutions are structured in a similar way to the UK or US, yet despite everything, they'll still insist that they are Undemocratic!

Why is that bizarre? The UK has a bit of a democratic deficit too, as does the US... Having similarly structured institutions is part of that of course, but there is a lot more too it.  I think the problem here isn't so much the leave argument, but one of the common remain responses (although I should add I've had some great discussions in this area...) seems to assume that if the UK has a democratic deficit, then you can't use that as an argument for leaving the EU.. Which obviously doesn't make any sense..  As to the EU being undemocratic, it is less democratic than it could be, it has some major issues, structural, some around ensuring that national governments retain control, some where the institutional structure is designed to paper over the cracks, and then simple practicalities.

>You have to understand that to a Eurosceptic, EU is undemocratic isn't a criticism that can be addressed, or an argument that can be debated... rather it is an axiom. To them, the very idea of the EU stands opposed to that of democracy. There is no way to make it democratic, because in their eyes democracy can only include the in group.

To some certainly and that's also not unreasonable. In fact there should be a certain level of scepticism aimed at any powerful governing group, at any level.  The problem that many people have with the EU in particular does stem from the fact that the EU is used as a tool by national governments to short circuit national democracies, and that the EU as a group seems to have an agenda that isn't based on some sort of popular mandate.  In short, it is not unreasonable to take the position that the EU would rather not listen to people, and that it will use any opportunity, from crisis to threat, to push a particular internationalist and centralising model for the EU.  

That said, I'd argue that's more of a minority view.  The more common one (At least in my experience) is the one that the EU, and most of its members, are pushing in a direction that is very different to what most people (most remain voters included..) in the UK want.  That may or may not be democratic (the UK is after all just one country in the block..) but it certainly is troubling. If you then don't feel that you have the capacity, leverage or power to enact changes that you'd prefer, or at least apply a brake then surely you'd be right to be concerned?
 
>That's why I argue that properly understood, it's just a restatement of the sovereignty ""argument"".

The sovereignty argument is essentially one of degrees of self rule and latitude in governance. That the UK is less free to act within a political and economic union than it would be outside of one to act in its interests (domestically and elsewhere). That's perfectly valid and quite different wouldn't you say? It somewhat annoys me when people then take that to the extremes (As though being in the EU means giving up all sovereignty rather than the reality in which some is simply 'pooled', or as though the only way a country could possibly exercise more control would be to removing the UK from every international agreement...)...

But again, the point here is that most of the remain arguments I've seen (especially in the press) aimed at leave positions seem to utterly miss the mark, as such they do little to actually change minds. Not to mention that they leave some proportion of remain supporters woefully misinformed  as to what the issues actually are. I mean, lets face it, if this had really been a contest between racists and non-racists, xenophobes and non-xenophobes, the latter group would have won on every count, because frankly it's larger and more engaged.  The problem is that simply claiming that the other side is racist and xenophobic and that that alone is a good enough reason to vote the other way isn't really as effective as it might be.",2018-01-14T22:29:05+00:00

brexit,post,Ceasefire,7c0pqu,AmericanStuff,Brexit - UK doesn't seem to understand.,"Let's keep this simple.

A hard border imposed by Brits on the island of Ireland means war.

For trade purposes the border must be in the Irish Sea........nothing else is  acceptable.  The Brits did not think about the Irish/EU border with the UK. All the Little Englanders thought the English Channel was all they needed to protect their island from Johnny Foreigner. Well that was so stupid as to be beyond incompetence.

 Ireland is a co-guarrantor of the Good Friday Agreement......this requires no border in Ireland. If the Brits renege from that  International Agreement then they will reap the whirlwind. It took over eight years of negotiations to have a ceasefire followed by the Agreement. Now the Brits want to tear it up by thinking that the Six Counties can be sealed off.....and remain as if they are still part of the UK and that nothing has changed.

Well, the Good Friday Agreement has changed everything Britain is bound by that agreement.

We will not allow the same treason of Carson and the Curragh Mutiny to get away with it agai.

The Brits were too scared to face down the UNionists in 1920,......now the May Regime has the DUP treasonists shoring up its Government.......they are treasonists because they are betraying the will of the Northern Irish people who voted to remain in the EU....with the rest of the island. Now the extremists in England, derived from their military backgrounds and pretensions  ( see Ian Duncan Smith)   risk peace on this island for the maintenance of their post colonial fading sense of imperialism - ""global britain""   hahaha.

This problem  of the Irish Border was created by Britain in 1920; 
it is now being recreated by Britain with their complete failure to consider the consequences of their disastrous decision to leave the EU.

If the UK is prepared to accept a degree of smuggling and provide for virtual, electronic customs formalities, then it has no need to build any infrastructure on the border for traffic arriving from the RoI.

The EU might not see it that way, of course, in which case they might force the RoI to build a hard customs border.  But if that happens, then the consequences are all on the EU's shoulders, not the UK's.

This is literally impossible because Ireland has free trade with the rest of the EU.  It opens up a massive hole for smuggling stuff into the EU/UK - just send it through the Irish border.

The border is a result of the UK decision to leave custom union. Everybody knew ( or would have if they had bothered to really look into the facts before voting) that this problem would arise.
I agree that all parties would like freedom of movement for residents, that is exactly the point. But nobody knows how to do it.
How are you going to allow only residents to pass through if there is no border? Ireland is part of eu so freedom of movement applies. So anybody in EU could just go to Ireland , Northern Ireland and travel to UK from there.
Besides wasn't brexit all about taking back control of the borders? You would have to check passports at the cross between NI and GB anyway, at that point might as well check  goods there too.


> Or there is a trade exception that states goods/services made in the UK can be exported to IR for use/consumption in IR and vice verse. Im sure the UK would not have any problems with this at all.

Same problem.
At the moment UK is part of eu custom union, so they only allow imports that are allowed in the whole EU.
If they exit custom union and change their regulation so goods that are not allowed in EU are then allowed in UK you will need to inspect all the goods going through between NI and RI to make sure that: they have been produced in NI ( and not imported from a third country) and follow European regulation.
How would you do that without a border and lots of paperwork?

> What about the above proposal, free movement, no need for checks (after all this is not up to the EU since IR is not part of Schengen) it is already the case if you have a visa for the UK you can visit IR and vice verse no need for passport control. 

Again, if you don't check passports you are for all intents and purposes allowing anybody in EU to go to UK. People in UK would possibly be stopped when trying to exit ROI, as they are not in Schengen, I'm not sure about that.
The common travel area between Ireland and UK only works because they're both in EU. That's one of the reasons they joined together. Before it worked because neither of them was in EU.
So although in theory UK could leave the border open that would be very stupid, you'd have much less control on your border than you have now being in eu.

> for the trade of goods create a rule as described above. (sure some people will break the rules but the big companies will not get away with it and that is what is important) 
Putting a hard EU broader anywhere be it between NI and IR or between NI and the rest of the UK will start a war. 

See above. If UK/NI exits the custom union goods will need to be tracked, quality inspected etc etc.
You can't just say everybody is allowed to trade freely with ROI unless tracking, inspections etc are in place to guarantee  the goods have actually been made in NI and conform to EU standards.
Or you can just say that NI is part of the custom union and follows European law in terms of goods etc etc, and at that point you move the border to the crossing with UK.

By Graham Keeley

IN MADRID – Britons have planned protests outside the British embassy in Madrid next week as anger mounted over the failure of diplomats to reach a deal over the ban on UK driving licences in Spain.

Thousands of Britons in Spain who did not convert their UK driving licences to Spanish versions by the deadline of December 2020 are currently not allowed to drive after post-Brexit talks post down.

An extension to allow British residents to use their UK licences has expired but this does not affect tourists or hauliers.

After five months of talks, Spanish and British diplomats have failed to reach a deal.

A Facebook page called Invasion of the British Embassy in Madrid for the driving licence has been set up to articulate the anger of those who cannot take to the road.

After angry Britons said they would stage a protest last week, the British embassy issued a statement saying that it was urgently trying to reach a deal.

In response, Pascal Siegmund, one of the protest organisers, wrote: “We are writing this post following the useless (British) Embassy update. The embassy update didn’t satisfy any of us. We are going to go further (and) organise a protest.”

He said a demonstration may take place on Thursday 22 September in Madrid outside the British embassy and the Spanish Ministry of Transport.

Deb Lee, 63, who is originally from Oxford but now lives on a campsite in Catral near Alicante on the Costa Blanca, has been stranded for the past five months because she is unable to drive.

“I lived in a remote finca but had to move to a campsite where there was a supermarket nearby. I have wasted about €500 (£434) in wasted car insurance and tax while my car sits in the drive,” she told i.

“This has been a disaster for me and thousands of others but the diplomats cannot seem to reach a deal.”

Mrs Lee, whose husband still works in Britain as a lorry driver, moved permanently to Spain in 2020.

“After bad advice from an adviser about changing my licence, I missed out on the deadline. Now I don’t want to sit the Spanish driving test on principle,” she said.

“I have been a safe driver for over 40 years, without a point on my licence. How is it fair that an 18-year-old British tourist can come over here and rent a car at an airport, but I cannot drive.”

She said she has suffered stress because she has been left stranded by the licence ban.

Mrs Lee needs dental work, but taxi fares to the nearest surgery are about €50 every time she goes for treatment.

The British embassy in Spain tweeted: “We recognise that negotiations are taking longer than anticipated and longer than either you or we want.

“We are genuinely making progress on the outstanding points but, for reasons we have explained before, we cannot be definitive about the timescale.”

British diplomats urged those who must drive to consider taking a Spanish driving test but acknowledged this may not be easy.

The embassy added: “We know that this is frustrating to hear and we don’t underestimate the impact on those of you who are affected.”

The Spanish Ministry of Transport did not reply to a request for comment from i.",2022-09-19T09:43:10+00:00

I took the Spanish driving test there to get a valid license (since those of us from the US can't even exchange it).

Throughout Corbyn's political career he has been opinionated and chimed in on a myriad of complex issues. It is too easy for the media to misrepresent his views or to point out instances of Corbyn having been on the wrong side of history with the benefit of hindsight. Labour must continue a strong socialist vision - it is required to rebalance a society rigged in favour of the wealthy. The figurehead for this though is not Corbyn.

But a change towards intelligent behaviour can be fostered in the electorate, or ""character-assasination"" by media will happen every time to REAL visionary socialist leader, ie media elects our PM through subjective ""portrayal"" - not right (remember Thatcher pacts with Sun). Idealistic sure i know, but you know that's progressive.

The 30  or years so in politics is a badge of honour surely? not a field-day for moron media types to ""misrepresent"" to public. We choose our leader not Mudoch! He is the archetype English phlegmatic character representing a proud tradition in gerontocratic rule. Deep history of politics should not be baggage but badge of honour.

After this defeat Corbyn will attack in Parliament aggressively and be offensive. Corbyn would have been  a true leader that let his manifesto speak for the Party and all it was created by. Not for tv-viewing and digestion razzmatazz. Sky News broadcast as the ""Brexit Election"". They framed a single issue which Corbyn admittedly chose a consensus approach on, as the critical factor. What if BBC had labelled it ""Saving Our NHS Election""!

Leader does not need to change to play up to media antics, but reform in pitical broadcasting is needed. There was apathy in politics with low turnout by public, but Brexit + Corbyn reinvigorated the electorate to take politics seriously.

Change political-broadcasting for framing narratives that are lies + DECEIT, not change leader to fit media. Or we get likes of Blair - a sell-out low-fibre politician who would sell his grandmother to win votes! or Cameron a lightweight politician but camera-pleasing.",2019-12-14T09:02:42+00:00

Labour has to understand that now. They need to rebuild the party based on simple ideas, not 100 pages manifestos. They need to stop trying to please every single minority group. They need to stop giving every single person a voice. They need a few ideas everyone can go behind, and that's it. 

People like AOC and Bernie in the US understand that, that's why they only talk about healthcare for all, green new deal and more taxes for the rich. That's all. 

Another issue with Labour compared to the Tories is that they don't control the narrative. They feel like they need to have an opinion on everything, and let anything interrupt their message. Look at what happened with the antisemitism thing. Corbyn should have ignored that entirely, fire people if they said anything wrong, then remind everyone the party is not antisemetic, and move on. Not spend months into a useless debate no one cares about.

From the start of political Zionism in the 1890s, Haredi leaders voiced objections to its secular orientation, and before the establishment of the State of Israel, the vast majority of Haredi Jews were opposed to Zionism. This was chiefly due to the concern that secular nationalism would replace the Jewish faith and the observance of religion, and the view that it was forbidden for the Jews to re-constitute Jewish rule in the Land of Israel before the arrival of the Messiah. Those rabbis who did support Jewish settlement in Palestine in the late 19th century had no intention to conquer Palestine and declare its independence from the rule of the Ottoman Turks, and some preferred that only observant Jews be allowed to settle there.During the 1930s, some European Haredi leaders encouraged their followers not to leave for Palestine where the Zionists were gaining influence. When the dangers facing European Jewry became clear, the Haredi Agudath Israel organization decided to cooperate with Zionist leaders to an extent in order to allow religious Jews the possibility of seeking refuge in Palestine.

* It is staggering that you seek to *punish* people for having a different opinion to you.  It's frankly disturbing.  This is what democracy means to you?  If you had more power you would probably do more to hurt these people?  Merely for having different political views.  Inform yourself on how well that has worked out in other parts of the world.  Let's punish people who think differently.  Omg.  I'm a leave voter because I genuinely think it will be the best for us in the long run.  But you'd seek to punish me for such ""evil"" views?  


I don't know what else to say.  Take a look in the mirror and ask yourself who is really evil here.  All I want is the best for my country and genuinely believe this is for the best.  You on the other hand, would seek to hurt my company and my employees because I have different political views.


Absolutely mind fuckingly astonishingly disturbing.  What a piece of work.  This is what remain voters stoop to.  I will point to this thread next time remains claim to be so pure.  Omg.

But first which of these companies do you own?  I'm very happy to have caught your eye so quickly.  We would all be genuinely interested to know.   How much money do you have to lose before you start firing people?

The aim of this exercise is not to punish employees of any company, and in one of the comments on one of the two threads I explicitly ask people not to be nasty to the employees.

&#x200B;

The reality is that Brexit funding was almost exclusively provided by the richest members of society, who are seeking to impose their views on those who are less fortunate.  The only way to redress the balance is to try and reduce the capital these people have available.  And that can be accomplished by boycotting the businesses that generated their cash in the first place.

&#x200B;

Shop at Sainsbury's instead of Morrison's!! Use Bet365 for sports betting!  Don't use Autoglym car products!

&#x200B;

Take Langholm Capital who own the following brands:  Tyrells Crisps,  Dorset Cereals, Purity Soft Drinks, WoolOvers (online knitwear), Just  Retirement.   If  a boycott of these is successfull, what will happen is that the other partners in Langholm Capital will notice the pinch and buy Albert Wiegman out to restore consumer confidence in their portfolio companies and brands.  Noone at Langholm Capital is going to lose their job because of this.

&#x200B;

With PC World / Dixons - this scheme will hopefully lead to Stanley Kalms being removed as President for Life.  Look at his comments on Muslims.  Loads of Muslims work and shop at his stores, and if they knew about his views they would definitely be appalled, as should any normal person.   I'm happy  to give that guy publicity - I would never have known about him if he hadn't thrown his money at Brexit.  I saw on one of your posts that you already equate Muslims with terrorists so this probably won't put you off shopping at PC World.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, we are not able to stop large landowners taking free money from the EU - e.g. Dyson and the £1.8m a year he receives in subsidies, but we can revel in his hypocrisy.

&#x200B;

As for your first point, ridiculing this as an inconvenience for those taking part - on the contrary, people will delight in participating in this, even with the full knowledge that to one of those Brexit backers losing 50 pence is nothing.

brexit,post,Palestine Liberation Organization,eahkw7,MOSDemocracy,"Corbynism was not rejected, Labour should not pivot to the 'centre'. It it is ‘remain’ that lost and not Corbynism, Labour’s rhetoric is winning with the Conservatives promising to expand the NHS, hire more police and end austerity","**Seeing all the frustrated reactions to the latest election among many it is important to remember that the Centrists’ biggest fear is not that Labour will lose another election pursuing Corbynism, but in fact, it is that Labour will actually win an election with these policies. Every attempt to blame this loss on Labour’s policies, other than Brexit, must be resisted.**

To properly treat any malfunction of the body we have to diagnose it properly. The same applies to organisations and even nations. The question about the future of Labour can be answered properly only if we properly understand the reason for that loss.

**The mandate of Thursday was clear: ‘get Brexit done’.** To pretend that the election was about anything else other than Brexit is extremely dangerous. Moreover, it was ‘remain’ that was resoundingly defeated, not Corbynism. Boris Johnson wanted the election to be entirely about Brexit. Ever since David Cameron called for the referendum and leave won in 2016 that is the only issue dominating British politics and particularly affecting the conservatives, who have been ruling the country.

The latest election was also the result of internal bickering within the conservative party. Theresa May repeatedly lost in Parliament and could not make any of her agreements pass. Her resignation led to internal elections within the conservative party. Boris Johnson became Prime Minister after winning the internal elections. When his own Brexit deal with the EU stumbled because of rebel MPs, he purged them from the party leading to a minority government. Only then did he call for elections, with the entire party and in particular all the MP candidates, rallying behind his agreement with the EU. He wanted a clear mandate from the people with a large enough majority so that he can bulldoze his Brexit deal through parliament. It was Labour under Corbyn that wanted the election not to be entirely about Brexit. Labour was caught in a tight spot because the overwhelming majority of Labour voters also voted remain in the 2016 referendum. **We should not forget that just a few months ago it looked like the Liberal Democrats, who adopted a stance of remain, promising to completely stop the Brexit process, were going to overtake Labour. So Corbyn was forced to adapt their new Brexit policy, which tried to appeal to both sides of the debate**, by promising a second referendum on the issue if they win power.

If you are a Brexit supporter what would you want? More haggling with EU by a new Labour government and the prospect of another referendum or just trying to get over with Brexit by supporting Borish Johnson? Labour Brexiteers just sat out instead of voting in many places it appears. So it is crystal clear that remain has been defeated resoundingly in this election. The Liberal Democrats and the Greens are nowhere to be seen and the Conservatives, the only party promising an immediate Brexit, won a resounding mandate.

## Corbynism was not rejected

Let us come to Corbynism, or socialism as Corbyn calls it. These are just moderate social democrat policies, already adopted across Europe, and many like higher corporate taxes and ending universal credit just take the UK back to 2010, that are popular amongst the populace. How can we be sure that this election is not a rejection of Corbynism?Look at Europe where all the social democratic parties that ruled after the war have been destroyed completely post the 2008 recession. France, Germany, Greece. Everywhere it is the same story. Cling to “centrism”, neoliberalism, whatever you call it. **All those parties left of centre have been decimated. But Labour survived in Britain. This is an anomaly that has to be explained.**

Labour got 30% of the votes in 2015 with “Centrist” policies after 5 years in opposition.If their voters actually supported “Centrism” – which only means more austerity, less worker’s rights, less civil rights, more deregulation of the financial and speculating sectors, more draconian restrictions on human rights in the name of “terror”, more budget deficits, not to invest but to bail out private companies and tax cuts for the oligarchs – they would’ve thoroughly defeated Labour in 2017. That was when Labour was under Corbyn for the first time and launched a progressive manifesto. In-fact Theresa May called for snap elections hoping for exactly that.

**The Liberal Democrats should’ve taken the place of Labour by now. That is not happening. Labour is the largest political party in Europe, Corbyn is heading a massive political movement. Labour got 32.5% of the votes in this election, which only means that they are not in danger of collapsing and not in danger of staying in opposition “forever” as those against Corbyn and his policies would like to threaten.** In fact, Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are promising to expand the NHS and are espousing anti-austerity rhetoric. This shifting of the Overton window would not be possible without Corbyn’s rise. **Thus, Labour’s rhetoric is winning when the Conservatives have to promise to expand the NHS, hire more police and end austerity.**

Once we realise that it is ‘remain’ that lost and not Corbynism, we can conclude what the path forward for Labour is, no need for another pivot to the “centre”. No need to betray the ideas of half a million members, who pay money AND work for the party. No need to destroy the new NEC, new CLPs and so on, full of members with new hope and leading a new political movement. It is ridiculous that a few elites get to decide what the party’s policies are and the cadre should blindly campaign for them. An organization like that is not called a political party. There are other suitable names for that.

## Respect People's Mandate and Democracy

This applies both to the general election, where voters chose Brexit, and the process within Labour where the members chose Corbynism, or socialism as he calls it. Not respecting the people's mandate and calling for remain even after the referendum has led to the present state of Labour in the Parliament.

Any political or social movement will take time to succeed. What should the chartist and suffragists have thought about temporary setbacks in their century-long struggle? What is the purpose of achieving power if not to implement policies that you think are good for society? Even Nigel Farage did not win any election, not even any seats in the Parliament but he succeeded in bringing about Brexit. This is the fatal flaw in the argument of “centrists”, destroyed across Europe now seek to destroy Labour in the UK. They say that they believe in all the good things but they do not want to pursue them right now, as they want to stay in power. These pretensions of compromise did nothing for decades except shift the political spectrum in the favour of a few elite and the people are sick of it. **This “centrism” is responsible for the rise of both Corbyn and Johnson.**

Labour should dump these distractions and also dump talk of remain, respecting the people’s mandate. The focus should not be on obstructing the Tories in Parliament over Brexit but to build a grassroots political movement as Corbyn has been doing over the economic and social issues.

Remember that the Centrists’ biggest fear is not that Labour will lose another election pursuing Corbynism, but in fact, it is that Labour will actually win an election with these policies. Every attempt to blame this loss on Labour’s policies, other than Brexit, must be resisted.

**Corbyn should not resign right now.** As leader, he is representative of certain ideas. Sudden exit right now will demoralize the cadre, give fuel to attacks against Labour’s policies, and lead to unnecessary bickering. He should continue until emotions calm down, the next conference is due in September and by that time, the conservatives should pass some kind of Brexit agreement into law. Corbyn should stay on as leader until the Brexit issue reaches an end.It is truly sad that Britain is not ready for a kind and compassionate leader, traits that are sorely lacking in most people in positions of power. As for Corbyn, he will continue to fight for peace, reconciliation, democracy and justice, as he was fighting all his life. More importantly, he tried doing this within Labour and successfully shifted the narrative in Britain. His tenure is a grand success considering the circumstances of Brexit and the decimation of Centre-left parties across Europe. The pendulum is swinging back; it will take some time to gather momentum. The duty for Labour is to build it in the coming years.",2019-12-14T09:06:15+00:00

If Labour had come with the offer of repairing & strengthening the public services we already have and stabilising things after what ever the referendum result was. This could have got them a first term, this would be their chance to show socialism can work here by getting the existing services running well and showing the public they’re not to be feared (and learning the lessons that will make taking utilities back into public ownership achievable). Then for a second term take on the issue of expanding the public sector, the electorate would then have a benchmark to judge if they trust you or not and if the first term was a success why wouldn’t they?

Rushing in with so many pledges, each with their own issues and need for full explanation in the heat of an election is nearly impossible. Even more so when you factor in a very partisan press and an electorate that seems more at home with sound bites than with long complex explanations of the feasibility of innovative policy ideas.

The last three years haven’t helped either Brexit through the last parliament was chaos. I’m not pointing fingers here but even the most entrenched Conservative would have to agree that the opposition parties were offered a simply grotesque series of open goals through the entirety of this period, which was only matched by the ability of the opposition to consistently fail to score. 

I do understand your wish to stay faithful to Corbyn, he’s the best offer you’ve had for decades. But clinging to him after this election signals only one thing. I say this with love and understanding as a former labour member, a former comrade. Continuing on this path you will be confined to widening the scope of the debate at best, power to actually change things will not come. Blair and Brown may not have held your beliefs or passion but they did understand the need to be elected, until the party remembers that you will continue in the same entrenched activism Corbyn has participated in his whole career.

Conservative remain voters still voted Tory, whereas Labour leave voters switched. There was no LD breakout although they were up on 2017 figures. UKIP/BP voters returned to the Conservatives. Regional remain-backing parties did well.

Assuming that all Conservative voters are leavers and vice versa for Labour is simply wrong.

The election results was more to do with a total collapse in the Labour vote than any seismic shift in Brexit opinion, combined with the desperate desire for some people to simply move on from Brexit.

The amusing thing is that Johnson's path to Brexit is far from simple and we're looking at years more negotiations, arguments, debate and potential crisis. Watch as people become less and less tolerant of the people who lied to them about the simplicity and benefits of Brexit, and then lied again about ""getting Brexit done"".",2019-12-14T11:32:37+00:00

TaxUK,post,Occupation,12guhwa,BigBoyStair,Income tax bands and taxable income,"Following a recent promotion and related salary increase in my employment, I’m trying to work out where I now sit in relation to the income tax bands. Is the figure I should use for comparison my gross annual salary minus my occupational pension contributions (which seems to equate to my “taxable income”)?

I had originally assumed my gross salary was the figure to use (which would put me in the 40% bracket), but I think I may be wrong. For info, I’m a PAYE employee.",2023-04-09T20:21:19+00:00
TaxUK,comment,Occupation,jgel3sl,CB_Yeonnie,,"Contributions to the OPS (only yours, not your employer's) decrease amount of your employment income. For example, if you earn £60k a year and contribute 6% towards your pension (£60k x 6% = £3,600), that makes your income from employment being £56,400. As long as you earn less than £100k you can deduct the full personal allowance of £12,570. That would result in you paying tax on £43,830 (£56,400 - £12,570). You will pay 20% on your first £37,700 and then 40% on the excess of that - here £6,130 (£43,830 - £37,700). I hope that makes sense.",2023-04-15T21:13:13+00:00

TaxUK,post,Occupation,saalow,Flakuzen,Portugal’s non-habitual resident taxation regime on U.K. income,"According to an article I found online, it’s possible to move to Portugal and pay “little or no tax on your income” with the non-habitual resident taxation regime (NHR).

The article says:

“Under the NHR regime, the following categories of foreign-source income and capital gains (except if sourced from a blacklisted tax haven which has not signed a double tax convention with Portugal) will be generally exempt from income tax in Portugal since they may generally be taxed in the source country, even though they will not often be taxed in the hands of non-residents in the latter country either:
• Profits derived from eligible occupations
• Royalties and associated income
• Dividends, interest and real estate income
• Capital gains from the alienation of real estate (including shares deriving more than 50% of their value from real estate) and of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic”

If I’m understanding correctly, the article claims that people with certain professions who are non habitual residents of Portugal pay 0% tax if they have non habitual residency status, is this correct? 

The article also states: 

“Foreign-source income from employers will not be taxed in Portugal if it is taxed (at whatever rate) in the source country.”

Does that mean that U.K. income from employment will not be taxed in Portugal if the individual is already paying tax in the U.K.? But what if they’re non tax resident in the U.K. and therefore have a NT tax code? 

Thanks very much for any clarifications!",2022-01-22T19:54:56+00:00
